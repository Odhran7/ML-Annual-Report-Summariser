product development and introduction 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware operating systems and software in addition our customers’ requirements and preferences rapidly evolve as do their expectations of the performance of our software and services to keep pace with these changes we maintain a vigorous program of new product development to address demands in the marketplace for our products such as enabling more flexibility and sustainable outcomes 

autodesk was founded during the platform transition from mainframe computers and engineering workstations to personal computers we have developed and sustained a compelling value proposition based upon software for the personal computer just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry over 30 years ago the software industry has undergone a transition from developing and selling perpetual licenses and onpremises products to subscriptions and cloudenabled technologies subscription plan offerings are designed to give our customers increased flexibility with how they use our products and service offerings and to attract a broader range of customers such as projectbased users and small businesses subscription plans represent a combined hybrid offering of desktop software and cloud functionality which provides a deviceindependent collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders i n order to offer better service to our customers we are transitioning our existing customers from serial numbers to named users we 

table of contents 

completed the migration of our singleuser subscriptions from serial numbers in fiscal 2021 and are transitioning multiuser subscriptions to named users through february 2024 

we dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to deliver additional automation and insights to our customers through artificial intelligence machine learning and generative design which increase efficiency and sustainability and reduce waste these investments further enhance our existing products and create new solutions and technologies which connect the workflows and data of our customers across the ecosystem of their projects and expand our market opportunity our tools connect and automate the phases of design and creation enabling greater collaboration and the seamless flow of data for individuals and teams across all phases 

our software is primarily developed internally however we also use independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities additionally we acquire or license products and technologies developed by third parties we continually review these investments to ensure that we are generating sufficient revenue or gaining a competitive advantage to justify their costs 

the majority of our research and product development is performed in the united states china singapore canada and the united kingdom however we employ experienced software developers in many of our other locations translation and localization of our products are performed in several local markets principally singapore and ireland we generally localize and translate our products into german french italian spanish russian japanese korean and simplified and traditional chinese 

we plan to continue managing significant product development operations internationally over the next several years we believe that our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize product development lower costs and integrate local market knowledge into our development activities we continually assess the significant costs and challenges including intellectual property protection against the benefits of our international development activities 

for further discussion regarding risks from our product development and introduction efforts see item 1a “risk factors” 

marketing and sales 

we sell our products and services globally primarily through indirect channels consisting of distributors and resellers we also transact directly with our enterprise and named account customers and with customers through our online autodesk branded store our indirect channel model includes both a twotiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a onetiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers we have a network of approximately 1500 resellers and distributors worldwide for fiscal 2022 approximately 65 of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers 

  

we anticipate that our channel mix will continue to change particularly as we scale our online autodesk branded store business and our largest accounts shift towards directonly business models importantly we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the near future we employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our reseller channel with our business strategies our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller networks the loss of or a significant reduction in business with any one of our major distributors or large resellers could harm our business see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

sales through our largest distributor tech data corporation and its global affiliates collectively “tech data” accounted for 36 37 and 35 of our net revenue for the fiscal years ended january 31 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively ingram micro inc “ingram micro” our secondlargest distributor accounted for 9 of autodesks total net revenue for fiscal year ended january 31 2022 and 10 of total net revenue for fiscal years ended january 31 2021 and 2020 we believe our business is not substantially dependent on either tech data or ingram micro should any of the agreements between us and tech data or ingram micro be terminated for any reason we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data or ingram micro would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue no other distributor reseller or direct customer accounted for 10 or more of our revenue 

table of contents 

our customerrelated operations are divided into three geographic regions the americas europe middle east and africa “emea” and asia pacific “apac” each geographic region is supported by global marketing and sales organizations these organizations develop and manage overall marketing and sales programs and work closely with a network of domestic and international sales offices we believe that international sales will continue to comprise the majority of our total net revenue adverse economic conditions and currency exchange rates in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue including emerging economies may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance our international operations and sales subject us to a variety of risks see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

we also work directly with reseller and distributor sales organizations computer manufacturers other software developers and peripherals manufacturers in cooperative advertising promotions and tradeshow presentations we employ massmarketing techniques such as webcasts seminars telemarketing direct mailings sponsorships advertising in business and trade journals and social media we have a worldwide user group organization and we have created online user communities dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products and services 

we generate revenue primarily through various offerings that provide recurring revenue under our subscription plan customers can use our software anytime anywhere and get access to the latest updates to previous versions through termbased product subscriptions cloud service offerings and enterprise business agreements “eba” historically we have had increased eba sale activity in our fourth fiscal quarter this seasonality may not have an immediate impact on our revenue as we recognize subscription revenue over the term of the contract this seasonality may also affect the relative value of our billings rpo and collections in the fourth and first fiscal quarters 

customer and reseller support 

we provide technical support and training to customers through a multitiered support model augmented by direct programs designed to address certain specific customer needs most of our customers receive support and training from the resellers and distributors from which they purchased subscriptions or licenses for our products or services with autodesk in turn providing secondtier support to the resellers and distributors other customers are supported directly via selfservice using the autodesk knowledge network which guides customers to answers in our online support assets support forums or webinars or to support representatives using different modalities such as social media phone email and webchat we also support our resellers and distributors through technical product training sales training classes webinars and other knowledgesharing programs

impact at autodesk 

autodesk is committed to advancing a more sustainable resilient and equitable world we don’t believe in waiting for progress we believe in making it we take action as a business and to support our employees customers and communities in our collective opportunity to design and make a better world for all 

we focus our efforts to advance positive outcomes across three primary areas energy and materials health and resilience and work and prosperity these impact opportunity areas are derived from the un sustainable development goals “sdgs” and have been focused through a multipronged process to align the top needs of our stakeholders the important issues of our business and the areas we are best placed to accelerate positive impact at scale 

these opportunities manifest as outcomes through how our customers leverage our technology to design and make netzero carbon buildings resilient infrastructure more sustainable products and a thriving workforce we realize these opportunities in our business through our 100 renewable and netzero greenhouse gas operations and inclusive culture we advance these opportunities with industry innovators through collaboration grants software donations and training

sustainability 

climate change 

in addressing the global challenges posed by climate change we make it possible for our customers to innovate and respond to associated changes in regulation building code physical climate parameters and other climaterelated developments this effort can directly and indirectly create more demand for existing and new autodesk products and services in the short and longterm furthermore our leadership is committed to taking climate action and that commitment goes hand in hand with our values and reputation in the marketplace in fiscal 2022 we integrated regular analysis of various climate scenarios into our enterprise strategy and risk processes 

climate change management actions 

to drive continued progress and meet growing demand we continue to expand the solutions education and support we offer helping customers secure a competitive advantage for a lowcarbon future by designing highperformance buildings resilient cities and infrastructure and more efficient transportation and products to continue to grow this market we provide software and support to earlystage entrepreneurs nonprofit organizations and startup companies who are designing clean technologies we are expanding these offerings based upon demand and opportunity in response to challenges posed by climate change 

internally we are investing in best practices to mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions “ghgs” and climate change risk through investments in renewable energy energy efficiency and disaster management and recovery strategies in fiscal year 2022 we deployed a new sustainability financing framework to accelerate new and existing efforts in these areas details about this effort can be found in our sustainability financing framework on our website at wwwautodeskcom information contained on or accessible through our website is not part of or incorporated by reference into this report 

emissions performance  other key performance indicators 

in fiscal year 2022 we launched our second sciencebased ghg reduction target to reduce scope 1 and scope 2 ghgs 50 and reduce scope 3 ghgs per dollar of gross profit 25 by fiscal year 2031 compared to fiscal year 2020 

in fiscal year 2021 we attained our ongoing commitment to being netzero emissions and before carbon offsets were responsible for 126000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent across our operational marketbased boundary this represents a 45 reduction compared to our fiscal year 2020 base line our assured results for fiscal year 2022 and our ongoing commitments will be published in our fiscal year 2022 impact report this change in ghgs largely stemmed from changes in travel during the global pandemic and also continued investment in renewable energy and efficiency across our footprint areas more information about our sustainability commitment can be found in our annual impact reports which we have published on our website since 2008 our fiscal 2022 impact report will be published in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 

philanthropy 

the autodesk foundation the “foundation” a privately funded 501c3 charity organization established and solely funded by us leads our philanthropic efforts the purpose of the foundation is twofold to support employees to create a better world at work at home and in the community by matching employees’ volunteer time andor donations to nonprofit organizations and to support organizations and individuals using design to drive positive social and environmental impact in the latter case we use grant funding software donations and training to accomplish this goal selecting the most impactful and innovative organizations around the world thus leading to a better future for our planet on our behalf the foundation also administers a discounted software donation program to nonprofit organizations social and environmental entrepreneurs and others who are developing design solutions that will shape a more sustainable future during fiscal 2020 autodesk committed to target 1 of annual operating margin for the longterm support of the autodesk foundation

developer programs 

our business and our customers benefit from our relationships with an extensive developer network these developers create and sell their own interoperable products that further enhance the range of integrated solutions available to our customers one of our key strategies is to maintain an openarchitecture design of our software products to facilitate thirdparty development of complementary products and industryspecific software solutions this approach enables customers and third parties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses we offer several programs that provide strategic investment funding technological platforms user communities technical support forums and events to developers who develop addon applications for our products for example we created a web services platform autodesk forge which includes web services that enable software developers to rapidly develop the next generation of applications and experiences that will power the future of making things forge facilitates the development of a single connected ecosystem for integrating autodesk applications with other enterprise web and mobile solutions 

competition 

the markets for our products are highly competitive are subject to rapid change and can have complex interdependencies between many of the larger businesses we strive to increase our competitive separation by investing in research and development allowing us to bring new products to market and create exciting new versions of existing products that offer compelling efficiencies for our customers we also compete through investments in marketing and sales to more effectively reach new customers and better serve existing customers 

our competitors include large global publicly traded companies small geographically focused firms startup firms and solutions produced inhouse by their users our primary global competitors include adobe systems incorporated aveva group plc bentley systems inc dassault systèmes sa and its subsidiary dassault systèmes solidworks corp intergraph corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of hexagon ab msc software corporation nemetschek ag oracle corporation procore technologies inc ptc inc 3d systems corporation siemens plm and trimble navigation limited among others 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing power with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the industry continues to undergo a platform shift from the personal computer to cloud and mobile computing this shift further lowers barriers to entry and poses a disruptive challenge to established software companies the design software market is characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete both from existing competitors and by entry of new competitors with innovative technologies competition is increasingly enhanced by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies and the possibility that competitors in one vertical segment may enter other vertical segments that we serve in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources than we do because of these and other factors competitive conditions in these industries are likely to continue to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which could harm our business see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion of risks regarding competition 

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to better serve customers by offering new products including cloud and mobile computing products whether by internal development or acquisition and to continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to ease of use reliability performance range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation price and training 

intellectual property and licenses 

we maintain an active program to legally protect our investment in technology through intellectual property rights we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions the nature and extent of legal protection associated with each such intellectual property right depends on among other things the type of intellectual property right and the given jurisdiction in which such right arises we believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business 

nonetheless our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws and enforcement of the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws enforcement of intellectual 

table of contents 

property rights against alleged infringers can sometimes lead to costly litigation and counterclaims our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business 

from time to time we receive claims alleging infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights including patents disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to among other things costly litigation or product shipment delays which could harm our business 

we retain ownership of software we develop our combined hybrid offerings include both desktop software and cloud functionality desktop software is licensed to users pursuant to ‘click through’ or signed license agreements containing restrictions on duplication disclosure and transfer cloud software and associated services are provided to users pursuant to online or signed terms of service agreements containing restrictions on access and use 

we believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our intellectual property and the rapid ongoing technological changes in both the computer hardware and software industries we must rely principally upon software engineering and marketing skills to continually maintain and enhance our competitive market position 

while we have recovered some revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of our software solutions we are unable to measure the full extent to which unauthorized use of our software products exists we believe however that unauthorized use of our software is and can be expected to be a persistent problem that negatively impacts our revenue and financial results we believe that our transition from perpetual use software licenses to a subscriptionbased business model combined with the change from desktop to cloudbased computing will shift the incentives and means by which software is used without authorization 

in addition through various licensing arrangements we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others we expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing arrangements in the future as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions to support continued development and sales of our products and services some of these licensing arrangements require or may require royalty payments and other licensing fees the amount of these payments and fees may depend on various factors including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments offsetting considerations if any and the degree of use of the licensed technology 

see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion of risks related to protecting our intellectual property 

production and suppliers 

the production of our software products and services involves duplication or hosting of software media the way that we deliver software has evolved during our business model transition for certain cloudbased products we use a combination of colocated hosting facilities and increasingly amazon web services and to a lesser degree other infrastructureasaservice providers we offer customers an electronic software download option for both initial product fulfillment and subsequent product updates customers who choose electronic fulfillment receive the latest version of the software from our vendor’s secure servers customers may also obtain our software through media such as dvds and usb flash drives available from multiple sources the purchase of media and the transfer of the software programs onto media for distribution to customers are performed by us and by licensed subcontractors packaging materials are produced to our specifications by outside sources production is performed in leased facilities operated by independent thirdparty contractors to date we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the production of our software and documentation

talent and human capital management 

our employees play a central role in the success of our longterm strategy autodesk’s culture code defines values and behaviors that support our commitment to being a customer company where each employee takes responsibility for understanding our customers’ needs expectations and experiences as of january 31 2022 we employed approximately 12600 people an increase from approximately 11500 employees as of the end of fiscal year 2021 none of our employees in the united states are represented by a labor union in certain foreign countries our employees are represented by trade unions or work councils we have never experienced any work stoppages and believe our employee relations are strong reliance upon employees in other countries entails various risks and changes in these foreign countries such as government instability or regulation unfavorable to foreignowned businesses which could negatively impact our business in the future 

diversity and belonging 

autodesk is committed to building and maintaining a diverse workforce and a culture of belonging that welcomes people from all backgrounds perspectives and beliefs we have developed and embedded a holistic global diversity and belonging “db” strategy into all that we do our db strategy includes a variety of activities such as inclusive leadership training for all people managers and senior employees hiring manager and interview classes that include training on mitigating bias and inclusive practices culture sprints for all employees to foster belonging and a db speaker series featuring leaders from a range of disciplines 

to help us build a more diverse workforce we have continued to invest in our diversity partnerships we partner with educational institutions such as hispanicserving institutions and historically black colleges and universities and professional organizations around the globe supporting underrepresented groups in technology we provide a variety of scholarships internship programs mentoring and development partnerships and program support to organizations focused on women and underrepresented groups 

we also have an emerging leaders program which is focused on developing a diverse cohort of leaders through professional development mentoring and networking opportunities in addition we provide ongoing development opportunities such as the autodesk mentorship program which provides oneonone mentorship relationships autodesk has seven employee resource groups “ergs” which are employeeled groups that bring employees together based on common backgrounds or diversity characteristics to foster a sense of belonging and connection

risks relating to our business and strategy 

our strategy to develop and introduce new products and services exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance costs related to product defects and large expenditures each of which may result in no additional net revenue or decreased net revenue 

the software industry is characterized by rapid technological changes as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences in recent years the industry has undergone a transition from developing and selling perpetual licenses and onpremises products to subscriptions and cloudenabled technologies customers are also reconsidering how they purchase software products which requires us to constantly evaluate our business model and strategy in response we are focused on providing solutions to enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative on their projects we devote significant resources to the development of new technologies in addition we frequently introduce new business models or methods that require a considerable investment of technical and financial resources such as our introduction of flexible subscription and service offerings and our transition of multisubscription plans to nameduser plans it is uncertain whether these strategies including our product and pricing changes will accurately reflect customer demand or be successful or whether we will be able to develop the necessary infrastructure and business models more quickly than our competitors we make such investments through further development and enhancement of our existing products and services as well as through acquisitions such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs and could result in decreased net revenue or profitability if we are not able to meet customer requirements either with respect to our software or the manner in which we provide such products or if we are not able to adapt our business model to meet our customers’ requirements our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted 

in particular a critical component of our growth strategy is to have customers of our autocad and autocad lt products as well as other individual autodesk products expand their portfolios to include our other offerings and cloudbased functionality and we are taking steps to accelerate this migration at times sales of our autocad and autocad lt or individual autodesk flagship products have decreased without a corresponding increase in industry collections or cloudbased functionality revenue or without purchases of customer seats to our industry collections should this continue our results of operations will be adversely affected 

our executive management team must continuously act quickly and with vision given the rapidly changing customer expectations and technology advancements inherent in the software industry the extensive and complex efforts required to create useful and widely accepted products and the rapid evolution of cloud computing mobile devices new computing platforms and other technologies such as consumer products although we have articulated a strategy that we believe will fulfill these challenges if we fail to execute properly on that strategy or adapt the strategy as market conditions evolve we may fail to meet our customers’ expectations be unable to compete with our competitors products and technology and lose the confidence of our channel partners and employees this in turn could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

the effects of the covid19 pandemic and related public health measures have affected how we and our customers are operating our respective businesses and the extent of the impact on our business and results of operations remains uncertain  

we are continuing to conduct business during the covid19 pandemic with substantial modifications to employee travel and work locations as well as virtualization postponement or cancellation of certain sales and marketing events among other changes we have observed other companies as well as governments taking precautionary measures to address covid19 while government authorities in some geographies are removing covid19 related business operations restrictions we continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions to alter our business operations as may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners suppliers and stockholders including in response to outbreaks and variants the extent of the impact of any such modifications on our business including the effects on our customers and prospects and on our financial results remains uncertain 

we will continue to invest in critical areas such as research and development construction and digitizing the company to support our future success as we come out of the pandemic if we are not able to successfully manage our spending and investment it could have a material adverse effect on our cash balances business and results of operations 

although recent vaccine approvals and rollouts have raised hopes of a turnaround in the covid19 pandemic renewed waves and new variants as well as delays in vaccinations pose risks to recovery and our outlook in addition supply chain disruption and resulting inflationary pressures a global labor shortage and the ebb and flow of covid19 including in specific geographies are currently impacting the pace of our recovery and our outlook growth may slow if virus outbreaks 

table of contents 

including from new variants prove difficult to contain infections and deaths mount rapidly before vaccines are widely available and social distancing measures andor lockdowns return and are more stringent than anticipated moreover if economic policy support is insufficient or withdrawn before full economic recovery bankruptcies of viable but illiquid companies could mount leading to further or renewed employment and income losses and a more protracted recovery together these uncertainties and risks could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition business and results of operations 

global economic and political conditions may further impact our industries business and financial results 

our overall performance depends largely upon domestic and worldwide economic and political conditions the united states and other countries’ economies have experienced cyclical downturns in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services restricted credit poor liquidity decreased government spending reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets bankruptcies and overall uncertainty these economic conditions can occur abruptly for example the coronavirus covid19 pandemic has caused additional uncertainty in the global economy and an economic downturn or recession in the united states or in other countries may occur or has already occurred and may continue the extent to which covid19 will impact our financial condition or results of operations is still uncertain and will continue to depend on developments such as the impact on our customers vendors distributors and resellers such as the supply chain disruption and resulting inflationary pressures and global labor shortage that we have seen recently as well as other factors including the full duration and the extent of the pandemic including as a result of outbreaks and variants actions taken by governments businesses and consumers in response to the pandemic speed and timing of economic recovery including in specific geographies speed of rollout of covid19 vaccines lifting of restrictions on movement and normalization of fulltime return to work and social events our billings and renewal rates including new business close rates rate of multiyear contracts pace of closing larger transactions and new unit volume growth and effect of the pandemic on margins and cash flow all of these factors continue to evolve and remain uncertain at this time and some of these factors are not within our control due to our subscriptionbased business model the effect of covid19 may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods if at all if economic growth in countries where we do business slows or if such countries experience further economic recessions customers may delay or reduce technology purchases which we have seen recently in certain countries including china our customers include government entities including the us federal government and if spending cuts impede the ability of governments to purchase our products and services our revenue could decline in addition a number of our customers rely directly and indirectly on government spending 

as described elsewhere in these risk factors we are dependent on international revenue and operations and are subject to related risks of conducting business globally trends toward nationalism and protectionism and the weakening or dissolution of international trade pacts may increase the cost of or otherwise interfere with conducting business these trends have increased political and economic unpredictability globally and may increase the volatility of global financial markets and the impact of such developments on the global economy remains uncertain political instability or adverse political developments in any of the countries in which we do business could harm our business results of operations and financial condition a financial sector credit crisis could impair credit availability and the financial stability of our customers including our distribution partners and channels a disruption in the financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking partners on which we rely for operating cash management war including the significant military action against ukraine launched by russia and any related political or economic responses and counterresponses or otherwise by various global actors or the general effect on the global economy could also affect our business any of these events could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business could be adversely impacted by the costs and challenges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments 

we regularly acquire or invest in businesses software solutions and technologies that are complementary to our business through acquisitions strategic alliances or equity or debt investments including several transactions in fiscal 2022 the risks associated with such acquisitions include the difficulty of integrating solutions operations and personnel inheriting liabilities such as intellectual property infringement claims failure to realize anticipated revenue and cost projections and expected synergies the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business in accordance with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and diversion of managements time and attention in addition such acquisitions and investments involve other risks such as 

• the inability to retain customers key employees vendors distributors business partners and other entities associated with the acquired business 

• the potential that due diligence of the acquired business or solution does not identify significant problems 

• exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of an acquisition including claims from terminated employees customers or other third parties 

table of contents 

• the potential for incompatible business cultures 

• significantly higher than anticipated transaction or integrationrelated costs 

• potential additional exposure to economic tax currency political legal and regulatory risks associated with specific countries and 

• the potential impact on relationships with existing customers vendors and distributors as business partners as a result of acquiring another business 

we may not be successful in overcoming such risks and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business in addition if we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the extent anticipated acquisitions and investments have in the past and may in the future contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly financial results these fluctuations could arise from transactionrelated costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or writeoffs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments and could negatively impact our financial results 

we are dependent on international revenue and operations exposing us to significant international regulatory economic intellectual property collections currency exchange rate taxation political and other risks which could adversely impact our financial results 

international net revenue represented 67 and 66 of our net revenue for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively our international revenue some of which comes from emerging economies is subject to economic and political conditions in foreign markets including those resulting from economic and political conditions in the united states as well as countryspecific conditions related to covid19 such as varied speed of recovery in different geographies for example we have recently seen a deceleration in growth in certain geographies including china our total revenue is also impacted by the relative geographical and country mix of our revenue over time our dependency on international revenue makes us much more exposed to global economic and political trends which can negatively impact our financial results even if our results in the united states are strong for a particular period 

we anticipate that our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue and as we expand our international development sales and marketing expertise will provide significant support to our overall efforts in countries outside of the united states risks inherent in our international operations include 

• economic volatility 

• tariffs quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions  including any political or economic responses and counterresponses or otherwise by various global actors to the significant military action against ukraine launched by russia 

• fluctuating currency exchange rates including devaluations currency controls and inflation and risks related to any hedging activities we undertake 

• changes in regulatory requirements and practices 

• delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology 

• different purchase patterns as compared to the developed world 

• operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices particularly in emerging economies 

• compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other anticorruption laws 

• difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales and development operations 

• local competition 

• longer collection cycles for accounts receivable 

• us and foreign tax law changes and the complexities of tax reporting 

• laws regarding the free flow of data across international borders and management of and access to data and public networks 

• possible future limitations upon foreignowned businesses 

• increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities 

table of contents 

• inadequate local infrastructure 

• greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property 

• software piracy and 

• other factors beyond our control including popular uprisings terrorism war including the significant military action against ukraine launched by russia and any related political or economic responses and counterresponses or otherwise by various global actors or the general effect on the global economy natural disasters and diseases and pandemics such as covid19 

some of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above 

the application of the trade and cooperation agreement between the european union the european atomic energy community and the united kingdom signed in december 2020 the “tca” which took effect january 1 2021 could have adverse tax tax treaty banking operational legal regulatory or other impacts on our businesses in the region the withdrawal could also among other potential outcomes create currency volatility disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and significantly disrupt trade between the united kingdom and the european union and other parties uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the united kingdom economy the european union economies and the other economies in which we operate 

in addition in recent years the united states has instituted or proposed changes to foreign trade policy including the negotiation or termination of trade agreements the imposition of tariffs on products imported from certain countries economic sanctions on individuals corporations or countries and other government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries in which we do business more recently the united states and other global actors have imposed sanctions as a result of the significant military action against ukraine launched by russia new or increased tariffs and other changes in us trade policy including sanctions could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries including russia and certain foreign governments including the chinese government have instituted or considered imposing trade sanctions on certain usmanufactured goods the escalation of protectionist or retaliatory trade measures in either the united states or any other countries in which we do business such as announcing sanctions a change in tariff structures export compliance or other trade policies may increase the cost of or otherwise interfere with the conduct of our business broadbased sanctions against russia should they be implemented could have a material adverse effect on our operations and business outlook 

furthermore in response to the russian invasion of ukraine effective early march 2022 we have suspended all new business in russia our revenue in fiscal 2022 generated in russia was less than 2 of total revenue we continue to evaluate our business operations there including whether and how to support existing customers 

even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks 

we may not be able to predict subscription renewal rates and their impact on our future revenue and operating results 

our customers are not obligated to renew their subscriptions for our offerings and they may elect not to renew upgrade or expand their subscriptions we cannot assure renewal rates or the mix of subscriptions renewals customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate due to a number of factors including offering pricing competitive offerings customer satisfaction and reductions in customer spending levels customer activity or number of users due to economic downturns including as a result of the current covid19 pandemic or financial markets uncertainty if our customers do not renew their subscriptions or if they renew on less favorable terms our revenues may decline 

existing and increased competition and rapidly evolving technological changes may reduce our revenue and profits 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing devices with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the industry has undergone a transition from developing and selling perpetual licenses and onpremises products to subscriptions and cloudenabled technologies  this shift further lowers barriers to entry and poses a disruptive challenge to established software companies the markets in which we operate are characterized by vigorous competition both by entrants with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary offerings and technologies some of our competitors have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources furthermore a reduction in the number and availability of compatible thirdparty applications or our inability to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes including those related to cloud computing mobile devices and new computing platforms may adversely affect the sale of our solutions because of these and other 

table of contents 

factors competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which would likely harm our business 

our financial results key metrics and other operating metrics fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenue and financial results difficult to predict 

our quarterly financial results key metrics and other operating metrics have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so in the future these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines we also provide investors with quarterly and annual financial forwardlooking guidance that could prove to be inaccurate as a result of these fluctuations in addition to the other risks described in these risk factors some of the factors that could cause our financial results key metrics and other operating metrics to fluctuate include 

• general market economic business and political conditions in europe apac and emerging economies including from an economic downturn or recession in the united states or other countries 

• failure to produce sufficient revenue billings subscription profitability and cash flow growth including as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

• failure to accurately predict the impact of acquired businesses or to identify and realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions and successfully integrate such acquired businesses and technologies 

• potential goodwill impairment charges related to prior acquisitions 

• failure to manage spend 

• changes in billings linearity 

• changes in subscription mix pricing pressure or changes in subscription pricing 

• weak or negative growth in one or more of the industries we serve including aec manufacturing and digital media and entertainment markets 

• the success of new business or sales initiatives 

• security breaches related reputational harm and potential financial penalties to customers and government entities 

• restructuring or other accounting charges and unexpected costs or other operating expenses 

• timing of additional investments in our technologies or deployment of our services 

• changes in revenue recognition or other accounting guidelines employed by us andor established by the financial accounting standards board securities and exchange commission or other rulemaking bodies 

• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and the effectiveness of our hedging activity 

• dependence on and timing of large transactions 

• adjustments arising from ongoing or future tax examinations 

• the ability of governments around the world to adopt fiscal policies meet their financial and debt obligations and finance infrastructure projects 

• failure to expand our autocad and autocad lt customer base to related design products and services 

• our ability to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes including those related to cloud computing mobile devices and new computing platforms 

• timing of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors 

• the financial and business condition of our reseller and distribution channels 

• perceived or actual technical or other problems with a product or combination of subscriptions 

• unexpected or negative outcomes of matters and expenses relating to litigation or regulatory inquiries 

• increases in cloud functionalityrelated expenses 

• timing of releases and retirements of offerings 

• changes in tax laws or tax or accounting rules and regulations such as increased use of fair value measures 

table of contents 

• changes in sales compensation practices 

• failure to effectively implement and maintain our copyright legalization programs especially in developing countries 

• renegotiation or termination of royalty or intellectual property arrangements 

• interruptions or terminations in the business of our consultants or thirdparty developers 

• timing and degree of expected investments in growth and efficiency opportunities 

• failure to achieve continued success in technology advancements 

• catastrophic events natural disasters or public health events such as pandemics and epidemics including covid19 

• regulatory compliance costs and 

• failure to appropriately estimate the scope of services under consulting arrangements 

we have also experienced fluctuations in financial results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic or political conditions in particular our financial results in europe during our third quarter are usually affected by a slower summer period and our apac operations typically experience seasonal slowing in our third and fourth quarters war including the significant military action against ukraine launched by russia and any related political or economic responses and counterresponses or otherwise by various global actors or the general effect on the global economy could also affect our business 

our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenue and are relatively fixed in the short term accordingly any revenue shortfall below expectations has had and in the future could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability greater than anticipated expenses or a failure to maintain rigorous cost controls would also negatively affect profitability 

we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from a small number of solutions including our autocadbased software products and collections and if these offerings are not successful our revenue would be adversely affected 

we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from sales of subscriptions of a limited number of our offerings including autocad software solutions based on autocad which include our collections that serve specific markets and products that are interoperable with autocad any factor adversely affecting sales of these subscriptions including the product release cycle market acceptance product competition performance and reliability reputation price competition economic and market conditions and the availability of thirdparty applications would likely harm our financial results during both fiscal 2022 and 2021 combined revenue from our autocad and autocad lt family products not including collections having autocad or autocad lt as a component represented 29 of our total net revenue 

from time to time we realign or introduce new business and sales initiatives if we fail to successfully execute and manage these initiatives our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

as part of our effort to accommodate our customers’ needs and demands and the rapid evolution of technology from time to time we evolve our business and sales initiatives such as realigning our development and marketing organizations offering software as a service and realigning our internal resources in an effort to improve efficiency we may take such actions without clear indications that they will prove successful and at times we have been met with shortterm challenges in the execution of such initiatives market acceptance of any new business or sales initiative is dependent on our ability to match our customers’ needs at the right time and price often we have limited prior experience and operating history in these new areas of emphasis if any of our assumptions about expenses revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated and our financial results will be negatively impacted 

net revenue billings earnings cash flow or subscriptions shortfalls or volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline 

the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including the other risks described in these risk factors and the following 

table of contents 

• shortfalls in our expected financial results including net revenue billings earnings and cash flow or key performance metrics such as subscriptions including as a result of the current covid19 pandemic and how those results compare to securities analyst expectations including whether those results fail to meet exceed or significantly exceed securities analyst expectations 

• quarterly variations in our or our competitors’ results of operations 

• general socioeconomic political or market conditions including from an economic downturn or recession in the united states or in other countries 

• changes in forwardlooking estimates of future results how those estimates compare to securities analyst expectations or changes in recommendations or confusion on the part of analysts and investors about the short and longterm impact to our business 

• uncertainty about certain governments’ abilities to repay debt or effect fiscal policy 

• announcements of new offerings or enhancements by us or our competitors 

• unusual events such as significant acquisitions divestitures regulatory actions and litigation 

• changes in laws rules or regulations applicable to our business 

• outstanding debt service obligations and 

• other factors including factors unrelated to our operating performance such as instability affecting the economy or the operating performance of our competitors 

significant changes in the price of our common stock could expose us to costly and timeconsuming litigation historically after periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities a company becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management’s attention and resources 

as a result of our strategy of partnering with other companies for product development our product delivery schedules could be adversely affected if we experience difficulties with our product development partners 

we partner with certain independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities we believe our partnering strategy allows us to achieve efficiencies in developing new products and maintaining and enhancing existing product offerings this strategy creates a dependency on independent developers independent developers including those who currently develop solutions for us in the united states and throughout the world may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future in addition use of development resources through consulting relationships particularly in nonus jurisdictions with developing legal systems may be adversely impacted by and expose us to risks relating to evolving employment export and intellectual property laws these risks could among other things expose our intellectual property to misappropriation and result in disruptions to product delivery schedules 

social and ethical issues relating to the use of artificial intelligence in our offerings may result in reputational harm or liability 

social and ethical issues relating to the use of new and evolving technologies such as artificial intelligence “ai” in our offerings may result in reputational harm and liability and may cause us to incur additional research and development costs to resolve such issues we are increasingly building ai into many of our offerings as with many innovations ai presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption and therefore our business ai presents emerging ethical issues and if we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society we may experience brand or reputational harm competitive harm or legal liability potential government regulation in the space of ai ethics may also increase the burden and cost of research and development in this area subjecting us to brand or reputational harm competitive harm or legal liability failure to address ai ethics issues by us or others in our industry could undermine public confidence in ai and slow adoption of ai in our products and services 

risks relating to our operations 

security incidents may compromise the integrity of our or our customers’ systems solutions offerings services applications data or intellectual property harm our reputation damage our competitiveness create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results 

as we digitize autodesk and use cloud and webbased technologies to leverage customer data to deliver the total customer experience we are exposed to increased security risks and the potential for unauthorized access to or improper use of 

table of contents 

our and our customers’ information like other software offerings and systems ours are vulnerable to security incidents including those from acquired companies also our ability to mitigate the security incident risk may be impacted by our limited control over our customers or thirdparty technology providers and vendors or the processing of data by thirdparty technology providers and vendors which may not allow us to maintain the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing we devote significant resources in an effort to maintain the security and integrity of our systems offerings services and applications online mobile and desktop including by enhancing security features conducting penetration tests code hardening releasing security vulnerability updates and accelerating our incident response time we also provide annual information security training to our employees despite these efforts we may not prevent security incidents and we may face delays or other difficulties in identifying responding to or remediating security incidents 

hackers regularly have targeted our systems offerings services and applications and we expect them to do so in the future to date such identified security events have not been material or significant to us or our customers including to our reputation or business operations or had a material financial impact but there can be no assurance that future cyberattacks will not be material or significant security incidents could disrupt the proper functioning of our systems solutions offerings applications or services cause errors in the output of our customers’ work allow unauthorized access to or unauthorized use disclosure modification loss or destruction of sensitive data or intellectual property including proprietary or confidential information of ours or our customers or cause other destructive outcomes the risk of a security incident particularly through cyberattack or cyber intrusion including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyber terrorists has increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased these threats include identity theft unauthorized access dns attacks wireless network attacks viruses and worms malware bugs vulnerabilities advanced persistent threats apt applicationcentric attacks peertopeer attacks social engineering phishing credential stuffing malicious file uploads backdoor trojans supply chain attacks ransomware attacks and distributed denial of service ddos attacks in addition third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees vendors partners customers or users to disclose information to gain access to our data or our customers’ or users’ data and there is the risk of employee contractor or vendor error or malfeasance these existing risks are compounded given the covid19 pandemic and the resulting shift to workfromhome arrangements for a large population of employees and contractors as well as employees and contractors of our thirdparty technology providers and vendors and the risks could also be elevated in connection with the russian invasion of ukraine despite our significant efforts to create security barriers to such threats we cannot entirely mitigate these risks and there is no guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure of such information will not occur or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to such information 

many governments have enacted laws requiring companies to provide notice of security incidents involving certain types of personal data and personal information we are also contractually required to notify certain customers of certain security incidents if any of the foregoing security incidents were to occur or to be perceived to have occurred our reputation may suffer our competitive position may be diminished customers may stop paying for our solutions and services we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to evaluate and alleviate the security incident and to try to prevent further or additional incidents and we could face regulatory inquiry lawsuits and potential liability we could incur significant costs and liabilities including due to litigation indemnity obligations damages for contract breach penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations and costs for remediation and other incentives offered to customers or other business partners in an effort to maintain business relationships after a security incident and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

we cannot assure you that any limitations of liability provisions in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim relating to a security incident we also cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims related to a security incident or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business including our financial condition operating results and reputation 

our use of thirdparty open source software could negatively affect our ability to sell subscriptions to access our products and subject us to possible litigation and greater security risks 

we use thirdparty open source software from time to time companies that use thirdparty open source software have faced claims challenging the use of such open source software and compliance with the open source software license terms accordingly we may be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming noncompliance with the applicable open source licensing terms some open source software licenses require end 

table of contents 

users who distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open source software to make publicly available or to license all or part of such software which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code such as modifications or derivative works created based upon incorporating or using the open source software under the terms of the particular open source license while we employ practices designed to monitor our compliance with the licenses of thirdparty open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code we may inadvertently use thirdparty open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of noncompliance with the terms of the applicable license including claims of intellectual property rights infringement or for breach of contract furthermore there exists today an increasing number of types of open source software licenses almost none of which have been tested in courts of law to provide clarity on their proper legal interpretation if we were to receive a claim of noncompliance with the terms of any of these open source licenses we may be required to publicly release certain portions of our proprietary source code we could also be required to expend substantial time and resources to reengineer some or all of our software any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in addition the use of thirdparty open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of thirdparty commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the functionality or origin of the software use of open source software may also present additional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our platform any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and could help our competitors develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours 

we rely on third parties to provide us with a number of operational and technical services thirdparty security incidents could result in the loss of our or our customers’ data expose us to liability harm our reputation damage our competitiveness and adversely impact our financial results 

we rely on third parties such as amazon web services to provide us with operational and technical services these third parties may have access to our systems provide hosting services or otherwise process data about us or our customers employees or partners our ability to monitor such third parties’ security measures is limited there have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks and we cannot guarantee that our or our such third parties’ systems have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects bugs or vulnerabilities that could result in an incident breach or other disruption to our or these third parties’ systems any security incident involving such third parties could compromise the integrity or availability of or result in the theft of our and our customers’ data in addition our operations or the operations of our customers or partners could be negatively affected in the event of a security incident and could be subject to the loss or theft of confidential or proprietary information including source code unauthorized access to data and other confidential or proprietary information may be obtained through breakins network breaches by unauthorized parties employee theft or misuse or other misconduct if any of the foregoing were to occur or to be perceived to occur our reputation may suffer our competitive position may be diminished customers may buy fewer of our offerings and services we could face lawsuits regulatory investigation fines and potential liability and our financial results could be negatively impacted 

delays in service from thirdparty service providers could expose us to liability harm our reputation damage our competitiveness and adversely impact our financial results 

from time to time we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country for the provision of services and materials that we use in the operation of our business and production of our solutions inability of such third parties to satisfy our requirements could disrupt our operations or make it more difficult for us to implement our strategy if any of these situations were to occur our reputation could be harmed we could be subject to thirdparty liability including under data protection and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions and our financial results could be negatively impacted 

we are investing in resources to update and improve our information technology systems to digitize autodesk and support our customers should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing information technology systems disrupt our operations our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network and data center infrastructure technology systems and websites for our development marketing operational support sales accounting and financial reporting activities we continually invest resources to update and improve these systems to meet the evolving requirements of our business and customers in particular our transition to cloudbased products and a subscriptiononly business model involves considerable investment in the development of technologies as well as backoffice systems for technical financial compliance and sales resources such improvements are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or may uncover problems with those systems unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements

could result in disruption in our business operations loss of customers loss of revenue errors in our accounting and financial reporting or damage to our reputation all of which could harm our business 

our software is highly complex and may contain undetected errors defects or vulnerabilities each of which could harm our business and financial performance 

the software solutions that we offer are complex and despite extensive testing and quality control may contain errors defects or vulnerabilities some errors defects or vulnerabilities in our software solutions may only be discovered after they have been released any errors defects or vulnerabilities could result in the need for corrective releases to our software solutions damage to our reputation loss of revenue an increase in subscription cancellations or lack of market acceptance of our offerings any of which would likely harm our business and financial performance 

if we do not maintain good relationships with the members of our distribution channel or if our distribution channel suffers financial losses becomes financially unstable or insolvent or is not provided the right mix of incentives to sell our subscriptions our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected 

we sell our software products both directly to end users and through a network of distributors and resellers for fiscal 2022 and 2021 approximately 65 and 69 respectively of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the near future our ability to effectively distribute our solutions depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller network computer software distributors and resellers typically are not highly capitalized and have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction as well as during the past several years we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of distributors and resellers prior to our sales to them in the past we have taken steps to support them and may take additional steps in the future such as extending credit terms and adjusting our incentives these steps if taken could harm our financial results if our distributors and resellers were to become insolvent they would not be able to maintain their business and sales or provide customer support services which would negatively impact our business and revenue 

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including the distributors tech data and ingram micro tech data accounted for 36 and 37 of our total net revenue for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively and ingram micro accounted for 9 and 10 of our total net revenue for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively should any of our agreements with tech data or ingram micro be terminated we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data or ingram micro would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue consequently we believe our business is not substantially dependent on either tech data or ingram micro however if either distributor were to experience a significant business disruption or if our relationship with either were to significantly deteriorate it is possible that our ability to sell to end users would at least temporarily be negatively impacted this could in turn negatively impact our financial results for example in june 2020 an affiliate of funds managed by affiliates of apollo global management a global alternative investment manager acquired tech data and in july 2021 platinum equity a global investment firm acquired ingram micro from hna technology co ltd if there is any reseller or end user uncertainty caused by either acquisition our ability to sell to these resellers and end users could at least temporarily be negatively impacted 

over time we have modified and will continue to modify aspects of our relationship with our distributors and resellers such as their incentive programs pricing to them and our distribution model to motivate and reward them for aligning their businesses with our strategy and business objectives changes in these relationships and underlying programs could negatively impact their business and harm our business further our distributors and resellers may lose confidence in our business move to competitive products or not have the skills or ability to support customers the loss of or a significant reduction in business with those distributors or resellers could harm our business in particular if one or more of such distributors or resellers were unable to meet their obligations with respect to accounts payable to us we could be forced to write off such accounts and may be required to delay the recognition of revenue on future sales to these customers these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we rely on software from third parties and a failure to properly manage our use of thirdparty software could result in increased costs or loss of revenue 

many of our products are designed to include software licensed from third parties such thirdparty software includes software licensed from commercial suppliers and under public open source licenses while we have internal processes to 

table of contents 

manage our use of such thirdparty software if such processes are inadequate we may be subject to copyright infringement or other thirdparty claims if we are noncompliant with a license for commercial software we may be required to pay penalties or undergo costly audits pursuant to the license agreement in the case of opensource software licensed under certain “copyleft” licenses the license itself or a courtimposed remedy for noncompliant use of the open source software may require that proprietary portions of our own software be publicly disclosed or licensed this could result in a loss of intellectual property rights increased costs reengineering of our software damage to our reputation or loss of revenue 

in addition to risks related to license requirements usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties support indemnities assurances of title or controls on origin of the software or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code likewise some open source projects have known security and other vulnerabilities and architectural instabilities or are otherwise subject to security attacks due to their wide availability and are provided on an “asis” basis 

our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our success and ability to invest and grow depend largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical professional managerial sales and marketing personnel historically competition for these key personnel has been intense the loss of services of any of our key personnel including key personnel joining our company through acquisitions inability to retain and attract qualified employees in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions and financial goals 

we rely on thirdparty technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies our solutions and service development may be delayed and our financial results negatively impacted 

we rely on certain software that we license from third parties including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our offerings to perform key functions these thirdparty software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and the software may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs or delays until equivalent software can be developed identified licensed and integrated which would likely harm our business 

disruptions in licensing relationships and with thirdparty developers could adversely impact our business 

we license certain key technologies from third parties licenses may be restricted in the term or the use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business similarly we may not be able to obtain or renew license agreements for key technology on favorable terms if at all and any failure to do so could harm our business our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with thirdparty developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn in particular markets such disruptions have in the past and would likely in the future negatively impact these thirdparty developers and end users which could harm our business 

technology created by outsourced product development whether outsourced to third parties or developed externally and transferred to us through business or technology acquisitions involves additional risks such as effective integration into existing products adequate transfer of technology knowhow and ownership and protection of transferred intellectual property 

risks relating to laws and regulations 

increasing regulatory focus on privacy data protection and information security issues and new and expanding laws may impact our business and expose us to increased liability 

our strategy to digitize autodesk involves increasing our use of cloud and webbased technologies and applications to leverage customer data to improve our offerings for the benefit of our customers to accomplish this strategy we must collect and otherwise process customer data which may include personal data and personal information of users from different jurisdictions globally we also collect and otherwise process personal data and personal information of our employees and contractors as a result federal state and global laws relating to privacy data protection and information security apply to autodesk’s personal data and personal information processing activities the scope of these laws and regulations is rapidly 

table of contents 

evolving subject to differing interpretations may be inconsistent among jurisdictions or conflict with other rules and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future we also expect that there will continue to be new laws regulations and industry standards concerning privacy data protection and information security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions globally laws such as the general data protection regulation eu 2016679 “gdpr” in the european union “eu” and the personal information protection law “pipl” in china have been enacted in addition new and emerging state laws in the united states governing privacy data protection and information security such as the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” the california privacy rights act “cpra” the virginia consumer data protection act “vcdpa” and the colorado privacy act “cpa” have been enacted these laws and regulations as well as industry selfregulatory codes create new compliance obligations and substantially expand the scope of potential liability and provide greater penalties for noncompliance for example the gdpr provides for penalties of up to €20 million or 4 of a company’s annual global revenue whichever is greater the pipl provides for penalties of up to 50 million renminbi or 5 of a companys annual revenue and disgorgement of all illegal gains whichever is greater and the ccpa provides for penalties of up to 7500 per violation these laws regulations and codes may also impact our innovation and business drivers in developing new and emerging technologies eg artificial intelligence and machine learning these requirements among others may impact demand for our offerings and force us to bear the burden of expanded obligations in our contracts 

in addition there is continued instability of international personal data transfer legal mechanisms that are complex uncertain and subject to active litigation and enforcement actions in a number of jurisdictions around the world for example on june 4 2021 the european commission published a new set of modular standard contractual clause “sccs” providing for an 18month implementation period which became effective on june 29 2021 and imposes on companies obligations relating to personal data transfers including the obligation to conduct a transfer impact assessment and depending on a party’s role in the transfer to implement additional security measures and to update internal privacy practices if we elect to rely on the new sccs for personal data transfers we may be required to expend significant time and resources to update our contractual arrangements and to comply with new obligations if we are unable to implement a valid mechanism for personal data transfers from the eu we will face increased exposure to regulatory actions substantial fines and injunctions against processing personal data from the eu 

in addition the united kingdom’s “uk” exit from the eu and ongoing developments in the uk have created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the uk data processing in the uk is now governed by the uk general data protection regulation and supplemented by other domestic data protection laws such as the uk data protection act 2018 which authorizes fines of up to £175 million or 4 of annual global revenue whichever is higher we are also exposed to potentially divergent enforcement actions for certain violations furthermore the new sccs apply only to the transfer of personal data outside the eu and not the uk although the european commission adopted an adequacy decision for the uk on june 28 2021 allowing the continued flow of personal data from the eu to the uk this decision will be regularly reviewed going forward and may be revoked if the uk diverges from its current adequate data protection laws following its exit from the eu on february 2 2022 the uk’s information commissioner’s office issued new standard contractual clauses to support personal data transfers out of the uk “uk sccs” if approved by the uk parliament the uk sccs will become effective march 21 2022 and we may in addition to other impacts experience additional costs associated with increased compliance burdens and be required to engage in new contract negotiations with third parties that aid in processing personal data on our behalf or localize certain personal data 

several other countries including china australia new zealand brazil and japan have also established specific legal requirements for crossborder data transfers there is also an increasing trend towards data localization policies for example in 2015 russia introduced data localization laws in 2021 china introduced localization requirements for certain data there are also other countries such as india that are considering data localization requirements if this trend continues and countries implement more restrictive regulations for crossborder personal data transfers or do not permit personal data to leave the country of origin our business financial condition and results of operations in those jurisdictions could be impacted 

in addition the new state laws – the cpra and the vcdpa – that become effective on january 1 2023 and the cpa that becomes effective on july 1 2023 introduce additional obligations such as data minimization and storage limitations granting additional rights to consumers such as correction of personal information and additional optout rights the cpra also creates a new agency to implement and enforce the law these new state laws will require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and may cause us to incur substantial costs and expenses in order to comply laws in all 50 states and some of our contracts require us to provide notice under certain circumstances to customers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach also if third parties we work with such as suppliers violate applicable data protection laws or regulations such violations may also put our users’ information at risk and could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects additionally in addition to government activity privacy advocacy 

table of contents 

groups and technology and other industries are considering various new additional or different selfregulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us evolving legislation and the interplay of federal and state laws may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies creating complex compliance issues and have and may cause variation in requirements increase restrictions and potential legal risk and impact strategies and the availability of previously useful data potentially exposing us to additional expense adverse publicity and liability 

in the eu and the uk regulators are increasingly focusing on compliance with requirements in the online behavioral advertising ecosystem and current national laws that implement the eprivacy directive are highly likely to be replaced by an eu regulation known as the eprivacy regulation which is expected to significantly increase fines for noncompliance while the text of the eprivacy regulation is under development recent european case law and regulators’ recent guidance are driving increased attention to cookies and tracking technologies this could lead to substantial costs require significant system changes limit the effectiveness of our marketing activities divert the attention of our technology personnel adversely affect our margins increase costs and subject us to additional liabilities regulation of cookies and similar technologies and any decline of cookies or similar online tracking technologies as a means to identify and potentially target users may lead to broader restrictions and impairments on our marketing and personalization activities and may negatively impact our efforts to understand our customers 

governments regulators plaintiffs’ attorneys privacy advocates have increased their focus on how companies collect process use store share and transmit personal data and personal information any perception of our practices products offerings or services as a violation of individual privacy or data protection rights may subject us to public criticism lawsuits reputational harm or investigations or claims by regulators industry groups or other third parties all of which could disrupt or adversely impact our business and expose us to increased liability moreover because the interpretation and application of many laws and regulations relating to privacy data protection and information security are uncertain it is possible that these laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our products offerings and services we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our offerings and services any of which could require significant additional expense and adversely affect our business including impacting our ability to innovate delaying our development roadmap and adversely affecting our relationships with customers and our ability to compete if we are obligated to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our products offerings or services we may be unable to make such changes and modifications in a commercially reasonable manner or at all and our ability to develop new products offerings and services could be limited 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls 

  

our offerings are subject to export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations that prohibit the delivery of certain solutions and services without the required export authorizations or export to locations governments and persons targeted by applicable sanctions while we have processes to prevent our offerings from being exported in violation of these laws including obtaining authorizations as appropriate and screening against us government and international lists of restricted and prohibited persons we cannot guarantee that these processes will prevent all violations of export control and sanctions laws 

  

if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm as well as other negative consequences including government investigations and penalties we presently incorporate export control and sanctions compliance requirements in our channel partner agreements complying with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities violations of applicable sanctions or export control laws can result in fines or penalties 

for additional risks regarding sanctions and trade protectionism please see the risk factor entitled “we are dependent on international revenue and operations   ” earlier in this section 

if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights our business could be harmed 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright and trademark laws trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights however the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate while we have patent applications pending in the united states and throughout the world we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications in addition any patents issued to us in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore 

table of contents 

legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties from time to time have copied or reverse engineered aspects of our software or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our software is timeconsuming and costly we are unable to measure the extent to which unauthorized use of our software exists and we expect that unauthorized use of software will remain a persistent problem particularly in emerging economies 

additionally we actively protect the secrecy of our confidential information and trade secrets including our source code if unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code unauthorized disclosure of our source code could make it easier for third parties to compete with our offerings by copying functionality which could adversely affect our financial performance and our reputation we also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of nondisclosure agreements with our employees customers contractors vendors and partners however it is possible that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization if this were to occur it may be difficult andor costly for us to enforce our rights and our financial performance and reputation could be negatively impacted 

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in the loss of significant rights 

our competitors as well as a number of other entities and individuals may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our business third parties may claim that we are infringing upon or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights even if we are unaware of the intellectual property rights claimed against us as more software patents are granted worldwide the number of offerings and competitors in our industries grows and the functionality of products in different industries overlaps we expect that software developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims additionally certain patent assertion entities have become more aggressive in threatening and pursuing litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents 

any claims or threats of infringement or misappropriation whether with or without merit have been and could in the future be timeconsuming to defend result in costly litigation and diversion of resources cause product delays require us to change our products or business practices prevent us from offering our software and services or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in addition such royalty or license agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms if at all which would likely harm our business we may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners or pay substantial settlement costs including royalty payments in connection with any such claim or litigation and to obtain licenses modify applications or refund fees which could be costly furthermore from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products including in areas where we historically have not competed which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims 

contracting with government entities exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government procurement process 

we provide products and services directly and indirectly to a variety of government entities risks associated with licensing and selling products and services to government entities include extended sales and collection cycles varying governmental budgeting processes and adherence to complex procurement regulations and other governmentspecific contractual requirements we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business as well as harm to our reputation and financial results 

risks relating to financial developments 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our cash flow revenue and expense exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as part of our risk management strategy we use foreign currency contracts to manage a portion of our exposures of underlying assets liabilities and other obligations which exist as part of our ongoing business operations these foreign currency instruments may have maturities that extend for one to 18 months in the future and provide us with some protection against currency exposures however our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be completely successful resulting in an adverse impact on our financial results 

table of contents 

the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given period although our foreign currency cash flow hedge program extends beyond the current quarter in order to reduce our exposure to foreign currency volatility we do not attempt to completely mitigate this risk and in any case will incur transaction fees in adopting such hedging programs such volatility even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings 

in addition global events including the sudden and unexpected effects of the covid19 pandemic as well as geopolitical developments may contribute to volatility in foreign exchange markets which we may not be able to effectively manage and our financial results could be adversely impacted additionally countries in which we operate may be classified as highly inflationary economies requiring special accounting and financial reporting treatment for such operations or such countries’ currencies may be devalued or both which may adversely impact our business operations and financial results 

our debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations 

we have 265 billion of principal debt consisting of notes due at various times from december 2022 to december 2031 as described in part 2 item 8 we also entered into a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of 15 billion with an option to be increased up to 20 billion as described in part 2 item 8 maintenance of our indebtedness contractual restrictions and additional issuances of indebtedness could 

• cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; 

• increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic industry and competitive conditions 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry 

• impair our ability to obtain future financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions general corporate or other purposes; and 

• due to limitations within the debt instruments restrict our ability to grant liens on property enter into certain mergers dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of autodesk and its subsidiaries taken as a whole materially change our business and incur subsidiary indebtedness subject to customary exceptions 

we are required to comply with the covenants set forth in our credit agreement if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or lenders then subject to applicable cure periods we would not be able to incur additional indebtedness under the credit agreement described in part 2 item 8 and any outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement may be declared immediately due and payable in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities under certain circumstances if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under our credit agreement could increase downgrades in our credit ratings could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing 

our investment portfolio consists of a variety of investment vehicles that are subject to interest rate trends market volatility and other economic factors if general economic conditions decline this could cause the credit ratings of our investments to deteriorate and illiquidity in the financial marketplace and we may experience a decline in interest income and an inability to sell our investments leading to impairment in the value of our investments 

it is our policy to invest our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in highly liquid instruments with and in the custody of financial institutions with high credit ratings and to limit the amounts invested with any one institution type of security or issuer however we are subject to general economic conditions interest rate trends and volatility in the financial marketplace that can affect the income that we receive from our investments the net realizable value of our investments including our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and our ability to sell them any one of these factors could reduce our investment income or result in material charges which in turn could impact our overall net income loss and earnings loss per share 

from time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies investments in privately held companies are considered inherently risky the technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is 

table of contents 

not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies 

a loss on any of our investments may cause us to record an otherthantemporary impairment charge the effect of this charge could impact our overall net income loss and earnings loss per share in any of these scenarios our liquidity may be negatively impacted which in turn may prohibit us from making investments in our business taking advantage of opportunities and potentially meeting our financial obligations as they come due 

changes in tax rules and regulations and uncertainties in interpretation and application could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions our effective tax rate is primarily based on our geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany arrangements including the manner we develop value and license our intellectual property and enacted tax rules significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis while we believe our tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be challenged by tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate and cash taxes 

tax laws in the united states and in foreign tax jurisdictions are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied for example the us government enacted significant tax law changes in december 2017 the us tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” which impacted our tax obligations and effective tax rate beginning in our fiscal 2018 tax year and significant tax legislation was included in the march 2020 cares act and subsequent consolidated appropriations act in december 2020 due to the complexity and varying interpretations of the tcja and the cares act the us department of treasury and other standardsetting bodies have been issuing and will continue to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that could significantly impact how we will apply the law and the ultimate effect on our results of operations from both the tcja and the cares act including for our prior tax years in addition increases in corporate tax rates could increase our effective tax rate cash taxes and have an adverse effect on our results from operations 

increasingly tax authorities are reviewing existing corporate tax regulatory and legal regimes many countries in the european union as well as other countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development are actively considering new taxing regimes and changes to existing tax laws if us or foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge how or where our profits are currently recognized our overall taxes could increase and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted 

if we were required to record an impairment charge related to the value of our longlived assets or an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets our results of operations would be adversely affected 

our longlived assets are tested for impairment if indicators of impairment exist if impairment testing shows that the carrying value of our longlived assets exceeds their estimated fair values we would be required to record a noncash impairment charge which would decrease the carrying value of our longlived assets adversely affecting our results of operations our deferred tax assets include net operating loss amortizable tax assets and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods each quarter we assess the need for a valuation allowance considering both positive and negative evidence to determine whether all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized we continue to have a full valuation allowance against certain us and foreign deferred tax assets changes in the amount of the us and foreign jurisdictions valuation allowance could also result in a material noncash expense or benefit in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted and our results of operations could be materially affected we will continue to perform these tests on our worldwide deferred tax assets and any future adjustments to the realizability of our deferred tax assets may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

general risk factors 

our business may be significantly disrupted upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event 

our business is highly automated and relies extensively on the availability of our network and data center infrastructure our internal technology systems and our websites we also rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide to our customers and computer operations for our internal use the failure of our systems or hosted computer 

table of contents 

services due to a catastrophic event such as an earthquake fire flood tsunami weather event telecommunications failure power failure cyber attack terrorism or war including the significant military action against ukraine launched by russia and any related political or economic responses and counterresponses or otherwise by various global actors or the general effect on the global economy or business interruption from epidemics or pandemics or the fear of such events could adversely impact our business financial results and financial condition for example our corporate headquarters and executive offices are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area and face annual periods of wildfire danger which increase the probability of power outages and may impact employees’ abilities to commute to work or to work from home we have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems in order to reduce the potential impact of a catastrophic event however there can be no assurance that these plans and systems would enable us to return to normal business operations in addition any such event could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products this could in turn decrease that country’s or region’s demand for our products negatively impacting our financial results 

we are subject to legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries and we may be named in additional legal proceedings or become involved in regulatory inquiries in the future all of which are costly distracting to our core business and could result in an unfavorable outcome or a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or the trading prices for our securities 

we are involved in legal proceedings and receive inquiries from regulatory agencies as the global economy has changed and our business has evolved we have seen an increase in litigation activity and regulatory inquiries like many other technology companies the number and frequency of inquiries from us and foreign regulatory agencies we have received regarding our business and our business practices as well as the business practices of others in our industry have increased in recent years in the event we are involved in significant disputes or are the subject of a formal action by a regulatory agency we could be exposed to costly and timeconsuming legal proceedings that could result in any number of outcomes any claims or regulatory actions initiated by or against us whether successful or not could result in high defense costs damage awards injunctive relief increased costs of business fines or orders to change certain business practices significant dedication of management time diversion of operational resources or otherwise harm our business in any such event our financial results results of operations cash flows or trading prices for our securities could be negatively impacted 

changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practices could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the way we conduct our business further such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective 

we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting including an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year this assessment must include a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective and disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management if our management or independent registered public accounting firm identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion that our internal controls are effective investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 

in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements which if not accurate may significantly impact our financial results 

we make assumptions judgments and estimates for a number of items including revenue recognition for product subscriptions and enterprise business arrangements “ebas” the determination of the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities goodwill financial instruments including strategic investments longlived assets and intangible assets the realizability of deferred tax assets and the fair value of stock awards we also make assumptions judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions variable compensation partner incentive programs product returns 

table of contents 

reserves allowances for credit losses asset retirement obligations legal contingencies and operating lease liabilities these assumptions judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from our estimates and such differences could significantly impact our financial results

 item 2 properties 

we lease approximately 1830000 square feet of office space in 101 locations in the united states and internationally through our foreign subsidiaries our executive offices are in leased office space in san francisco california and our corporate headquarters are in leased office space in san rafael california our san rafael facilities consist of approximately 116000 square feet under leases that expire in december 2024 our san francisco facilities consist of approximately 284000 square feet under leases that have expiration dates ranging from december 2022 to june 2026 we and our foreign subsidiaries lease additional space in various locations throughout the world for local sales product development and technical support personnel 

all facilities are in good condition the covid19 pandemic has spurred changes in the way we work as we move to a more hybrid workforce resulting in an evaluation of our office space needs accordingly we are reducing the square footage of our facilities portfolio by approximately 20 percent worldwide and incurred impairments to assets associated with our operating leases for real estate in the fiscal year ended january 31 2022 and expect to incur impairments over the next several quarters see part ii item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 9 “leases” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information we believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet our requirements for the foreseeable future 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in a variety of claims suits investigations inquiries and proceedings in the normal course of business activities including claims of alleged infringement of intellectual property rights commercial employment tax prosecution of unauthorized use business practices and other matters in our opinion resolution of pending matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position given the unpredictable nature of legal proceedings there is a reasonable possibility that an unfavorable resolution of one or more such proceedings could in the future materially affect our results of operations cash flows or financial position in a particular period however based on the information known by us as of the date of this filing and the rules and regulations applicable to the preparation of our financial statements any such amount is either immaterial or it is not possible to provide an estimated amount of any such potential loss

strategy 

autodesk is changing how the world is designed and made our technology spans architecture engineering construction product design manufacturing media and entertainment empowering innovators everywhere to solve challenges big and small from greener buildings to smarter products to more mesmerizing blockbusters autodesk technology helps our customers to design and make a better world for all 

our strategy is to build enduring relationships with customers delivering innovative technology that provides valuable automation and insight into their design and make process to drive execution of our strategy we are focused on three strategic priorities delivering on the promise of subscription digitizing the company and reimagining construction manufacturing and production 

we equip and inspire our users with the tailored tools services and access they need for success today and tomorrow at every step we help users harness the power of data to build upon their ideas and explore new ways of imagining collaborating and creating to achieve better outcomes for their customers for society and for the world and because creativity can’t flourish in silos we connect what matters  from steps in a project to collaborators on a unified platform 

autodesk was founded during the platform transition from mainframe computers and engineering workstations to personal computers we have developed and sustained a compelling value proposition based upon software for the personal computer just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry the software industry has undergone a transition from developing and selling perpetual licenses and onpremises products to subscriptions and cloudenabled technologies 

product evolution 

we offer subscriptions for individual products and industry collections enterprise business arrangements “ebas” and cloud service offerings collectively referred to as “subscription plan” subscription plans are designed to give our customers more flexibility with how they use our offerings and to attract a broader range of customers such as projectbased users and small businesses 

our subscription plans currently represent a hybrid of desktop software and cloud functionality which provides a deviceindependent collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders our cloud offerings for example bim 360 fusion 360 shotgrid autocad web app and autocad mobile app provide tools including mobile and collaboration capabilities to streamline design collaboration building and manufacturing and data management processes we believe that customer adoption of these latest offerings will continue to grow as customers across a range of industries begin to take advantage of the scalable computing power and flexibility provided through these services 

industry collections provide our customers with access to a broader selection of autodesk solutions and services simplifying the customers’ ability to benefit from a complete set of tools for their industry 

to support our strategic priority of reimagining architecture engineering and construction “aec” we are strengthening the foundation of our aec solutions with both organic and inorganic investments in fiscal 2022 we acquired storm uk holdco limited the parent of innovyze inc “innovyze” which provides water infrastructure software combining innovyze’s hydraulic modeling simulation asset performance management and operational analytics solutions with autodesk’s design and analysis solutions including autodesk civil 3d autodesk infraworks and the autodesk construction cloud enables us to deliver endtoend cloudbased solutions for our water infrastructure customers that drive efficiency and sustainability other acquisitions in fiscal 2022 include a cloudbased estimating solution that enables construction teams to create estimates perform digital takeoffs generate detailed reports and proposals and manage bidday processes in fiscal 2021 we acquired spacemaker which uses cloudbased artificial intelligence ai and generative design to help architects 

table of contents 

urban designers and real estate developers make faster and more informed earlystage design decisions which can help maximize the longterm sustainability and return from property investments other acquisitions in fiscal 2021 included solutions that use artificial intelligence and machine learning to extract and process data from project plans and specifications allowing general contractors subcontractors and owners to automate workflows such as submittals and project closeout 

in manufacturing our strategy is to combine organic and acquired software in existing and adjacent verticals to create endtoend cloudbased solutions for our customers that drive efficiency and sustainability we continue to attract both global manufacturing leaders and disruptive startups with our generative design and cloudbased fusion 360 that converges the process of design with manufacturing a fiscal 2021 acquisition included a leading provider of postprocessing and machine simulation solutions in fiscal 2022 we acquired upchain an instanton cloudbased data management technology that allows product design and manufacturing customers to collaborate in the cloud across their value chains and bring products to market faster 

our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products technology and businesses acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers however they entail cost and integration challenges and may in certain instances negatively impact our operating margins we continually review these factors in making decisions regarding acquisitions we currently anticipate that we will continue to acquire products technology and businesses as compelling opportunities become available 

global reach 

we sell our products and services globally through a combination of indirect and direct channels our indirect channels include value added resellers direct market resellers distributors computer manufacturers and other software developers our direct channels include internal sales resources dedicated to selling in our largest accounts our highly specialized solutions and business transacted through our online autodesk branded store see note 2 revenue recognition in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the results of our indirect and direct channel sales for the fiscal years ended january 31 2022 2021 and 2020 

we anticipate that our channel mix will continue to change as we scale our online autodesk branded store business and our largest accounts shift towards directonly business models however we expect our indirect channel will continue to transact and support the majority of our customers and revenue we employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our direct and indirect channels with our business strategies in addition we have a worldwide user group organization and we have created online user communities dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products 

one of our key strategies is to maintain an openarchitecture design of our software products to facilitate thirdparty development of complementary products and industryspecific software solutions this approach enables customers and third parties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses we offer several programs that provide strategic investment funding technological platforms user communities technical support forums and events to developers who develop addon applications for our products for example we have established the autodesk forge developer platform to support innovators that build solutions to facilitate the development of a single connected ecosystem for the future of how things are designed made and used as well as support ideas that push the boundaries of 3d printing 

in addition to the competitive advantages afforded by our technology our large global network of distributors resellers thirdparty developers customers educators educational institutions learning partners and students is a key competitive advantage which has been cultivated over an extensive period this network of partners and relationships provides us with a broad and deep reach into volume markets around the world our distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with the resources to purchase deploy learn and support our solutions quickly and easily we have a significant number of registered thirdparty developers who create products that work well with our solutions and extend them for a variety of specialized applications

additional information about our environmental social and governance program are available in our annual impact report on our website at wwwautodeskcom information contained on or accessible through our website is not part of or incorporated by reference into this report 

assumptions behind our strategy 

our strategy depends upon a number of assumptions including making our technology available to mainstream markets leveraging our large global network of distributors resellers thirdparty developers customers educators educational institutions learning partners and students improving the performance and functionality of our products and adequately protecting our intellectual property if the outcome of any of these assumptions differs from our expectations we may not be able to implement our strategy which could potentially adversely affect our business for further discussion regarding these and related risks see part i item 1a “risk factors” 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

our significant accounting policies are described in part ii item 8 note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements we believe that of all our significant accounting policies the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the accounting policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition    judgments with multiple performance obligations our contracts with customers may include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer a performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as a single performance obligation may require significant judgment that requires us to assess the nature of the promise and value delivered to the customer and the interaction of the desktop applications and cloud functionalities 

for our product subscriptions cloud service offerings and flexible enterprise business arrangements the functional nature of the promise as well as the customers’ value expectations led us to conclude desktop applications and cloud functionalities are not distinct in the context of the contract and should be accounted for as a single performance obligation there is a high degree of interaction of the desktop applications and cloud functionalities which is not available with the desktop applications alone or in conjunction with thirdparty cloud service providers furthermore customers are not able to use the desktop applications for its intended purpose without our cloud functionalities 

table of contents 

for contracts with more than one performance obligation the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations in an amount that depicts the relative standalone selling price “ssp” of each obligation judgment is required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount that should be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services 

in instances where ssp is not directly observable such as when we do not sell the product or service separately we determine the ssp using information that includes market conditions and other observable inputs we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer and circumstance in these instances we use relevant information such as the sales channel to determine the ssp 

strategic investments strategic investment debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity the carrying value is adjusted for our strategic investment equity securities if there are observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment as discussed below the determination of whether an orderly transaction is for a same or similar investment requires significant management judgment including the nature of rights and obligations of the investments the extent to which differences in those rights and obligations would affect the fair values of those investments and the impact of any differences based on the stage of operational development of the investee 

these assumptions are inherently subjective and involve significant management judgment whenever possible we use observable market data and rely on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available when determining fair value 

we assess our strategic investment debt and equity securities portfolio quarterly for impairment strategic investment equity securities are assessed based on available information such as current cash positions earnings and cash flow forecasts recent operational performance and any other readily available market data for any availableforsale debt securities if autodesk does not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that autodesk will be required to sell the availableforsale debt security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis autodesk will determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is due to creditrelated factors the credit loss is measured as the amount by which the debt security’s amortized cost basis exceeds the estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected up to the difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value impairment will be assessed at the individual security level creditrelated impairment is recognized as an allowance on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding adjustment to “interest and other expense net” on the company’s consolidated statements of operations any impairment that is not creditrelated is recognized in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” on the consolidated balance sheets 

for our quarterly impairment assessment of privately held debt and equity securities the analysis encompasses an assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment and qualitative and quantitative analysis of other key factors including the investee’s financial metrics the investee’s products and technologies meeting or exceeding predefined milestones market acceptance of the product or technology other competitive products or technology in the market general market conditions management and governance structure of the investee the investee’s liquidity debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash 

business combinations the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date with the exception of contract assets and contract liabilities ie deferred revenue which are recognized and measured on the acquisition date in accordance with autodesk’s “revenue recognition” policy in note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations 

although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain and unpredictable unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results examples of critical estimates used in valuing certain of the intangible assets and in determining the assets’ useful lives for the assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to 

• future expected cash flows from subscriptions and maintenance agreements sales and acquired developed technologies 

table of contents 

• the acquired companys trade name and patents as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and patents will continue to be used in our product portfolio 

• expected growth in revenue from the acquired company’s existing customer relationships 

• expected costs to develop the inprocess research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed 

• uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed and 

• discount rates used to determine the present value of estimated future cash flows 

realizability of longlived assets we assess the realizability of our longlived assets and related intangible assets other than goodwill quarterly or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review significant underperformance of a business or product line relative to budget shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends and the results of past impairment reviews when such events or changes in circumstances occur we assess recoverability of these assets 

we assess recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows we would perform a discounted cash flow analysis to assess impairments on longlived assets 

the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model include the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset group over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows we also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite lives 

variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge impairment charges if any result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values 

income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability approach under this method deferred tax assets including those related to tax loss carryforwards and credits and deferred tax liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we recognize the tax benefit for an uncertain tax position when it meets the more likely than not threshold for recognition we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense 

a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be recovered the valuation allowance is determined by assessing both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable such assessment is required on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis significant judgment is required in determining whether the valuation allowance should be recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for or release of a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income 

as we continually strive to optimize our overall business model tax planning strategies may become feasible and prudent whereby management may determine that it is more likely than not that the netherlands canada australia california michigan and us capital loss deferred tax assets will be realized each quarter we will continue to evaluate the positive and negative evidence of our ability to utilize our global deferred tax assets 

loss contingencies  as described in part i item 3 “legal proceedings” and part ii item 8 note 10 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters due to inherent uncertainties related to these matters we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time until the final resolution of such matters there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the 

table of contents 

amount recorded as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations

overview of fiscal 2022 

• total net revenue was 439 billion during fiscal 2022 an increase of 16 compared to the prior fiscal year 

• recurring revenue as a percentage of net revenue was 96 for the fiscal year ending january 31 2022 compared to 97 for the same period in the prior fiscal year 

• net revenue retention rate “nr3” was within the range of 100 and 110 as of both january 31 2022 and 2021 

• deferred revenue was 379 billion an increase of 13 compared to the prior fiscal year 

• remaining performance obligations shortterm and longterm deferred revenue plus unbilled deferred revenue “rpo” was 474 billion an increase of 12 compared to the fourth quarter in the prior fiscal year 

• current remaining performance obligations were 314 billion an increase of 15 compared to the prior fiscal year 

revenue analysis 

during fiscal 2022 net revenue increased 16 as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to a 19 increase in subscription revenue partially offset by a 58 decrease in maintenance revenue 

further discussion of the drivers of these results are discussed below under the heading “results of operations” 

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the united states and international regions including tech data corporation and its global affiliates collectively “tech data” and ingram micro inc “ingram micro” total sales to tech data accounted for 36 37 and 35 of autodesk’s total net revenue during fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively ingram micro accounted for 9 of autodesks total net revenue during fiscal 2022 and 10 of autodesks total net revenue during both fiscal 2021 and 2020 our customers through tech data and ingram micro are the resellers and end users who purchase our software subscriptions and services should any of our agreements with tech data or ingram micro be terminated for any reason we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data or ingram micro would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue consequently we believe our business is not substantially dependent on tech data or ingram micro 

recurring revenue and net revenue retention rate 

in order to help better understand our financial performance we use several key performance metrics including recurring revenue and nr3 these metrics are key performance metrics and should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as these metrics are not intended to be combined with those items we use these metrics to monitor the strength of our recurring business we believe these metrics are useful to investors because they can help in monitoring the longterm health of our business our determination and presentation of these metrics may differ from that of other companies the presentation of these metrics is meant to be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or in isolation from our financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap please refer to the “glossary of terms” for the definitions of these metrics in part i item 1 business

foreign currency analysis 

we generate a significant amount of our revenue in the united states japan germany the united kingdom and finland 

the following table shows the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on our net revenue and total spend 

  

1 please refer to the “glossary of terms” in part i item 1 business for the definitions of our constant currency growth rates 

changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue total spend and income from operations in future periods we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on a portion of the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions but do not attempt to completely mitigate the impact of fluctuations of such foreign currency against the us dollar 

remaining performance obligations 

rpo represents deferred revenue and contractually stated or committed orders under early renewal and multiyear billing plans for subscription services license and maintenance for which the associated deferred revenue has not yet been recognized unbilled deferred revenue is not included as a receivable or deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets see part ii item 8 note 2 “revenue recognition” for more details on autodesks performance obligations 



  

rpo consisted of the following 



table of contents 

we expect that the amount of rpo will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons including the specific timing duration and size of customer subscription and support agreements varying billing cycles of such agreements the specific timing of customer renewals and foreign currency fluctuations historically we have had increased eba sales activity in our fourth fiscal quarter and this seasonality may affect the relative value of our billings rpo and collections in the fourth and first fiscal quarters 

balance sheet and cash flow items 

at january 31 2022 we had 181 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities our cash flow from operations increased to 153 billion for the fiscal year ended january 31 2022 from 144 billion for the fiscal year ended january 31 2021 we repurchased 40 million shares of our common stock for 109 billion during fiscal 2022 comparatively we repurchased 26 million shares of our common stock for 5494 million during fiscal 2021 further discussion regarding the balance sheet and cash flow activities are discussed below under the heading “liquidity and capital resources”

results of operations 

impacts of covid19 to autodesk’s business 

we are continuing to conduct business during the covid19 pandemic with substantial modifications to employee travel employee work locations and virtualization postponement or cancellation of certain sales and marketing events among other modifications we will continue to invest in critical areas such as research and development construction and digitizing the company to ensure our future success as we come out of the pandemic we have observed other companies as well as many governments continuing to take precautionary measures to address covid19 and they may take further actions that alter their normal business operations while government authorities in some geographies are removing or adding covid19 related business operations restrictions we continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners suppliers and stockholders including in response to outbreaks and variants 

additionally the covid19 pandemic has spurred changes in the way we work as we move to a more hybrid workforce resulting in an evaluation of our office space needs accordingly we are reducing our facilities portfolio worldwide and incurred impairment and accelerated depreciation charges of 1037 million to assets associated with our operating leases for real estate during the fiscal year ended january 31 2022 and expect to incur additional impairments over the next several quarters which we currently estimate could result in impairment charges that would range up to approximately 250 million depending on the thencurrent market conditions see note 9 “leases” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information optimizing our facilities costs will allow us to better deploy capital to further our strategy and drive growth however there is no guarantee that we will realize any anticipated benefits to our business including any cost savings or operational efficiencies or that our impairment charges would be limited to that amount 

we believe our investment in cloud products and a subscription business model backed by a strong balance sheet give us a robust foundation to successfully navigate the economic challenges of covid19 however supply chain disruption and resulting inflationary pressures a global labor shortage and the ebb and flow of covid19 including in specific geographies are currently impacting the pace of our recovery and our outlook the extent of the impact on our business in fiscal 2023 and beyond will depend on several factors including the full duration and the extent of the pandemic including as a result of outbreaks and variants actions taken by governments businesses and consumers in response to the pandemic speed and timing of economic recovery including in specific geographies speed of continued rollout of covid19 vaccines lifting of restrictions on movement and normalization of fulltime return to work and social events our billings and renewal rates including new business close rates rate of multiyear contracts pace of closing larger transactions and new unit volume growth and effect of the pandemic on margins and cash flow all of these factors continue to evolve and remain uncertain at this time and some of these factors are not within our control further discussion of the potential impacts of covid19 on our business can be found in part i item 1a “risk factors” 

net revenue by income statement presentation

significant military action against ukraine launched by russia or any related political or economic responses and counterresponses or otherwise by various global actors or the general effect on the global economy may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies have significantly affected and could continue to significantly affect our financial results for a given period even though we hedge a portion of our current and projected revenue increases to the levels of political and economic unpredictability or protectionism in the global market may impact our future financial results

interest and other expense net decreased by 295 million during fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 the decrease was primarily due to gains on dispositions marktomarket gains and a decrease in impairments of strategic investment equity securities in the current period as compared to the prior period offset in part by an increase in interest expense as a result of the issuance of debt in fiscal 2022 and a decrease in markto market gains on debt and equity securities held in a rabbi trust under nonqualified deferred compensation plans 

interest and other expense net increased by 342 million during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 the increase was primarily due to an increase in impairments and negative measurement alternative adjustments on our strategic investment equity securities and a decrease in interest income offset by a decrease in interest expense as result of the payment in full of our term loan and an increase in marktomarket gains on marketable securities 

interest expense and investment income fluctuates based on average cash marketable securities and debt balances average maturities and interest rates 

gains and losses on foreign currency are primarily due to the impact of remeasuring foreign currency transactions and net monetary assets into the functional currency of the corresponding entity the amount of the gain or loss on foreign currency is driven by the volume of foreign currency transactions and the foreign currency exchange rates for the year 

provision for income taxes 

we account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse furthermore on january 22 2018 the fasb released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” provisions of the tcja the gilti provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations the company has elected to recognize any potential gilti obligations as an expense in the period it is incurred 

income tax expense was 677 million and tax benefit was 6615 million for fiscal 2022 and 2021 relative to pretax income of 5647 million and 5467 million respectively for the same periods the tax expense for fiscal 2022 consists primarily of the us and foreign tax expense including withholding tax offset by sharedbased compensation deductions india withholding tax refunds and generation of federal tax credits tax benefit for fiscal 2021 consisted primarily of the us valuation allowance release us foreign derived intangible income permanent benefit sharebased compensation deductions and generation of federal tax credits offset by foreign tax expense including withholding tax 

a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be recovered the valuation allowance is determined by assessing both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable such assessment is required on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis significant judgment is required in determining whether the valuation allowance should be recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income 

in fiscal 2016 we considered cumulative losses in the united states from our business model transition as a significant source of negative evidence considering this negative evidence we determined that it was more likely than not that we would

not realize the us deferred tax assets and recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets similarly in fiscal 2018 we recorded a valuation allowance against our singapore deferred tax assets due to significant negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses foreign operations in the netherlands and canada that generated interest expense future creditable research in excess of earnings respectively also resulted in the historic recording of a full valuation under the more likely than not realizability criteria 

we released our singapore valuation allowance in fiscal 2020 due to positive evidence in the form of cumulative earnings resulting in a 420 million noncash benefit to earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we released the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the us resulting in a 6790 million noncash benefit to earnings we released the us valuation allowance in fiscal 2021 due to the following positive evidence 

• recent history of worldwide pretax earnings including cumulative earnings on a worldwide basis as of fiscal 2021 

• recent history of us taxable income 

• forecast of worldwide and us pretax earnings including a forecast of cumulative earnings in the us jurisdiction 

• forecast of us taxable income 

• reversal of deferred tax liabilities 

we have retained a valuation allowance against california and michigan deferred tax assets as well as deferred tax assets that will convert into a capital loss upon reversal as we do not have sufficient income of the appropriate character to benefit these deferred tax assets 

as we continually strive to optimize our overall business model tax planning strategies may become feasible whereby management may determine based on all available evidence both positive and negative that it is more likely than not that the netherlands canada australia california michigan and us capital loss deferred tax assets will be realized 

as of january 31 2022 we had 2067 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which 336 million would reduce our valuation allowance if recognized the remaining 1731 million would impact the effective tax rate it is possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next 12 months for an audit settlement of approximately 78 million 

our future effective annual tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate changes in valuation allowances level of profit before tax accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits and changes in tax laws a significant amount of our earnings is generated by our european and asia pacific subsidiaries our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates

other financial information 

in addition to our results determined under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” discussed above we believe the following nongaap measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the fiscal years ended january 31 2022 2021 and 2020 our gross profit income from operations operating margin net income and diluted net income per share on a gaap and nongaap basis were as follows in millions except for operating margin and per share data 

   

for our internal budgeting and resource allocation process and as a means to provide consistency in periodtoperiod comparisons we use nongaap measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis these nongaap measures do not include certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results we also use nongaap measures in making operating decisions because we believe those measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our earning potential and performance for management by excluding certain benefits credits expenses and charges that may not be indicative of our core business operating results for the reasons set forth below we believe these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors both because 1 they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and 2 they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to analyze the health of our business this allows investors and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management compare financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the longterm performance of our core business we also use some of these measures for purposes of determining companywide incentive compensation 

there are limitations in using nongaap financial measures because nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies the nongaap financial measures included above are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results in addition they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the nongaap financial measures we compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a gaap basis as well as a nongaap basis and also by providing gaap measures in our public disclosures the presentation of nongaap financial information is meant to be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or in isolation from the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap we urge investors to review the reconciliation of our nongaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures included below and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business

1 totals may not sum due to rounding 

our nongaap financial measures may exclude the following 

stockbased compensation expenses we exclude stockbased compensation expenses from nongaap measures primarily because they are noncash expenses and management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods moreover because of varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under fasb asc topic 718 we believe excluding stockbased compensation expenses allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies 

amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangibles we incur amortization of acquisitionrelated developed technology and purchased intangibles in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangibles is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by both the timing and size of our acquisitions management finds it useful to exclude these variable charges from our cost of revenues to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangible assets will recur in future periods 

ceo transition costs we exclude amounts paid to the company’s former ceos upon departure under the terms of their transition agreements including severance payments acceleration of restricted stock units and continued vesting of performance stock units and legal fees incurred with the transition also excluded from our nongaap measures are recruiting costs related to the search for a new ceo these costs represent nonrecurring expenses and are not indicative of our ongoing operating expenses we further believe that excluding the ceo transition costs from our nongaap results is useful to investors in that it allows for periodoverperiod comparability 

goodwill impairment this is a noncash charge to write down goodwill to fair value when there is an indication that the asset has been impaired as explained above management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

table of contents 

restructuring and other exit costs net these expenses are associated with realigning our business strategies based on current economic conditions in connection with these restructuring actions or other exit actions we recognize costs related to termination benefits for former employees whose positions were eliminated the closure of facilities and cancellation of certain contracts we exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing business and operating results we believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses 

leaserelated asset impairments and other charges   these charges are associated with the optimization of our facilities costs related to leases for facilities that we have recently vacated as a result of our onetime move to a more hybrid remote workforce in connection with these facility leases we recognize costs related to the impairment or abandonment of operating lease rightofuse assets computer equipment furniture and leasehold improvements and other costs we exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing business and operating results we believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses 

acquisitionrelated costs we exclude certain acquisitionrelated costs including due diligence costs professional fees in connection with an acquisition certain financing costs and certain integrationrelated expenses these expenses are unpredictable and depend on factors that may be outside of our control and unrelated to the continuing operations of the acquired business or our company in addition the size and complexity of an acquisition which often drives the magnitude of acquisitionrelated costs may not be indicative of such future costs we believe excluding acquisitionrelated costs facilitates the comparison of our financial results to the companys historical operating results and to other companies in our industry 

loss gain on strategic investments and dispositions we exclude gains and losses related to our strategic investments and dispositions of strategic investments purchased intangibles and businesses from our nongaap measures primarily because management finds it useful to exclude these variable gains and losses on these investments and dispositions in assessing our financial results included in these amounts are noncash unrealized gains and losses dividends received realized gains and losses on the sales or losses on the impairment of these investments and gain and loss on dispositions we believe excluding these items is useful to investors because they do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business and these losses or gains were incurred in connection with strategic investments and dispositions which do not occur regularly 

discrete tax provision items we exclude the gaap tax provision including discrete items from the nongaap measure of net income loss and include a nongaap tax provision based upon the projected annual nongaap effective tax rate discrete tax items include income tax expenses or benefits that do not relate to ordinary income from continuing operations in the current fiscal year unusual or infrequently occurring items or the tax impact of certain stockbased compensation examples of discrete tax items include but are not limited to certain changes in judgment and changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years certain costs related to business combinations certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets or changes in tax law management believes this approach assists investors in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations we believe the exclusion of these discrete tax items provides investors with useful supplemental information about our operational performance 

establishment release of a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets this is a noncash charge to record or to release a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets as explained above management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various cash expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

income tax effects on the difference between gaap and nongaap costs and expenses the income tax effects that are excluded from the nongaap measures relate to the tax impact on the difference between gaap and nongaap expenses primarily due to stockbased compensation amortization of purchased intangibles and restructuring charges and other exit costs benefits for gaap and nongaap measures 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of cash is from the sale of our software and related services our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employeerelated expenses such as compensation and benefits as well as general operating expenses for marketing facilities and overhead costs longterm cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following the acquisition of businesses software products or technologies complementary to our business repayment of debt common stock repurchases and capital expenditures including the purchase and implementation of internaluse software applications

at january 31 2022 our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 181 billion and net accounts receivable of 7161 million 

in september 2021 autodesk entered into an amended and restated credit agreement “credit agreement” by and among autodesk the lenders party thereto and citibank na as agent that provides for a revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of 15 billion with an option to be increased up to 20 billion which increased from an aggregate principal amount of 6500 million with an option to be increased up to 10 billion under our previous credit agreement the revolving credit facility is available for working capital or other business needs the maturity date on the credit agreement is september 30 2026 at january 31 2022 autodesk had no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement additionally as of march 14 2022 we have no amounts outstanding under the credit agreement see part ii item 8 note 8 “borrowing arrangements” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our covenant requirements if we are unable to remain in compliance with the covenants under the credit agreement we may not be able to draw on our revolving credit facility 

as of january 31 2022 we had 265 billion aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding see part ii item 8 note 8 “borrowing arrangements” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

our cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally our primary commercial banking relationship is with citigroup and its global affiliates in addition citibank na an affiliate of citigroup is one of the lead lenders and agent in the syndicate of our 15 billion revolving credit facility 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances are concentrated in a few locations around the world with substantial amounts held outside of the united states as of january 31 2022 approximately 66 of our total cash or cash equivalents and marketable securities are located in foreign jurisdictions and that percentage will fluctuate subject to business needs there are several factors that can impact our ability to utilize foreign cash balances such as foreign exchange restrictions foreign regulatory restrictions or adverse tax costs the tax act included a mandatory onetime tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and generally eliminated us taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions in future periods as a result earnings in foreign jurisdictions are generally available for distribution to the united states with little to no incremental us taxes we regularly review our capital structure and consider a variety of potential financing alternatives and planning strategies to ensure we have the proper liquidity available in the locations in which it is needed we expect to meet our liquidity needs through or in combination of current cash balances ongoing cash flows and external borrowings 

cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the risks detailed in part i item 1a titled “risk factors” we currently expect to have sufficient liquidity to manage through the covid19 pandemic but we will continue to monitor the impact of potential disruptions beyond our control based on our current business plan and revenue prospects we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of this annual report 

our revenue earnings cash flows receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for which we have put in place foreign currency contracts as part of our risk management strategy see part ii item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at january 31 2022 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 



 

1 this table generally excludes amounts already recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities certain purchase obligations as discussed below long term deferred revenue and amounts related to income tax accruals for uncertain tax positions since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities see part ii item 8 note 5 “income taxes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months in addition we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations

we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees including limited product warranties historically costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant but because potential future costs are highly variable we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations 

issuer purchases of equity securities 

autodesk’s stock repurchase program provides autodesk with the ability to offset the dilution from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and reduce shares outstanding over time and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders under the share repurchase program autodesk may repurchase shares from time to time in open market transactions privately negotiated transactions accelerated share repurchase programs tender offers or by other means the share repurchase program does not have an expiration date and the pace and timing of repurchases will depend on factors such as cash generation from operations available surplus the volume of employee stock plan activity remaining shares available in the authorized pool cash requirements for acquisitions economic and market conditions stock price and legal and regulatory requirements 

during the three and 12 months ended january 31 2022 we repurchased 23 million and 40 million shares of our common stock respectively at january 31 2022 81 million shares remained available for repurchase under the repurchase program approved by the board of directors this program does not have a fixed expiration date see part ii item 8 note 11 “stock repurchase program” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our revenue earnings cash flows receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency volatility that exists as part of our ongoing business operations we utilize cash flow hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions in addition we use balance sheet hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables and payables as of january 31 2022 and 2021 we had open cash flow and balance sheet hedge contracts with future settlements generally within one to 12 months contracts were primarily denominated in euros japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars singapore dollars swiss francs swedish krona and czech koruna we do not enter into foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

our option and foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of the respective periodends are summarized in us dollar equivalents as follows in millions 



we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue and operating expenses of certain anticipated transactions a sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january 31 2022 indicated that a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 31 2022 and 2021 would increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by 2178 million and 1186 million respectively a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the dollar from its value at january 31 2022 and 2021 would decrease the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by 1381 million and 1492 million respectively 

interest rate risk 

interest rate movements affect both the interest income we earn on our shortterm investments and the market value of certain longer term securities at january 31 2022 we had 7082 million of cash equivalents and marketable securities including 2357 million classified as shortterm marketable securities if interest rates were to move up by 50 or 100 basis points over a 12month period the market value change of these securities would not have a material impact on our results of operations 

other market risk 

from time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies privately held company investments generally are considered inherently risky the technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies see part ii item 8 note 3 “financial instruments” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding these strategic investments

in accordance with guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred our management’s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control activities of storm uk holdco limited the parent of innovyze inc “innovyze” which we acquired march 31 2021 as discussed in note 6 “acquisitions” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements the exclusion represents internal control over financial reporting of approximately 1 of consolidated net revenue and less than 1 of consolidated total assets we have included the financial results of innovyze in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 

our management has concluded that as of january 31 2022 our internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in item 8 herein

product development and introduction 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware operating systems and software in addition our customers’ requirements and preferences rapidly evolve as do their expectations of the performance of our software and services to keep pace with these changes we maintain a vigorous program of new product development to address demands in the marketplace for our products such as enabling more flexibility and sustainable outcomes 

the software industry has undergone a transition from developing and selling perpetual licenses and onpremises products to subscriptions and cloudenabled technologies to address this shift autodesk made a strategic decision to shift its business model from selling perpetual licenses to selling subscriptions subscription plan offerings are designed to give our customers increased flexibility with how they use our products and service offerings and to attract a broader range of customers such as projectbased users and small businesses subscriptions represent a combined hybrid offering of desktop software and cloud functionality which provides a deviceindependent collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders in 2017 we commenced a program to incentivize maintenance plan customers to move to subscription plan offerings maintenancetosubscription “m2s” while at the same time increasing maintenance plan pricing over time for customers that remain on maintenance plans as a result of this shift a substantial majority of our customers have converted to subscription plan offerings and we will be retiring all remaining maintenance plan offerings as of may 7 2021 additionally in order to 

table of contents 

offer better service to our customers we are transitioning our existing customers from serial numbers to named users we completed the migration of our singleuser subscriptions from serial numbers in fiscal 2021 and are transitioning multiuser subscriptions to named users through august 2023 

we dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to deliver additional automation and insights to our customers through artificial intelligence machine learning and generative design which increase efficiency and sustainability and reduce waste these investments further enhance our existing products and create new solutions and technologies which connect the workflows and data of our customers across the ecosystem of their projects and expand our market opportunity our tools connect and automate the phases of design and creation enabling greater collaboration and the seamless flow of data for individuals and teams across all phases 

our software is primarily developed internally however we also use independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities additionally we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing or licensing products and technology from third parties we continually review these investments to ensure that we are generating sufficient revenue or gaining a competitive advantage to justify their costs 

the majority of our research and product development is performed in the united states china singapore canada and the united kingdom however we employ experienced software developers in many of our other locations translation and localization of our products are performed in several local markets principally singapore and ireland we generally localize and translate our products into german french italian spanish russian japanese korean and simplified and traditional chinese 

we plan to continue managing significant product development operations internationally over the next several years we believe that our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize product development lower costs and integrate local market knowledge into our development activities we continually assess the significant costs and challenges including intellectual property protection against the benefits of our international development activities

marketing and sales 

we sell our products and services globally primarily through indirect channels consisting of distributors and resellers to a lesser extent we also transact directly with our enterprise and named account customers and with customers through our online autodesk branded store our indirect channel model includes both a twotiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a onetiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers we have a network of approximately 1700 resellers and distributors worldwide for fiscal 2021 approximately 69 of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers 

  

we anticipate that our channel mix will continue to change particularly as we scale our online autodesk branded store business and our largest accounts shift towards directonly business models importantly we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the near future we employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our reseller channel with our business strategies our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller networks the loss of or a significant reduction in business with any one of our major distributors or large resellers could harm our business see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

sales through our largest distributor tech data corporation and its global affiliates collectively “tech data” accounted for 37 of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended january 31 2021 and 35 of our net revenue for both fiscal years ended january 31 2020 and 2019 ingram micro inc “ingram micro” our secondlargest distributor accounted for 10 of autodesks total net revenue for both fiscal years ended january 31 2021 and 2020 and 11 of autodesks total net revenue for fiscal year ended january 31 2019 we believe our business is not substantially dependent on either tech data or ingram micro should any of the agreements between us and tech data or ingram micro be terminated for any reason we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data or ingram micro would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue no other distributor reseller or direct customer accounted for 10 or more of our revenue 

table of contents 

our customerrelated operations are divided into three geographic regions the americas europe middle east and africa “emea” and asia pacific “apac” each geographic region is supported by global marketing and sales organizations these organizations develop and manage overall marketing and sales programs and work closely with a network of domestic and international sales offices we believe that international sales will continue to comprise the majority of our total net revenue adverse economic conditions and currency exchange rates in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue including emerging economies may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance our international operations and sales subject us to a variety of risks see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

we also work directly with reseller and distributor sales organizations computer manufacturers other software developers and peripherals manufacturers in cooperative advertising promotions and tradeshow presentations we employ massmarketing techniques such as webcasts seminars telemarketing direct mailings sponsorships advertising in business and trade journals and social media we have a worldwide user group organization and we have created online user communities dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products and services 

we generate revenue primarily through various offerings that provide recurring revenue under our subscription plan customers can use our software anytime anywhere and get access to the latest updates to previous versions through termbased product subscriptions cloud service offerings and enterprise business agreements “ebas” historically we have had increased ebas sale activity in our fourth fiscal quarter this seasonality may not have an immediate impact on our revenue as we recognize subscription revenue over the term of the contract this seasonality may also affect the relative value of our billings rpo and collections in the fourth and first fiscal quarters with the discontinuation of the sale of perpetual licenses we have transitioned away from selling a mix of perpetual licenses and maintenance plans in favor of a consolidated subscription model however our customers who have previously purchased a perpetual use license for the most recent version of the underlying product are able to renew a previously purchased maintenance plan until maintenance offerings are retired as of may 7 2021 that provides them with unspecified upgrades when and if available and receive online support during the term of their maintenance contract 

customer and reseller support 

we provide technical support and training to customers through a multitiered support model augmented by direct programs designed to address certain specific customer needs most of our customers receive support and training from the resellers and distributors from which they purchased subscriptions or licenses for our products or services with autodesk in turn providing secondtier support to the resellers and distributors other customers are supported directly via selfservice using the autodesk knowledge network which guides customers to answers in our online support assets support forums or webinars or to support representatives using different modalities such as social media phone email and webchat we also support our resellers and distributors through technical product training sales training classes webinars and other knowledgesharing programs

sustainability 

climate change 

in addressing the global challenges posed by climate change we make it possible for our customers to innovate and respond to associated changes in regulation building code physical climate parameters and other climaterelated developments this effort can directly and indirectly create more demand for existing and new autodesk products and services in the short and longterm furthermore our leadership is committed to taking climate action and that commitment goes hand in hand with our values and reputation in the marketplace 

climate change management actions 

to drive continued progress and meet growing demand we continue to expand the solutions education and support we offer helping customers secure a competitive advantage for a lowcarbon future by designing highperformance buildings resilient cities and infrastructure and more efficient transportation and products to continue to grow this market we provide software and support to earlystage entrepreneurs nonprofit organizations and startup companies who are designing clean technologies we are expanding these offerings based upon demand and opportunity in response to challenges posed by climate change 

internally we are investing in best practices to mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions and climate change risk through investments in renewable energy energy efficiency and disaster management and recovery strategies in fiscal 2020 we attained our sciencebased greenhouse gas reduction target of 43 emissions reduced since fiscal 2009 and we have announced a new commitment to being netzero emissions by the end of fiscal 2021 our assured results on this new commitment will be published in our fiscal 2021 impact report 

emissions performance  other key performance indicators 

by end of fiscal 2020 autodesk had reduced its net greenhouse gas emissions for its operational boundary by 43 from our fiscal year 2009 baseline to 172000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent this reduction was accomplished through increased investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency in our global real estate portfolio and investments with our customers to create carbon avoidance projects that generate verified emission reduction credits more information about our sustainability commitment can be found in our annual impact reports which we have published on our website since 2008 our fiscal 2021 impact report will be published in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 

philanthropy 

the autodesk foundation the “foundation” a privately funded 501c3 charity organization established and solely funded by us leads our philanthropic efforts the purpose of the foundation is twofold to support employees to create a better world at work at home and in the community by matching employees’ volunteer time andor donations to nonprofit organizations and to support organizations and individuals using design to drive positive social and environmental impact in the latter case we use grant funding software donations and training to accomplish this goal selecting the most impactful and innovative organizations around the world thus leading to a better future for our planet on our behalf the foundation also administers a discounted software donation program to nonprofit organizations social and environmental entrepreneurs and others who are developing design solutions that will shape a more sustainable future in fiscal 2020 autodesk committed to target 1 of annual operating margin for the longterm support of the autodesk foundation

developer programs 

our business and our customers benefit from our relationships with an extensive developer network these developers create and sell their own interoperable products that further enhance the range of integrated solutions available to our customers one of our key strategies is to maintain an openarchitecture design of our software products to facilitate thirdparty development of complementary products and industryspecific software solutions this approach enables customers and third parties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses we offer several programs that provide strategic investment funding technological platforms user communities technical support forums and events to developers who develop addon applications for our products for example we created a web services platform autodesk forge which includes web services that enable software developers to rapidly develop the next generation of applications and experiences that will power the future of making things forge facilitates the development of a single connected ecosystem for integrating autodesk applications with other enterprise web and mobile solutions 

competition 

the markets for our products are highly competitive are subject to rapid change and can have complex interdependencies between many of the larger businesses we strive to increase our competitive separation by investing in research and development allowing us to bring new products to market and create exciting new versions of existing products that offer compelling efficiencies for our customers we also compete through investments in marketing and sales to more effectively reach new customers and better serve existing customers 

our competitors include large global publicly traded companies small geographically focused firms startup firms and solutions produced inhouse by their users our primary global competitors include adobe systems incorporated aveva group plc bentley systems inc dassault systèmes sa and its subsidiary dassault systèmes solidworks corp intergraph corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of hexagon ab msc software corporation nemetschek ag oracle corporation procore technologies inc ptc inc 3d systems corporation siemens plm and trimble navigation limited among others 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing power with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the industry continues to undergo a platform shift from the personal computer to cloud and mobile computing this shift further lowers barriers to entry and poses a disruptive challenge to established software companies the design software market is characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete both from existing competitors and by entry of new competitors with innovative technologies competition is increasingly enhanced by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies and the possibility that competitors in one vertical segment may enter other vertical segments that we serve in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources than we do because of these and other factors competitive conditions in these industries are likely to continue to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which could harm our business see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion of risks regarding competition 

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to better serve customers by offering new products including cloud and mobile computing products whether by internal development or acquisition and to continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to ease of use reliability performance range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation price and training 

intellectual property and licenses 

we maintain an active program to legally protect our investment in technology through intellectual property rights we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions the nature and extent of legal protection associated with each such intellectual property right depends on among other things the type of intellectual property right and the given jurisdiction in which such right arises we believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business 

nonetheless our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws and enforcement of the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws enforcement of intellectual 

table of contents 

property rights against alleged infringers can sometimes lead to costly litigation and counterclaims our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business 

from time to time we receive claims alleging infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights including patents disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to among other things costly litigation or product shipment delays which could harm our business 

we retain ownership of software we develop our combined hybrid offerings include both desktop software and cloud functionality desktop software is licensed to users pursuant to ‘click through’ or signed license agreements containing restrictions on duplication disclosure and transfer cloud software and associated services are provided to users pursuant to online or signed terms of service agreements containing restrictions on access and use 

we believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our intellectual property and the rapid ongoing technological changes in both the computer hardware and software industries we must rely principally upon software engineering and marketing skills to continually maintain and enhance our competitive market position 

while we have recovered some revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of our software solutions we are unable to measure the full extent to which unauthorized use of our software products exists we believe however that unauthorized use of our software is and can be expected to be a persistent problem that negatively impacts our revenue and financial results we believe that our transition from perpetual use software licenses to a subscriptionbased business model combined with the change from desktop to cloudbased computing will shift the incentives and means by which software is used without authorization 

in addition through various licensing arrangements we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others we expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing arrangements in the future as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions to support continued development and sales of our products and services some of these licensing arrangements require or may require royalty payments and other licensing fees the amount of these payments and fees may depend on various factors including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments offsetting considerations if any and the degree of use of the licensed technology 

see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion of risks related to protecting our intellectual property 

production and suppliers 

the production of our software products and services involves duplication or hosting of software media the way that we deliver software has evolved during our business model transition for certain cloudbased products we use a combination of colocated hosting facilities and increasingly amazon web services and to a lesser degree other infrastructureasaservice providers we offer customers an electronic software download option for both initial product fulfillment and subsequent product updates customers who choose electronic fulfillment receive the latest version of the software from our vendor’s secure servers customers may also obtain our software through media such as dvds and usb flash drives available from multiple sources the purchase of media and the transfer of the software programs onto media for distribution to customers are performed by us and by licensed subcontractors packaging materials are produced to our specifications by outside sources production is performed in leased facilities operated by independent thirdparty contractors to date we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the production of our software and documentation

talent 

our employees play a central role in the success of our longterm strategy autodesk’s culture code defines values and behaviors that support our commitment to being a customer company where each employee takes responsibility for understanding our customers’ needs expectations and experiences as of january 31 2021 we employed approximately 11500 people an increase from approximately 10100 employees as of the end of fiscal year 2020 none of our employees in the united states are represented by a labor union in certain foreign countries our employees are represented by trade unions or work councils we have never experienced any work stoppages and believe our employee relations are good reliance upon employees in other countries entails various risks and changes in these foreign countries such as government instability or regulation unfavorable to foreignowned businesses which could negatively impact our business in the future 

diversity and belonging 

autodesk is committed to building and maintaining a diverse workforce and a culture of belonging that welcomes people from all backgrounds perspectives and beliefs we have developed a holistic updated global diversity and belonging “db” strategy which began with inviting employees representing all levels regions organizations and a rich mix of demographics to join focus groups to share their feedback ideas and experiences our db strategy includes a variety of activities such as inclusive leadership training for all people managers and senior employees hiring manager and interview classes that include training on mitigating bias and inclusive practices and a db speaker series featuring leaders from a range of disciplines 

to help us build a more diverse workforce we have continued to invest in our diversity partnerships we partner with educational institutions such as hispanicserving institutions and historically black colleges and universities and professional organizations around the globe supporting underrepresented groups in technology we provide a variety of scholarships internship programs mentoring and development partnerships and program support to organizations focused on women and underrepresented groups 

we also have an emerging leaders program which is focused on developing a diverse cohort of leaders through professional development mentoring and networking opportunities in addition we provide ongoing development opportunities such as the autodesk mentorship program which provides oneonone mentorship relationships autodesk has seven employee resource groups “ergs” which are employeeled groups that bring employees together based on common backgrounds or diversity characteristics to foster a sense of belonging and connection

risks relating to our business and strategy 

our strategy to develop and introduce new products and services exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance costs related to product defects and large expenditures each of which may result in no additional net revenue or decreased net revenue 

the software industry is characterized by rapid technological changes as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences in recent years the industry has undergone a transition from developing and selling perpetual licenses and onpremises products to subscriptions and cloudenabled technologies customers are also reconsidering how they purchase software products which requires us to constantly evaluate our business model and strategy in response we are focused on providing solutions to enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative on their projects we devote significant resources to the development of new technologies in addition we frequently introduce new business models or methods that require a considerable investment of technical and financial resources such as our introduction of flexible subscription and service offerings and our transition of multisubscription plans to nameduser plans it is uncertain whether these strategies including our product and pricing changes will accurately reflect customer demand or be successful or whether we will be able to develop the necessary infrastructure and business models more quickly than our competitors we make such investments through further development and enhancement of our existing products and services as well as through acquisitions such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs and could result in decreased net revenue or profitability if we are not able to meet customer requirements either with respect to our software or the manner in which we provide such products or if we are not able to adapt our business model to meet our customers’ requirements our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted 

in particular a critical component of our growth strategy is to have customers of our autocad and autocad lt products as well as other individual autodesk products expand their portfolios to include our other offerings and cloudbased functionality and we are taking steps to accelerate this migration at times sales of our autocad and autocad lt or individual autodesk flagship products have decreased without a corresponding increase in industry collections or cloudbased functionality revenue or without purchases of customer seats to our industry collections should this continue our results of operations will be adversely affected 

our executive management team must continuously act quickly and with vision given the rapidly changing customer expectations and technology advancements inherent in the software industry the extensive and complex efforts required to create useful and widely accepted products and the rapid evolution of cloud computing mobile devices new computing platforms and other technologies such as consumer products although we have articulated a strategy that we believe will fulfill these challenges if we fail to execute properly on that strategy or adapt the strategy as market conditions evolve we may fail to meet our customers’ expectations be unable to compete with our competitors products and technology and lose the confidence of our channel partners and employees this in turn could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

the effects of the covid19 pandemic and related public health measures have affected how we and our customers are operating our respective businesses and the extent of the impact on our business and results of operations remains uncertain  

we are continuing to conduct business during the covid19 pandemic with substantial modifications to employee travel and work locations as well as virtualization postponement or cancellation of certain sales and marketing events among other changes we have observed other companies as well as governments taking precautionary measures to address covid19 we continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions to alter our business operations as may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners suppliers and stockholders the extent of the impact of any such modifications on our business including the effects on our customers and prospects and on our financial results remains uncertain 

in particular if we are not able to retain current customers and attract new business including multiyear contracts or if customer renewal rates decline or fluctuate it could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations during fiscal 2021 we took a number of actions to support our customers including extending payment terms to 60 days through the beginning of august 2020 offering free commercial use of our cloud collaboration products through june 2020 delaying the transition from multiuser licenses to nameduser licenses from may to august 2020 to minimize disruption and deferring a 20 maintenance price increase from may to august 2020 these actions have affected our cash flow and if these actions as well as our other sales and marketing activities are not successful in retaining current customers and in closing new business our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents 

given the evolving business environment as a result of the covid19 pandemic we are actively managing our spending reducing travel and entertainment expense monitoring our hiring rate and rationalizing our marketing spend we will continue to invest in critical areas such as rd construction and digitizing the company to support our future success as we come out of the pandemic if we are not able to successfully manage our spending and investment it could have a material adverse effect on our cash balances business and results of operations 

global economic and political conditions may further impact our industries business and financial results 

our overall performance depends largely upon domestic and worldwide economic and political conditions the united states and other countries’ economies have experienced cyclical downturns in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services restricted credit poor liquidity decreased government spending reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets bankruptcies and overall uncertainty these economic conditions can occur abruptly for example the coronavirus covid19 pandemic has caused additional uncertainty in the global economy and an economic downturn or recession in the united states or in other countries may occur or has already occurred and may continue the extent to which covid19 will impact our financial condition or results of operations is still uncertain and will continue to depend on developments such as the impact on our customers vendors distributors and resellers as well as other factors including the full duration and the extent of the pandemic actions taken by governments businesses and consumers in response to the pandemic speed and timing of economic recovery our billings and renewal rates including new business close rates rate of multiyear contracts pace of closing larger transactions and new unit volume growth and effect of the pandemic on margins and cash flow all of these factors continue to evolve and remain uncertain at this time and some of these factors are not within our control due to our subscriptionbased business model the effect of covid19 may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods if at all if economic growth in countries where we do business slows or if such countries experience further economic recessions customers may delay or reduce technology purchases our customers include government entities including the us federal government and if spending cuts impede the ability of governments to purchase our products and services our revenue could decline in addition a number of our customers rely directly and indirectly on government spending 

as described elsewhere in these risk factors we are dependent on international revenue and operations and are subject to related risks of conducting business globally trends toward nationalism and protectionism and the weakening or dissolution of international trade pacts may increase the cost of or otherwise interfere with conducting business these trends have increased political and economic unpredictability globally and may increase the volatility of global financial markets and the impact of such developments on the global economy remains uncertain political instability or adverse political developments in any of the countries in which we do business could harm our business results of operations and financial condition a financial sector credit crisis could impair credit availability and the financial stability of our customers including our distribution partners and channels a disruption in the financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking partners on which we rely for operating cash management any of these events could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business could be adversely impacted by the costs and challenges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments 

we regularly acquire or invest in businesses software solutions and technologies that are complementary to our business through acquisitions strategic alliances or equity or debt investments including several transactions in fiscal 2021 the risks associated with such acquisitions include the difficulty of integrating solutions operations and personnel inheriting liabilities such as intellectual property infringement claims failure to realize anticipated revenue and cost projections and expected synergies the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business in accordance with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and diversion of managements time and attention in addition such acquisitions and investments involve other risks such as 

• the inability to retain customers key employees vendors distributors business partners and other entities associated with the acquired business 

• the potential that due diligence of the acquired business or solution does not identify significant problems 

• exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of an acquisition including claims from terminated employees customers or other third parties 

• the potential for incompatible business cultures 

• significantly higher than anticipated transaction or integrationrelated costs 

table of contents 

• potential additional exposure to economic tax currency political legal and regulatory risks associated with specific countries and 

• the potential impact on relationships with existing customers vendors and distributors as business partners as a result of acquiring another business 

we may not be successful in overcoming such risks and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business in addition if we do not complete an announced acquisition transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner we may not realize the benefits of the acquisition to the extent anticipated acquisitions and investments have in the past and may in the future contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly financial results these fluctuations could arise from transactionrelated costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or writeoffs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments and could negatively impact our financial results 

we are dependent on international revenue and operations exposing us to significant international regulatory economic intellectual property collections currency exchange rate taxation political and other risks which could adversely impact our financial results 

international net revenue represented 66 of our net revenue in both fiscal 2021 and 2020 our international revenue some of which comes from emerging economies is subject to economic and political conditions in foreign markets including those resulting from economic and political conditions in the united states as well as countryspecific conditions related to covid19 such as varied speed of recovery in different geographies our total revenue is also impacted by the relative geographical and country mix of our revenue over time our dependency on international revenue makes us much more exposed to global economic and political trends which can negatively impact our financial results even if our results in the united states are strong for a particular period 

we anticipate that our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue and as we expand our international development sales and marketing expertise will provide significant support to our overall efforts in countries outside of the united states risks inherent in our international operations include 

• economic volatility 

• tariffs quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions 

• fluctuating currency exchange rates including devaluations currency controls and inflation and risks related to any hedging activities we undertake 

• changes in regulatory requirements and practices 

• delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology 

• different purchase patterns as compared to the developed world 

• operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices particularly in emerging economies 

• compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and other anticorruption laws 

• difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales and development operations 

• local competition 

• longer collection cycles for accounts receivable 

• us and foreign tax law changes and the complexities of tax reporting 

• laws regarding the free flow of data across international borders and management of and access to data and public networks 

• possible future limitations upon foreignowned businesses 

• increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities 

• inadequate local infrastructure 

• greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property 

• software piracy and 

table of contents 

• other factors beyond our control including popular uprisings terrorism war natural disasters and diseases and pandemics such as covid19 

some of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above 

the united kingdom’s exit from the european union “brexit” has exacerbated and may further exacerbate many of the risks and uncertainties described above the application of the trade and cooperation agreement between the european union the european atomic energy community and the united kingdom signed in december 2020 the “tca” could have adverse tax tax treaty banking operational legal regulatory or other impacts on our businesses in the region the withdrawal could also among other potential outcomes create currency volatility disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and significantly disrupt trade between the united kingdom and the european union and other parties uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the united kingdom economy the european union economies and the other economies in which we operate 

in addition in recent years the united states has instituted or proposed changes to foreign trade policy including the negotiation or termination of trade agreements the imposition of tariffs on products imported from certain countries economic sanctions on individuals corporations or countries and other government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries in which we do business new or increased tariffs and other changes in us trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries and certain foreign governments including the chinese government have instituted or considered imposing trade sanctions on certain usmanufactured goods the escalation of protectionist or retaliatory trade measures in either the united states or any other countries in which we do business such as a change in tariff structures export compliance or other trade policies may increase the cost of or otherwise interfere with the conduct of our business 

even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks 

we may not be able to predict subscription renewal rates and their impact on our future revenue and operating results 

our customers are not obligated to renew their subscriptions for our offerings and they may elect not to renew upgrade or expand their subscriptions we cannot assure renewal rates or the mix of subscriptions renewals customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate due to a number of factors including offering pricing competitive offerings customer satisfaction and reductions in customer spending levels customer activity or number of users due to economic downturns including as a result of the current covid19 pandemic or financial markets uncertainty if our customers do not renew their subscriptions or if they renew on less favorable terms our revenues may decline 

existing and increased competition and rapidly evolving technological changes may reduce our revenue and profits 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing devices with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the industry has undergone a transition from developing and selling perpetual licenses and onpremises products to subscriptions and cloudenabled technologies  this shift further lowers barriers to entry and poses a disruptive challenge to established software companies the markets in which we operate are characterized by vigorous competition both by entrants with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary offerings and technologies some of our competitors have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources furthermore a reduction in the number and availability of compatible thirdparty applications or our inability to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes including those related to cloud computing mobile devices and new computing platforms may adversely affect the sale of our solutions because of these and other factors competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which would likely harm our business 

our financial results key metrics and other operating metrics fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenue and financial results difficult to predict 

our quarterly financial results key metrics and other operating metrics have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so in the future these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines we also provide investors with quarterly and annual financial forwardlooking guidance that could prove to be inaccurate as a result of these fluctuations in addition to the other risks described in these risk factors some of the factors that could cause our financial results key metrics and other operating metrics to fluctuate include

table of contents 

• failure to appropriately estimate the scope of services under consulting arrangements 

we have also experienced fluctuations in financial results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic or political conditions in particular our financial results in europe during our third quarter are usually affected by a slower summer period and our apac operations typically experience seasonal slowing in our third and fourth quarters 

our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenue and are relatively fixed in the short term accordingly any revenue shortfall below expectations has had and in the future could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability greater than anticipated expenses or a failure to maintain rigorous cost controls would also negatively affect profitability 

we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from a small number of solutions including our autocadbased software products and collections and if these offerings are not successful our revenue would be adversely affected 

we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from sales of subscriptions of a limited number of our offerings including autocad software solutions based on autocad which include our collections that serve specific markets and products that are interoperable with autocad any factor adversely affecting sales of these subscriptions including the product release cycle market acceptance product competition performance and reliability reputation price competition economic and market conditions and the availability of thirdparty applications would likely harm our financial results during both fiscal 2021 and 2020 combined revenue from our autocad and autocad lt family products not including collections having autocad or autocad lt as a component represented 29 of our total net revenue respectively 

from time to time we realign or introduce new business and sales initiatives if we fail to successfully execute and manage these initiatives our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

as part of our effort to accommodate our customers’ needs and demands and the rapid evolution of technology from time to time we evolve our business and sales initiatives such as realigning our development and marketing organizations offering software as a service and realigning our internal resources in an effort to improve efficiency we may take such actions without clear indications that they will prove successful and at times we have been met with shortterm challenges in the execution of such initiatives market acceptance of any new business or sales initiative is dependent on our ability to match our customers’ needs at the right time and price often we have limited prior experience and operating history in these new areas of emphasis if any of our assumptions about expenses revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated and our financial results will be negatively impacted 

net revenue billings earnings cash flow or subscriptions shortfalls or volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline 

the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including the other risks described in these risk factors and the following 

• shortfalls in our expected financial results including net revenue billings earnings and cash flow or key performance metrics such as subscriptions including as a result of the current covid19 pandemic and how those results compare to securities analyst expectations including whether those results fail to meet exceed or significantly exceed securities analyst expectations 

• quarterly variations in our or our competitors’ results of operations 

• general socioeconomic political or market conditions including from an economic downturn or recession in the united states or in other countries 

• changes in forwardlooking estimates of future results how those estimates compare to securities analyst expectations or changes in recommendations or confusion on the part of analysts and investors about the short and longterm impact to our business 

• uncertainty about certain governments’ abilities to repay debt or effect fiscal policy 

• announcements of new offerings or enhancements by us or our competitors 

table of contents 

• unusual events such as significant acquisitions divestitures regulatory actions and litigation 

• changes in laws rules or regulations applicable to our business 

• outstanding debt service obligations and 

• other factors including factors unrelated to our operating performance such as instability affecting the economy or the operating performance of our competitors 

significant changes in the price of our common stock could expose us to costly and timeconsuming litigation historically after periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities a company becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management’s attention and resources 

as a result of our strategy of partnering with other companies for product development our product delivery schedules could be adversely affected if we experience difficulties with our product development partners 

we partner with certain independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities we believe our partnering strategy allows us to achieve efficiencies in developing new products and maintaining and enhancing existing product offerings this strategy creates a dependency on independent developers independent developers including those who currently develop solutions for us in the united states and throughout the world may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future in addition use of development resources through consulting relationships particularly in nonus jurisdictions with developing legal systems may be adversely impacted by and expose us to risks relating to evolving employment export and intellectual property laws these risks could among other things expose our intellectual property to misappropriation and result in disruptions to product delivery schedules 

social and ethical issues relating to the use of artificial intelligence in our offerings may result in reputational harm or liability 

social and ethical issues relating to the use of new and evolving technologies such as artificial intelligence “ai” in our offerings may result in reputational harm and liability and may cause us to incur additional research and development costs to resolve such issues we are increasingly building ai into many of our offerings as with many innovations ai presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption and therefore our business ai presents emerging ethical issues and if we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society we may experience brand or reputational harm competitive harm or legal liability potential government regulation in the space of ai ethics may also increase the burden and cost of research and development in this area subjecting us to brand or reputational harm competitive harm or legal liability failure to address ai ethics issues by us or others in our industry could undermine public confidence in ai and slow adoption of ai in our products and services 

risks relating to our operations 

security incidents may compromise the integrity of our or our customers’ offerings services data or intellectual property harm our reputation damage our competitiveness create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results 

as we digitize autodesk and use cloud and webbased technologies to leverage customer data to deliver the total customer experience we are exposed to increased security risks and the potential for unauthorized access to or improper use of our and our customers’ information like other software offerings and systems ours are vulnerable to security incidents we devote resources to maintain the security and integrity of our systems offerings services and applications online mobile and desktop we accomplish this by enhancing security features conducting penetration tests code hardening releasing security vulnerability updates and accelerating our incident response time we also provide annual information security training to our employees despite these efforts we may not prevent security incidents and we may face delays or other difficulties in identifying or responding to security incidents 

hackers regularly have targeted our systems offerings services and applications and we expect them to do so in the future security incidents could disrupt the proper functioning of our systems solutions or services cause errors in the output of our customers’ work allow unauthorized access to sensitive data or intellectual property including proprietary or confidential information of ours or our customers or cause other destructive outcomes the risk of a security incident particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyber terrorists has increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased these threats include identity theft unauthorized access dns attacks wireless network attacks viruses and worms advanced persistent threat apt applicationcentric attacks peertopeer attacks phishing malicious file uploads backdoor trojans and distributed denial of service ddos attacks for example in december 2020 it was widely reported that 

table of contents 

solarwinds an information technology company was the subject of a cyberattack that created security vulnerabilities for thousands of its clients we identified a compromised solarwinds server and promptly took steps to contain the incidents while we believe that no customer operations or autodesk products were disrupted as a result of this attack other similar attacks could have a significant negative impact on our systems and operations in addition third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees vendors partners or users to disclose information to gain access to our data or our users’ data and there is the risk of employee contractor or vendor error or malfeasance despite efforts to create security barriers to such threats it is impossible for us to entirely eliminate these risks 

if any of the foregoing security incidents were to occur or to be perceived to have occurred our reputation may suffer our competitive position may be diminished customers may stop paying for our solutions and services we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to evaluate and alleviate the security incident and to try to prevent further or additional incidents and we could face regulatory inquiry lawsuits and potential liability we could incur significant costs and liabilities including due to litigation indemnity obligations damages for contract breach penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations and costs for remediation and other incentives offered to customers or other business partners in an effort to maintain business relationships after a breach and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

we cannot assure you that any limitations of liability provisions in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim relating to a security breach or other security incident we also cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims related to a security breach or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business including our financial condition operating results and reputation 

we rely on third parties to provide us with a number of operational and technical services thirdparty security incidents could expose us to liability harm our reputation damage our competitiveness and adversely impact our financial results 

we rely on third parties such as amazon web services to provide us with operational and technical services these third parties may have access to our systems provide hosting services or otherwise process data about us or our customers employees or partners any thirdparty security incident could compromise the integrity or availability of or result in the theft of data in addition our operations or the operations of our customers or partners could be negatively affected in the event of a security breach and could be subject to the loss or theft of confidential or proprietary information including source code unauthorized access to data and other confidential or proprietary information may be obtained through breakins network breaches by unauthorized parties employee theft or misuse or other misconduct if any of the foregoing were to occur or to be perceived to occur our reputation may suffer our competitive position may be diminished customers may buy fewer of our offerings and services we could face lawsuits and potential liability and our financial results could be negatively impacted 

delays in service from thirdparty service providers could expose us to liability harm our reputation damage our competitiveness and adversely impact our financial results 

from time to time we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country for the provision of services and materials that we use in the operation of our business and production of our solutions inability of such third parties to satisfy our requirements could disrupt our operations or make it more difficult for us to implement our strategy if any of these situations were to occur our reputation could be harmed we could be subject to thirdparty liability including under data protection and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions and our financial results could be negatively impacted 

we are investing in resources to update and improve our information technology systems to digitize autodesk and support our customers should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing information technology systems disrupt our operations our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network and data center infrastructure technology systems and websites for our development marketing operational support sales accounting and financial reporting activities we continually invest resources to update and improve these systems to meet the evolving requirements of our business and customers in particular our transition to cloudbased products and a subscriptiononly business model involves considerable investment in the development of technologies as well as backoffice systems for technical financial compliance and sales resources such improvements are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or may uncover problems with those systems unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements

could result in disruption in our business operations loss of customers loss of revenue errors in our accounting and financial reporting or damage to our reputation all of which could harm our business 

our software is highly complex and may contain undetected errors defects or vulnerabilities each of which could harm our business and financial performance 

the software solutions that we offer are complex and despite extensive testing and quality control may contain errors defects or vulnerabilities some errors defects or vulnerabilities in our software solutions may only be discovered after they have been released any errors defects or vulnerabilities could result in the need for corrective releases to our software solutions damage to our reputation loss of revenue an increase in subscription cancellations or lack of market acceptance of our offerings any of which would likely harm our business and financial performance 

if we do not maintain good relationships with the members of our distribution channel or if our distribution channel suffers financial losses becomes financially unstable or insolvent or is not provided the right mix of incentives to sell our subscriptions our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected 

we sell our software products both directly to end users and through a network of distributors and resellers for fiscal 2021 and 2020 approximately 69 and 70 respectively of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the near future our ability to effectively distribute our solutions depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller network computer software distributors and resellers typically are not highly capitalized and have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction as well as during the past several years we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of distributors and resellers prior to our sales to them in the past we have taken steps to support them and may take additional steps in the future such as extending credit terms and adjusting our incentives these steps if taken could harm our financial results if our distributors and resellers were to become insolvent they would not be able to maintain their business and sales or provide customer support services which would negatively impact our business and revenue 

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including the distributors tech data and ingram micro tech data accounted for 37 and 35 of our total net revenue for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively and ingram micro accounted for 10 of our total net revenue for both fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively should any of our agreements with tech data or ingram micro be terminated we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data or ingram micro would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue consequently we believe our business is not substantially dependent on either tech data or ingram micro however if either distributor were to experience a significant business disruption or if our relationship with either were to significantly deteriorate it is possible that our ability to sell to end users would at least temporarily be negatively impacted this could in turn negatively impact our financial results for example in june 2020 an affiliate of funds managed by affiliates of apollo global management a global alternative investment manager acquired tech data and in december 2020 platinum equity a global investment firm announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire ingram micro from hna technology co ltd subject to stockholder and regulatory approvals if there is any reseller or end user uncertainty caused by either acquisition our ability to sell to these resellers and end users could at least temporarily be negatively impacted 

over time we have modified and will continue to modify aspects of our relationship with our distributors and resellers such as their incentive programs pricing to them and our distribution model to motivate and reward them for aligning their businesses with our strategy and business objectives changes in these relationships and underlying programs could negatively impact their business and harm our business further our distributors and resellers may lose confidence in our business move to competitive products or not have the skills or ability to support customers the loss of or a significant reduction in business with those distributors or resellers could harm our business in particular if one or more of such distributors or resellers were unable to meet their obligations with respect to accounts payable to us we could be forced to write off such accounts and may be required to delay the recognition of revenue on future sales to these customers these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

table of contents 

we rely on software from third parties and a failure to properly manage our use of thirdparty software could result in increased costs or loss of revenue 

many of our products are designed to include software licensed from third parties such thirdparty software includes software licensed from commercial suppliers and under public open source licenses while we have internal processes to manage our use of such thirdparty software if such processes are inadequate we may be subject to copyright infringement or other thirdparty claims if we are noncompliant with a license for commercial software we may be required to pay penalties or undergo costly audits pursuant to the license agreement in the case of opensource software licensed under certain “copyleft” licenses the license itself or a courtimposed remedy for noncompliant use of the open source software may require that proprietary portions of our own software be publicly disclosed or licensed this could result in a loss of intellectual property rights increased costs reengineering of our software damage to our reputation or loss of revenue 

in addition to risks related to license requirements usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties support indemnities assurances of title or controls on origin of the software or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code likewise some open source projects have known security and other vulnerabilities and architectural instabilities or are otherwise subject to security attacks due to their wide availability and are provided on an “asis” basis 

our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our success and ability to invest and grow depend largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical professional managerial sales and marketing personnel historically competition for these key personnel has been intense the loss of services of any of our key personnel including key personnel joining our company through acquisitions inability to retain and attract qualified employees in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions and financial goals 

we rely on thirdparty technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies our solutions and service development may be delayed and our financial results negatively impacted 

we rely on certain software that we license from third parties including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our offerings to perform key functions these thirdparty software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and the software may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs or delays until equivalent software can be developed identified licensed and integrated which would likely harm our business 

disruptions in licensing relationships and with thirdparty developers could adversely impact our business 

we license certain key technologies from third parties licenses may be restricted in the term or the use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business similarly we may not be able to obtain or renew license agreements for key technology on favorable terms if at all and any failure to do so could harm our business our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with thirdparty developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn in particular markets such disruptions have in the past and would likely in the future negatively impact these thirdparty developers and end users which could harm our business 

technology created by outsourced product development whether outsourced to third parties or developed externally and transferred to us through business or technology acquisitions involves additional risks such as effective integration into existing products adequate transfer of technology knowhow and ownership and protection of transferred intellectual property 

risks relating to laws and regulations 

increasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws may impact our business or expose us to increased liability 

our strategy to digitize autodesk involves increasing our use of cloud and webbased technologies and applications to leverage customer data to improve our offerings for the benefit of our customers to accomplish this strategy we must collect 

table of contents 

and otherwise process customer data which may include personal data federal state and foreign privacy and data security laws apply to the treatment of personal data the regulatory framework for data privacy and security issues is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future governments regulators plaintiffs’ attorneys privacy advocates and customers have increased their focus on how companies collect process use store share and transmit personal data 

the general data protection regulation “gdpr” is applicable in all european union member states and introduced new data protection requirements in the european union and substantial fines for noncompliance we have modified our privacy practices to comply with the gdpr and make use of model contractual clauses approved by the european commission in relation to the transfer of personal data from the european union to the united states on july 16 2020 the court of justice of the european union “cjeu” invalidated the euus privacy shield data transfer mechanism the “schrems ii ruling” we do not anticipate any immediate change in our customers’ ability to continue to use our services and transfer data between the eu and the united states as a result of the schrems ii ruling in the decision the cjeu imposed additional obligations on companies when relying on standard contractual clauses approved by the european commission “sccs” to transfer personal data this decision may result in european data protection regulators applying differing standards for and requiring ad hoc verification of transfers of personal data from europe to the united states in november 2020 the european commission released a draft of revised sccs addressing the cjeu concerns the european data protection board also issued recommendations that together with the revised sccs may require us to implement additional contractual and technical safeguards for any personal data transferred out of the european economic area which may increase compliance costs lead to increased regulatory scrutiny or liability and adversely impact our business financial condition and operating results the united kingdom has enacted a data protection act and legislation referred to as the “uk gdpr” that collectively substantially implement the gdpr and provides for substantial penalties for noncompliance however brexit has created uncertainty regarding data protection regulation in the united kingdom and how data transfers to and from the united kingdom will be regulated postbrexit the tca provides for unrestricted flow of personal data from the european union to the united kingdom until either april 30 2021 which may be extended until june 30 2021 by mutual agreement or until the european commission adopts a decision that uk data protection laws offer an adequate level of protection for personal data 

in addition in june 2018 california enacted the california consumer privacy act the “ccpa” which took effect in january 2020 the ccpa among other things gives california residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used in november 2020 california voters passed the california privacy rights act the “cpra” the cpra significantly expands the ccpa including by introducing additional obligations such as data minimization and storage limitations granting additional rights to consumers such as correction of personal information and additional optout rights and creates a new entity to implement and enforce the law the ccpa and cpra will require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and may cause us to incur substantial costs and expenses in order to comply several other countries including australia new zealand brazil and japan have also established specific legal requirements for crossborder transfers of personal information 

the gdpr ccpa and other state and global laws and regulations increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data and we have and will continue to put in place additional processes and programs to demonstrate compliance new privacy laws and regulations are under development at the us federal and state level and many international jurisdictions any actual or perceived failure to comply with the gdpr the ccpa or other data privacy laws or regulations or related contractual or other obligations or any perceived privacy rights violation could lead to investigations claims and proceedings by governmental entities and private parties damages for contract breach and other significant costs penalties and other liabilities as well as harm to our reputation and market position 

additionally we store customer information and content and if our customers fail to comply with contractual obligations or applicable laws it could result in litigation or reputational harm to us the gdpr ccpa and other laws and selfregulatory codes may affect our ability to reach current and prospective customers understand how our offerings and services are being used respond to customer requests allowed under the laws and implement our new business models effectively these new laws and regulations would similarly affect our competitors as well as our customers these requirements could impact demand for our offerings and services and result in more onerous contract obligations 

there is also an increasing trend towards data localization policies for example in 2015 russia introduced data localization laws and other countries such as india and china are considering data localization requirements if this trend continues and countries implement more restrictive regulations for crossborder data transfers or do not permit data to leave the country of origin our business financial condition and results of operations in those jurisdictions could be impacted 

table of contents 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls 

  

our offerings are subject to us export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations that prohibit the delivery of certain solutions and services without the required export authorizations or export to locations governments and persons targeted by us sanctions while we have processes to prevent our offerings from being exported in violation of these laws including obtaining authorizations as appropriate and screening against us government and international lists of restricted and prohibited persons we cannot guarantee that these processes will prevent all violations of export control and sanctions laws 

  

if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm as well as other negative consequences including government investigations and penalties we presently incorporate export control and sanctions compliance requirements in our channel partner agreements complying with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities violations of us sanctions or export control laws can result in fines or penalties 

if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights our business could be harmed 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright and trademark laws trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights however the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate while we have patent applications pending in the united states and throughout the world we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications in addition any patents issued to us in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties furthermore legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties from time to time have copied or reverse engineered aspects of our software or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our software is timeconsuming and costly we are unable to measure the extent to which unauthorized use of our software exists and we expect that unauthorized use of software will remain a persistent problem particularly in emerging economies 

additionally we actively protect the secrecy of our confidential information and trade secrets including our source code if unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code unauthorized disclosure of our source code could make it easier for third parties to compete with our offerings by copying functionality which could adversely affect our financial performance and our reputation we also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of nondisclosure agreements with our employees customers contractors vendors and partners however it is possible that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization if this were to occur it may be difficult andor costly for us to enforce our rights and our financial performance and reputation could be negatively impacted 

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in the loss of significant rights 

our competitors as well as a number of other entities and individuals may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our business third parties may claim that we are infringing upon or misappropriating their intellectual property rights and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights even if we are unaware of the intellectual property rights claimed against us as more software patents are granted worldwide the number of offerings and competitors in our industries grows and the functionality of products in different industries overlaps we expect that software developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims additionally certain patent assertion entities have become more aggressive in threatening and pursuing litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents 

any claims or threats of infringement or misappropriation whether with or without merit have been and could in the future be timeconsuming to defend result in costly litigation and diversion of resources cause product delays require us to change our products or business practices prevent us from offering our software and services or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in addition such royalty or license agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms if at all which would likely harm our business we may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners or pay substantial settlement costs including royalty payments in connection with any such claim or litigation and to obtain licenses modify applications or refund fees which could be costly furthermore from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products including in areas where we historically have not competed which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims

contracting with government entities exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government procurement process 

we provide products and services directly and indirectly to a variety of government entities risks associated with licensing and selling products and services to government entities include extended sales and collection cycles varying governmental budgeting processes and adherence to complex procurement regulations and other governmentspecific contractual requirements we may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts and any violations could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions including termination of contracts payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business as well as harm to our reputation and financial results 

risks relating to financial developments 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our cash flow exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as part of our risk management strategy we use foreign currency contracts to manage a portion of our exposures of underlying assets liabilities and other obligations which exist as part of our ongoing business operations these foreign currency instruments have maturities that extend for one to 18 months in the future and provide us with some protection against currency exposures however our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be completely successful resulting in an adverse impact on our financial results 

the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given period although our foreign currency cash flow hedge program extends beyond the current quarter in order to reduce our exposure to foreign currency volatility we do not attempt to completely mitigate this risk and in any case will incur transaction fees in adopting such hedging programs such volatility even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings 

in addition global events including the sudden and unexpected effects of the covid19 pandemic as well as geopolitical developments may contribute to volatility in foreign exchange markets which we may not be able to effectively manage and our financial results could be adversely impacted additionally countries in which we operate may be classified as highly inflationary economies requiring special accounting and financial reporting treatment for such operations or such countries’ currencies may be devalued or both which may adversely impact our business operations and financial results 

our debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations 

we have 165 billion of debt consisting of notes due at various times from december 2022 to january 2030 as described in part 2 item 8 we also entered into a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of 6500 million with an option to be increased up to 10 billion as described in part 2 item 8 maintenance of our indebtedness contractual restrictions and additional issuances of indebtedness could 

• cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations towards debt service obligations and principal repayments; 

• increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic industry and competitive conditions 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry 

• impair our ability to obtain future financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions general corporate or other purposes; and 

• due to limitations within the debt instruments restrict our ability to grant liens on property enter into certain mergers dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of autodesk and its subsidiaries taken as a whole materially change our business and incur subsidiary indebtedness subject to customary exceptions 

we are required to comply with the covenants set forth in our credit agreement if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or lenders then subject to applicable cure periods we would not be able to incur additional indebtedness under the credit agreement described in part 2 item 8 and any outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement may be declared immediately due and payable in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating 

table of contents 

may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities under certain circumstances if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under our credit agreement could increase downgrades in our credit ratings could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing 

our investment portfolio consists of a variety of investment vehicles that are subject to interest rate trends market volatility and other economic factors if general economic conditions decline this could cause the credit ratings of our investments to deteriorate and illiquidity in the financial marketplace and we may experience a decline in interest income and an inability to sell our investments leading to impairment in the value of our investments 

it is our policy to invest our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in highly liquid instruments with and in the custody of financial institutions with high credit ratings and to limit the amounts invested with any one institution type of security or issuer however we are subject to general economic conditions interest rate trends and volatility in the financial marketplace that can affect the income that we receive from our investments the net realizable value of our investments including our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and our ability to sell them any one of these factors could reduce our investment income or result in material charges which in turn could impact our overall net income loss and earnings loss per share 

from time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies investments in privately held companies are considered inherently risky the technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies 

a loss on any of our investments may cause us to record an otherthantemporary impairment charge the effect of this charge could impact our overall net income loss and earnings loss per share in any of these scenarios our liquidity may be negatively impacted which in turn may prohibit us from making investments in our business taking advantage of opportunities and potentially meeting our financial obligations as they come due 

changes in tax rules and regulations and uncertainties in interpretation and application could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions our effective tax rate is primarily based on our expected geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany arrangements including the manner we develop value and license our intellectual property and enacted tax rules significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis while we believe our tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be overturned by tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate and cash taxes 

tax laws in the united states and in foreign tax jurisdictions are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied for example the us government enacted significant tax law changes in december 2017 the us tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” which impacted our tax obligations and effective tax rate beginning in our fiscal 2018 tax year and significant tax legislation was included in the march 2020 cares act and subsequent consolidated appropriations act in december 2020 due to the complexity and varying interpretations of the tcja and the cares act the us department of treasury and other standardsetting bodies have been issuing and will continue to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that could significantly impact how we will apply the law and the ultimate effect on our results of operations from both the tcja and the cares act including for our prior tax years 

increasingly tax authorities are scrutinizing existing corporate tax regulatory and legal regimes many countries in the european union as well as other countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development are actively considering new taxing regimes and changes to existing tax laws that are contrary to the way we have interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations in our tax returns for such jurisdictions if us or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge how or where our profits are currently recognized our overall taxes could increase and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted 

table of contents 

if we were required to record an impairment charge related to the value of our longlived assets or an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets our results of operations would be adversely affected 

our longlived assets are tested for impairment if indicators of impairment exist if impairment testing shows that the carrying value of our longlived assets exceeds their estimated fair values we would be required to record a noncash impairment charge which would decrease the carrying value of our longlived assets adversely affecting our results of operations our deferred tax assets include net operating loss amortizable tax assets and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods each quarter we assess the need for a valuation allowance considering both positive and negative evidence to determine whether all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized we are releasing our valuation allowance against the majority of our us federal tax assets resulting in a material noncash benefit in this period we continue to have a full valuation allowance against certain us and foreign deferred tax assets changes in the amount of the us and foreign jurisdictions valuation allowance could also result in a material noncash expense or benefit in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted and our results of operations could be materially affected we will continue to perform these tests on our worldwide deferred tax assets and any future adjustments to the realizability of our deferred tax assets may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

general risk factors 

our business may be significantly disrupted upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event 

our business is highly automated and relies extensively on the availability of our network and data center infrastructure our internal technology systems and our websites we also rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide to our customers and computer operations for our internal use the failure of our systems or hosted computer services due to a catastrophic event such as an earthquake fire flood tsunami weather event telecommunications failure power failure cyber attack terrorism or war or business interruption from epidemics or pandemics or the fear of such events could adversely impact our business financial results and financial condition for example our corporate headquarters and executive offices are located near major seismic faults in the san francisco bay area and face annual periods of wildfire danger which increase the probability of power outages and may impact employees’ abilities to commute to work or to work from home we have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems in order to reduce the potential impact of a catastrophic event however there can be no assurance that these plans and systems would enable us to return to normal business operations in addition any such event could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products this could in turn decrease that country’s or region’s demand for our products negatively impacting our financial results 

we are subject to legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries and we may be named in additional legal proceedings or become involved in regulatory inquiries in the future all of which are costly distracting to our core business and could result in an unfavorable outcome or a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or the trading prices for our securities 

we are involved in legal proceedings and receive inquiries from regulatory agencies as the global economy has changed and our business has evolved we have seen an increase in litigation activity and regulatory inquiries like many other technology companies the number and frequency of inquiries from us and foreign regulatory agencies we have received regarding our business and our business practices as well as the business practices of others in our industry have increased in recent years in the event we are involved in significant disputes or are the subject of a formal action by a regulatory agency we could be exposed to costly and timeconsuming legal proceedings that could result in any number of outcomes any claims or regulatory actions initiated by or against us whether successful or not could result in high defense costs damage awards injunctive relief increased costs of business fines or orders to change certain business practices significant dedication of management time diversion of operational resources or otherwise harm our business in any such event our financial results results of operations cash flows or trading prices for our securities could be negatively impacted 

changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practices could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the way we conduct our business further such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective 

table of contents 

we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting including an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year this assessment must include a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective and disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management if our management or independent registered public accounting firm identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion that our internal controls are effective investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 

in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements which if not accurate may significantly impact our financial results 

we make assumptions judgments and estimates for a number of items including revenue recognition for product subscriptions and enterprise business arrangements “ebas” the determination of the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities goodwill financial instruments including strategic investments longlived assets and other intangible assets the realizability of deferred tax assets and the fair value of stock awards we also make assumptions judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions variable compensation partner incentive programs product returns reserves allowances for credit losses asset retirement obligations legal contingencies and operating lease liabilities these assumptions judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from our estimates and such differences could significantly impact our financial results

strategy 

autodesk makes software for people who make things if you have ever driven a highperformance car admired a towering skyscraper used a smartphone or watched a great film chances are you have experienced what millions of autodesk customers are doing with our software we empower innovators to achieve the new possible  enabling them to discover firstinkind solutions to complex design challenges deliver tangible outcomes in record time and make datapowered decisions for sustainable outcomes 

our strategy is to build enduring relationships with customers delivering innovative technology that provides valuable automation and insight into their design and make process to drive execution of our strategy we are focused on three strategic priorities delivering on the promise of subscription digitizing the company and reimagining construction manufacturing and production 

we equip and inspire our users with the tailored tools services and access they need for success today and tomorrow at every step we help users harness the power of data to build upon their ideas and explore new ways of imagining collaborating and creating to achieve better outcomes for their customers for society and for the world and because creativity can’t flourish in silos we connect what matters  from steps in a project to collaborators on a unified platform 

autodesk was founded during the platform transition from mainframe computers and engineering workstations to personal computers we have developed and sustained a compelling value proposition based upon desktop software for the personal computer just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry over 30 years ago the software industry has undergone a transition from developing and selling perpetual licenses and onpremises products to subscriptions and cloudenabled technologies 

product evolution 

we offer subscriptions for individual products and industry collections enterprise business arrangements “ebas” and cloud service offerings collectively referred to as “subscription plan” subscription plans are designed to give our customers more flexibility with how they use our offerings and to attract a broader range of customers such as projectbased users and small businesses 

our subscription plans currently represent a hybrid of desktop software and cloud functionality which provides a deviceindependent collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders our cloud offerings for example bim 360 shotgun autocad web app and autocad mobile app provide tools including mobile and collaboration capabilities to streamline design collaboration building and manufacturing and data management processes we believe that customer adoption of these latest offerings will continue to grow as customers across a range of industries begin to take advantage of the scalable computing power and flexibility provided through these services 

industry collections provide our customers with access to a broader selection of autodesk solutions and services simplifying the customers’ ability to benefit from a complete set of tools for their industry 

we discontinued the sale of new commercial licenses of most individual software products in fiscal 2016 additionally in fiscal 2018 we commenced a program to incentivize maintenance plan customers to move to subscription plan offerings maintenancetosubscription “m2s”  while at the same time increasing maintenance plan pricing over time for customers that remain on maintenance plans since launching the program a substantial majority of maintenance plan customers have converted to subscription plan offerings  we will be retiring maintenance plan offerings as of may 7 2021 and will allow customers to convert their remaining maintenance seats to subscription plan offerings prior to this date

to support our strategic priority of reimagining aec we are strengthening the foundation of our aec solutions with both organic and inorganic investments in fiscal 2021 we acquired spacemaker which uses cloudbased artificial intelligence ai and generative design to help architects urban designers and real estate developers make faster and more informed earlystage design decisions which can help maximize the longterm sustainability and return from property investments other acquisitions in fiscal 2021 included solutions that use artificial intelligence and machine learning to extract and process data from project plans and specifications allowing general contractors subcontractors and owners to automate workflows such as submittals and project closeout as well as a leading provider of postprocessing and machine simulation solutions in manufacturing 

as part of our strategy in manufacturing we continue to attract both global manufacturing leaders and disruptive startups with our generative design and cloudbased fusion 360 technology enhancements 

our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products technology and businesses acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers however they entail cost and integration challenges and may in certain instances negatively impact our operating margins we continually review these factors in making decisions regarding acquisitions we currently anticipate that we will continue to acquire products technology and businesses as compelling opportunities become available 

global reach 

we sell our products and services globally through a combination of indirect and direct channels our indirect channels include value added resellers direct market resellers distributors computer manufacturers and other software developers our direct channels include internal sales resources dedicated to selling in our largest accounts our highly specialized solutions and business transacted through our online autodesk branded store see note 2 revenue recognition in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the results of our indirect and direct channel sales for the fiscal years ended january 31 2021 2020 and 2019 

we anticipate that our channel mix will continue to change as we scale our online autodesk branded store business and our largest accounts shift towards directonly business models however we expect our indirect channel will continue to transact and support the majority of our customers and revenue we employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our direct and indirect channels with our business strategies in addition we have a worldwide user group organization and we have created online user communities dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products 

one of our key strategies is to maintain an openarchitecture design of our software products to facilitate thirdparty development of complementary products and industryspecific software solutions this approach enables customers and third parties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses we offer several programs that provide strategic investment funding technological platforms user communities technical support forums and events to developers who develop addon applications for our products for example we have established the autodesk forge developer program to support innovators that build solutions to facilitate the development of a single connected ecosystem for the future of how things are designed made and used as well as support ideas that push the boundaries of 3d printing 

in addition to the competitive advantages afforded by our technology our large global network of distributors resellers thirdparty developers customers educators educational institutions learning partners and students is a key competitive advantage which has been cultivated over an extensive period this network of partners and relationships provides us with a broad and deep reach into volume markets around the world our distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with the resources to purchase deploy learn and support our solutions quickly and easily we have a significant number of registered thirdparty developers who create products that work well with our solutions and extend them for a variety of specialized applications

assumptions behind our strategy 

our strategy depends upon a number of assumptions including making our technology available to mainstream markets leveraging our large global network of distributors resellers thirdparty developers customers educators educational institutions learning partners and students improving the performance and functionality of our products and adequately protecting our intellectual property if the outcome of any of these assumptions differs from our expectations we may not be able to implement our strategy which could potentially adversely affect our business for further discussion regarding these and related risks see part i item 1a “risk factors” 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

our significant accounting policies are described in part ii item 8 note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements we believe that of all our significant accounting policies the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the accounting policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition    judgments with multiple performance obligations our contracts with customers may include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer a performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as a single performance obligation may require significant judgment that requires us to assess the nature of the promise and value delivered to the customer and the interaction of the desktop applications and cloud functionalities 

for our product subscriptions cloud service offerings and flexible enterprise business arrangements the functional nature of the promise as well as the customers’ value expectations led us to conclude desktop applications and cloud functionalities are not distinct in the context of the contract and should be accounted for as a single performance obligation there is a high degree of interaction of the desktop applications and cloud functionalities which is not available with the desktop applications alone or in conjunction with thirdparty cloud service providers furthermore customers are not able to use the desktop applications for its intended purpose without our cloud functionalities 

for contracts with more than one performance obligation the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations in an amount that depicts the relative standalone selling price “ssp” of each obligation judgment is required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount that should be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services 

table of contents 

in instances where ssp is not directly observable such as when we do not sell the product or service separately we determine the ssp using information that includes market conditions and other observable inputs we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer and circumstance in these instances we use relevant information such as the sales channel to determine the ssp 

strategic investments strategic investment debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity the carrying value is adjusted for our strategic investment equity securities if there are observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment as discussed below the determination of whether an orderly transaction is for a same or similar investment requires significant management judgment including the nature of rights and obligations of the investments the extent to which differences in those rights and obligations would affect the fair values of those investments and the impact of any differences based on the stage of operational development of the investee 

these assumptions are inherently subjective and involve significant management judgment whenever possible we use observable market data and rely on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available when determining fair value 

we assess our strategic investment debt and equity securities portfolio quarterly for impairment strategic investment equity securities are assessed based on available information such as current cash positions earnings and cash flow forecasts recent operational performance and any other readily available market data for any availableforsale debt securities if autodesk does not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that autodesk will be required to sell the availableforsale debt security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis autodesk will determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is due to creditrelated factors the credit loss is measured as the amount by which the debt security’s amortized cost basis exceeds the estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected up to the difference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value impairment will be assessed at the individual security level creditrelated impairment is recognized as an allowance on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding adjustment to “interest and other expense net” on the company’s consolidated statements of operations any impairment that is not creditrelated is recognized in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” on the consolidated balance sheets 

for our quarterly impairment assessment of privately held debt and equity securities the analysis encompasses an assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment and qualitative and quantitative analysis of other key factors including the investee’s financial metrics the investee’s products and technologies meeting or exceeding predefined milestones market acceptance of the product or technology other competitive products or technology in the market general market conditions management and governance structure of the investee the investee’s liquidity debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash 

business combinations the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations 

although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain and unpredictable unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results examples of critical estimates used in valuing certain of the intangible assets and in determining the assets’ useful lives for the assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to 

• future expected cash flows from sales subscriptions and maintenance agreements and acquired developed technologies 

• the acquired companys trade name trademark and existing customer relationship as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademark will continue to be used in our product portfolio 

• expected costs to develop the inprocess research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed 

• uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed and 

• discount rates used to determine the present value of estimated future cash flows 

table of contents 

realizability of longlived assets we assess the realizability of our longlived assets and related intangible assets other than goodwill quarterly or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review significant underperformance of a business or product line relative to budget shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends and the results of past impairment reviews when such events or changes in circumstances occur we assess recoverability of these assets 

we assess recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows we would perform a discounted cash flow analysis to assess impairments on longlived assets 

the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model include the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows we also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite lives 

variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge impairment charges if any result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values 

income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability approach under this method deferred tax assets including those related to tax loss carryforwards and credits and deferred tax liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we recognize the tax benefit for an uncertain tax position when it meets the more likely than not threshold for recognition we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense 

a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be recovered the valuation allowance is determined by assessing both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable such assessment is required on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis significant judgment is required in determining whether the valuation allowance should be recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for or release of a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income 

as we continually strive to optimize our overall business model tax planning strategies may become feasible and prudent whereby management may determine that it is more likely than not that the netherlands canada california michigan and us capital loss deferred tax assets will be realized each quarter we will continue to evaluate the positive and negative evidence of our ability to utilize our global deferred tax assets 

loss contingencies  as described in part i item 3 “legal proceedings” and part ii item 8 note 10 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters due to inherent uncertainties related to these matters we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time until the final resolution of such matters there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations

overview of fiscal 2021 

• total net revenue was 379 billion during fiscal 2021 an increase of 16 compared to the prior fiscal year 

• recurring revenue as a percentage of net revenue was 97 for the fiscal year ending january 31 2021 compared to 96 for the same period in the prior fiscal year 

• net revenue retention rate “nr3” was within the range of 100 and 110 as of january 31 2021 and within the range of 110 and 120 as of january 31 2020 

• deferred revenue was 336 billion an increase of 12 compared to the prior fiscal year 

• remaining performance obligations shortterm and longterm deferred revenue plus unbilled deferred revenue “rpo” was 424 billion an increase of 19 compared to the fourth quarter in the prior fiscal year 

• current remaining performance obligations were 274 billion an increase of 16 compared to the prior fiscal year 

revenue analysis 

during fiscal 2021 net revenue increased 16 as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to a 26 increase in subscription revenue the increase in subscription revenue was partially offset by a 53 decrease in maintenance revenue 

further discussion of the drivers of these results are discussed below under the heading “results of operations” 

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the united states and international regions including tech data corporation and its global affiliates collectively “tech data” and ingram micro inc “ingram micro” total sales to tech data accounted for 37 of autodesk’ total net revenue during fiscal 2021 and 35 of autodesk’s total net revenue during both fiscal 2020 and 2019 during both fiscal 2021 and 2020 ingram micro accounted for 10 of autodesks total net revenue and during fiscal 2019 ingram micro accounted for 11 of autodesk’s total net revenue our customers through tech data and ingram micro are the resellers and end users who purchase our software subscriptions and services should any of our agreements with tech data or ingram micro be terminated for any reason we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data or ingram micro would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue consequently we believe our business is not substantially dependent on tech data or ingram micro 

recurring revenue and net revenue retention rate 

in order to help better understand our financial performance we use several key performance metrics including recurring revenue and nr3 these metrics are key performance metrics and should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as these metrics are not intended to be combined with those items we use these metrics to monitor the strength of our recurring business we believe these metrics are useful to investors because they can help in monitoring the longterm health of our business our determination and presentation of these metrics may differ from that of other companies the presentation of these metrics is meant to be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or in isolation from our financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap please refer to the “glossary of terms” for the definitions of these metrics in part i item 1 business 

the following table outlines our recurring revenue metric for the fiscal years ended january 31 2021 2020 and 2019

foreign currency analysis 

we generate a significant amount of our revenue in the united states japan germany finland and the united kingdom 

the following table shows the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on our net revenue and total spend 

  

1 please refer to the “glossary of terms” in part i item 1 business for the definitions of our constant currency growth rates 

changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue total spend and income loss from operations in future periods we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on a portion of the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions but do not attempt to completely mitigate the impact of fluctuations of such foreign currency against the us dollar 

remaining performance obligations 

rpo represents deferred revenue and contractually stated or committed orders under early renewal and multiyear billing plans for subscription services license and maintenance for which the associated deferred revenue has not yet been recognized unbilled deferred revenue is not included as a receivable or deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets see part ii item 8 note 2 “revenue recognition” for more details on autodesks performance obligations 



  

rpo consisted of the following 



we expect that the amount of rpo will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons including the specific timing duration and size of customer subscription and support agreements varying billing cycles of such agreements the specific timing of customer renewals and foreign currency fluctuations historically we have had increased ebas sale activity in our fourth fiscal quarter and this seasonality may effect the relative value of our fourth quarter billings and rpo 

balance sheet and cash flow items 

at january 31 2021 we had 18572 million in cash and marketable securities our cash flow from operations increased to 14372 million for the fiscal year ended january 31 2021 from 14151 million for the fiscal year ended january 31 2020 we repurchased 26 million shares of our common stock for 5494 million during fiscal 2021 comparatively we repurchased 27 million shares of our common stock for 4555 million during fiscal 2020 further discussion regarding the balance sheet and cash flow activities are discussed below under the heading “liquidity and capital resources”

results of operations 

impacts of covid19 to autodesk’s business 

we are continuing to conduct business during the covid19 pandemic with substantial modifications to employee travel employee work locations and virtualization postponement or cancellation of certain sales and marketing events among other modifications we have observed other companies as well as many governments continuing to take precautionary measures to address covid19 and they may take further actions that alter their normal business operations we continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners suppliers and stockholders 

in the fiscal quarter ended january 31 2021 we experienced usage levels above precovid19 levels in most of asia pacific and continental europe usage rates in the united states and the united kingdom remain below precovid19 levels contributing to our revenue growth in the fourth fiscal quarter ended january 31 2021 was record ebas strong subscription renewal rates accelerating digital sales and continued sequential growth in new business in our target markets both architecture engineering and construction “aec” and manufacturing “mfg” experienced growth as compared to the fourth fiscal quarter in the prior year 

we also took action to support our customers during the fiscal year ended january 31 2021 and extended payment terms to 60 days through august 7 2020 offering free commercial use of our cloud collaboration products through june 2020 and delayed the transition from multiuser licenses to nameduser licenses from may 2020 to august 2020 to minimize customer disruption further we deferred a 20 maintenance price increase from may 2020 to august 2020 to give customers additional time to consider a subscription agreement 

given the evolving business environment as a result of covid19 we are actively managing our spending reducing travel and entertainment expense monitoring our hiring rate and rationalizing our marketing spend we will continue to invest in critical areas such as rd construction and digitizing the company to ensure our future success as we come out of the pandemic 

we believe our investment in cloud products and a subscription business model backed by a strong balance sheet give us a robust foundation to successfully navigate the economic challenges of covid19 the extent of the impact on our business in fiscal 2022 and beyond will depend on several factors including the full duration and the extent of the pandemic actions taken by governments businesses and consumers in response to the pandemic speed and timing of economic recovery our billings and renewal rates including new business close rates rate of multiyear contracts pace of closing larger transactions and new unit volume growth and effect of the pandemic on margins and cash flow all of these factors continue to evolve and remain uncertain at this time and some of these factors are not within our control further discussion of the potential impacts of covid19 on our business can be found in part i item 1a “risk factors” 

net revenue by income statement presentation 

subscription revenue consists of our termbased product subscriptions cloud service offerings and flexible ebas revenue from these arrangements is predominately recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date our service is made available to customers and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 

maintenance revenue consists of renewal fees for existing maintenance plan agreements that were initially purchased with a perpetual software license under our maintenance plan customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades when and if available and technical support we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the term of the agreements which is generally one year 

other revenue consists of revenue from consulting training and other products and services and is recognized as the products are delivered and services are performed

 constant currency data not provided at this level 

we believe that international revenue will continue to comprise a majority of our net revenue unfavorable economic conditions in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue including in emerging economies such as brazil russia india and china may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies have significantly affected and could continue to significantly affect our financial results for a given period even though we hedge a portion of our current and projected revenue increases to the levels of political and economic unpredictability in the global market may impact our future financial results

interest and other expense net 

the following table sets forth the components of interest and other expense net 



interest and other expense net increased by 342 million during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 the increase was primarily due to an increase in impairments and negative measurement alternative adjustments on our strategic investment equity securities and a decrease in interest income offset by a decrease in interest expense as result of the payment in full of our term loan and an increase in marktomarket gains on marketable securities 

interest and other expense net increased by 305 million during fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 this was primarily driven by losses in the current year versus gains in the previous year on our strategic investment equity securities curtailment gains on our pension plans in the prior period and an increase in interest expense resulting from our term loan entered into on december 17 2018 in aggregate principal amount of 5000 million which has been paid in full as of january 31 2020 the increase in interest and other expense net was partially offset by marktomarket gains in the current year versus losses in the prior year on marketable securities 

interest expense and investment income fluctuates based on average cash marketable securities and debt balances average maturities and interest rates 

gains and losses on foreign currency are primarily due to the impact of remeasuring foreign currency transactions and net monetary assets into the functional currency of the corresponding entity the amount of the gain or loss on foreign currency is driven by the volume of foreign currency transactions and the foreign currency exchange rates for the year 

provision for income taxes 

we account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse furthermore on january 22 2018 the fasb released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” provisions of the tcja the gilti provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations the company has elected to recognize any potential gilti obligations as an expense in the period it is incurred 

income tax benefit was 6615 million and expense was 803 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020 relative to pretax income of 5467 million and 2948 million respectively for the same periods the tax benefit for fiscal 2021 consists primarily of the us valuation allowance release us foreign derived intangible income permanent benefit sharebased compensation deductions and generation of federal tax credits offset by foreign tax expense including withholding tax tax expense for fiscal 2020 consisted of foreign tax expense including withholding tax and us tax amortization on indefinitelived intangibles offset by a tax benefit from the release of singapore valuation allowance 

a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be recovered the valuation allowance is determined by assessing both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable such assessment is required on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis significant judgment is required in determining whether the valuation allowance should be recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income 

table of contents 

in fiscal 2016 we considered cumulative losses in the united states from our business model transition as a significant source of negative evidence considering this negative evidence we determined that it was more likely than not that we would not realize the us deferred tax assets and recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets similarly in fiscal 2018 we recorded a valuation allowance against our singapore deferred tax assets due to significant negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses foreign operations in the netherlands and canada that generated interest expense and future creditable research in excess of earnings respectively also resulted in the historic recording of a full valuation under the more likely than not realizability criteria 

we released our singapore valuation allowance in fiscal 2020 due to positive evidence in the form of cumulative earnings resulting in a 420 million noncash benefit to earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we released the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the us resulting in a 6790 million noncash benefit to earnings we released the us valuation allowance in fiscal 2021 due to the following positive evidence 

• recent history of worldwide pretax earnings including cumulative earnings on a worldwide basis as of fiscal 2021 

• recent history of us taxable income 

• forecast of worldwide and us pretax earnings including a forecast of cumulative earnings in the us jurisdiction 

• forecast of us taxable income 

• reversal of deferred tax liabilities 

we have retained a valuation allowance against california deferred tax assets and deferred tax assets that will convert into a capital loss upon reversal as we do not have sufficient income of the appropriate character to benefit these deferred tax assets 

as we continually strive to optimize our overall business model tax planning strategies may become feasible whereby management may determine based on all available evidence both positive and negative that it is more likely than not that the netherlands canada california michigan and capital loss deferred tax assets will be realized 

as of january 31 2021 we had 1980 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which 317 million would reduce our valuation allowance if recognized the remaining 1663 million would impact the effective tax rate it is possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next 12 months for an audit settlement of approximately 82 million 

our future effective annual tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate changes in valuation allowances level of profit before tax accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits and changes in tax laws a significant amount of our earnings is generated by our european and asia pacific subsidiaries our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates

other financial information 

in addition to our results determined under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” discussed above we believe the following nongaap measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the fiscal years ended january 31 2021 2020 and 2019 our gross profit gross margin income loss from operations operating margin net income loss diluted net income loss per share and diluted shares used in per share calculation on a gaap and nongaap basis were as follows in millions except for gross margin operating margin and per share data 

   

for our internal budgeting and resource allocation process and as a means to provide consistency in periodtoperiod comparisons we use nongaap measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis these nongaap measures do not include certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results we also use nongaap measures in making operating decisions because we believe those measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our earning potential and performance for management by excluding certain benefits credits expenses and charges that may not be indicative of our core business operating results for the reasons set forth below we believe these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors both because 1 they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and 2 they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business this allows investors and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management compare financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the longterm performance of our core business we also use some of these measures for purposes of determining companywide incentive compensation 

there are limitations in using nongaap financial measures because nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies the nongaap financial measures included above are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results in addition they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the nongaap financial measures we compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a gaap basis as well as a nongaap basis and also by providing gaap measures in our public disclosures the presentation of nongaap financial information is meant to be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or in isolation from the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap we urge investors to review the reconciliation of our nongaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures included below and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business

3 fiscal year 2019 balances previously presented in discrete tax provision items 

our nongaap financial measures may exclude the following 

stockbased compensation expenses we exclude stockbased compensation expenses from nongaap measures primarily because they are noncash expenses and management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods moreover because of varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under fasb asc topic 718 we believe excluding stockbased compensation expenses allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies 

amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangibles we incur amortization of acquisitionrelated developed technology and purchased intangibles in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangibles is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions management finds it useful to exclude these variable charges from our cost of revenues to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangible assets will recur in future periods 

ceo transition costs we exclude amounts paid to the company’s former ceos upon departure under the terms of their transition agreements including severance payments acceleration of restricted stock units and continued vesting of performance stock units and legal fees incurred with the transition also excluded from our nongaap measures are recruiting costs related to the search for a new ceo these costs represent nonrecurring expenses and are not indicative of our ongoing operating expenses we further believe that excluding the ceo transition costs from our nongaap results is useful to investors in that it allows for periodoverperiod comparability 

goodwill impairment this is a noncash charge to write down goodwill to fair value when there was an indication that the asset was impaired as explained above management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

restructuring and other exit costs net these expenses are associated with realigning our business strategies based on current economic conditions in connection with these restructuring actions or other exit actions we recognize costs related to termination benefits for former employees whose positions were eliminated the closure of facilities and cancellation of certain contracts we exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing business and operating results we believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses

acquisitionrelated costs we exclude certain acquisitionrelated costs including due diligence costs professional fees in connection with an acquisition certain financing costs and certain integrationrelated expenses these expenses are unpredictable and dependent on factors that may be outside of our control and unrelated to the continuing operations of the acquired business or our company in addition the size and complexity of an acquisition which often drives the magnitude of acquisitionrelated costs may not be indicative of such future costs we believe excluding acquisitionrelated costs facilitates the comparison of our financial results to the companys historical operating results and to other companies in our industry 

loss gain on strategic investments and dispositions we exclude gains and losses related to our strategic investments and dispositions of strategic investments purchased intangibles and businesses from our nongaap measures primarily because management finds it useful to exclude these variable gains and losses on these investments and dispositions in assessing our financial results included in these amounts are noncash unrealized gains and losses on the derivative components dividends received realized gains and losses on the sales or losses on the impairment of these investments and gain and loss on dispositions we believe excluding these items is useful to investors because these excluded items do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business and these losses or gains were incurred in connection with strategic investments and dispositions which do not occur regularly 

discrete tax provision items we exclude the gaap tax provision including discrete items from the nongaap measure of net income loss and include a nongaap tax provision based upon the projected annual nongaap effective tax rate discrete tax items include income tax expenses or benefits that do not relate to ordinary income from continuing operations in the current fiscal year unusual or infrequently occurring items or the tax impact of certain stockbased compensation examples of discrete tax items include but are not limited to certain changes in judgment and changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years certain costs related to business combinations certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets or changes in tax law management believes this approach assists investors in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations we believe the exclusion of these discrete tax items provides investors with useful supplemental information about our operational performance 

establishment release of a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets this is a noncash charge to record or to release a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets as explained above management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various cash expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

income tax effects on the difference between gaap and nongaap costs and expenses the income tax effects that are excluded from the nongaap measures relate to the tax impact on the difference between gaap and nongaap expenses primarily due to stockbased compensation amortization of purchased intangibles and restructuring charges and other exit costs benefits for gaap and nongaap measures 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of cash is from the sale of our software and related services our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employeerelated expenses such as compensation and benefits as well as general operating expenses for marketing facilities and overhead costs longterm cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following the acquisition of businesses software products or technologies complementary to our business repayment of debt common stock repurchases and capital expenditures including the purchase and implementation of internaluse software applications 

at january 31 2021 our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 186 billion and net accounts receivable of 6431 million our marketable securities include 810 million of debt and equity securities that are held in a rabbi trust under nonqualified deferred compensation plans on february 23 2021 we announced the pending acquisition of storm uk holdco limited the parent of innovyze inc for approximately 10 billion the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals and is expected to close in our first quarter of fiscal 2021 we intend to fund this acquisition with readily available cash see part ii item 8 note 17 “subsequent events” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

on december 17 2018 autodesk entered into a credit agreement the “credit agreement” for an unsecured revolving loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of 6500 million with an option to request increases in the amount of the credit facility by up to an additional 3500 million the maturity date on the line of credit facility is december 2023 at january 31 2021 autodesk had no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit as of march 19 2021 we have no amounts outstanding

as of january 31 2021 we have 165 billion aggregate principal amount of longterm notes payable outstanding see part ii item 8 note 8 “borrowing arrangements” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

our cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally our primary commercial banking relationship is with citigroup and its global affiliates in addition citibank na an affiliate of citigroup is one of the lead lenders and agent in the syndicate of our 6500 million line of credit 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances are concentrated in a few locations around the world with substantial amounts held outside of the united states as of january 31 2021 approximately 59 of our total cash or cash equivalents and marketable securities are located in foreign jurisdictions and that percentage will fluctuate subject to business needs there are several factors that can impact our ability to utilize foreign cash balances such as foreign exchange restrictions foreign regulatory restrictions or adverse tax costs the tcja included a mandatory onetime tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and generally eliminated us taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions in future periods as a result earnings in foreign jurisdictions are generally available for distribution to the united states with little to no incremental us taxes we regularly review our capital structure and consider a variety of potential financing alternatives and planning strategies to ensure we have the proper liquidity available in the locations in which it is needed we expect to meet our liquidity needs through or in combination of current cash balances ongoing cash flows and external borrowings 

cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the risks detailed in part i item 1a titled “risk factors” additionally as a result of the covid19 pandemic we extended contract payment terms for up to 60 days for all customers and partners for new orders and renewals placed directly with autodesk this payment terms extension program began on march 16 2020 and ended on august 7 2020 we currently expect to have sufficient liquidity to manage through the covid19 pandemic but we will continue to monitor the impact of potential disruptions beyond our control based on our current business plan planned acquisitions and revenue prospects we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of this annual report 

our revenue earnings cash flows receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for which we have put in place foreign currency contracts as part of our risk management strategy see part ii item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion 



net cash provided by operating activities of 144 billion for fiscal 2021 primarily consisted of 12082 million of our net income adjusted for 2176 million noncash items such as deferred income tax including the release of our deferred tax valuation allowance stockbased compensation expense and depreciation amortization and accretion expense the increase in cash provided by working capital was primarily due to a net increase in deferred revenue of 3444 million driven by an increase in product subscriptions and eba offerings and a decrease in maintenance subscriptions and an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities of 1296 million primarily due to the timing of payments for operating expenses and accruals for employee related costs 

net cash provided by operating activities of 142 billion for fiscal 2020 consisted of 7120 million of cash flow provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities 4886 million of noncash expenses including stockbased compensation expense depreciation amortization and accretion expense and our net income of 2145 million 

net cash used in investing activities was 4039 million for fiscal 2021 and was primarily due to business combinations net of cash acquired capital expenditures purchases of strategic investments and purchases of marketable securities these cash outflows were partially offset by maturities of marketable securities

at january 31 2021 our shortterm investment portfolio had an estimated fair value of 850 million and a cost basis of 685 million the portfolio fair value consisted of 810 million of shortterm trading securities that were invested in a defined set of mutual funds as directed by the participants in our deferred compensation plan see note 7 “deferred compensation” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at january 31 2021 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 



 

1 this table generally excludes amounts already recorded on the balance sheet as current liabilities certain purchase obligations as discussed below long term deferred revenue and amounts related to income tax accruals for uncertain tax positions since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities see part ii item 8 note 5 “income taxes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months in addition we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

table of contents 

we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees including limited product warranties historically costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant but because potential future costs are highly variable we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations 

issuer purchases of equity securities 

autodesk’s stock repurchase program provides autodesk with the ability to offset the dilution from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and reduce shares outstanding over time and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders under the share repurchase program autodesk may repurchase shares from time to time in open market transactions privately negotiated transactions accelerated share repurchase programs tender offers or by other means the share repurchase program does not have an expiration date and the pace and timing of repurchases will depend on factors such as cash generation from operations available surplus the volume of employee stock plan activity remaining shares available in the authorized pool cash requirements for acquisitions economic and market conditions stock price and legal and regulatory requirements 

during the three and 12 months ended january 31 2021 we repurchased 05 million and 26 million shares of our common stock respectively at january 31 2021 121 million shares remained available for repurchase under the repurchase program approved by the board of directors this program does not have a fixed expiration date see part ii item 8 note 11 “stock repurchase program” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our revenue earnings cash flows receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency volatility that exists as part of our ongoing business operations we utilize cash flow hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions in addition we use balance sheet hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables and payables as of january 31 2021 and 2020 we had open cash flow and balance sheet hedge contracts with future settlements generally within one to 12 months contracts were primarily denominated in euros japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars singapore dollars swiss francs swedish krona and czech koruna we do not enter into foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes the notional amount of our option and forward contracts was 157 billion and 172 billion at january 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue and operating expenses of certain anticipated transactions a sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january 31 2021 indicated that a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 31 2021 and 2020 would increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by 1186 million and 1588 million respectively a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the dollar from its value at january 31 2021 and 2020 would decrease the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by 1492 million and 1192 million respectively 

interest rate risk 

interest rate movements affect both the interest income we earn on our shortterm investments and the market value of certain longer term securities at january 31 2021 we had 8123 million of cash equivalents and marketable securities including 850 million classified as shortterm marketable securities if interest rates were to move up by 50 or 100 basis points over a 12month period the market value change of our marketable securities would not have a material impact on our results of operations 

other market risk 

from time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies privately held company investments generally are considered inherently risky the technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies see part ii item 8 note 3 “financial instruments” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding these strategic investments

product development and introduction 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware operating systems and software in addition our customers’ requirements and preferences rapidly evolve as do their expectations of the performance of our software and services to keep pace with these changes we maintain a vigorous program of new product development to address demands in the marketplace for our products such as enabling more flexibility and sustainable outcomes 

the software industry has undergone a transition from developing and selling perpetual licenses and onpremises products to subscriptions and cloudenabled technologies to address this shift autodesk made a strategic decision to shift its business model from selling perpetual licenses to selling subscriptions subscription plan offerings are designed to give our customers increased flexibility with how they use our products and service offerings and to attract a broader range of customers such as projectbased users and small businesses subscriptions represent a combined hybrid offering of desktop software and cloud functionality which provides a deviceindependent collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders we discontinued the sale of new commercial licenses of most individual software products in 2016 additionally in june 2017 we commenced a program to incentivize maintenance plan customers to move to subscription plan offerings maintenancetosubscription m2s while at the same time increasing maintenance plan pricing over time for customers that remain on maintenance plans since launching the program a substantial majority of maintenance plan customers have converted to subscription plan offerings we will be retiring maintenance offerings as of august 7 2021 customers will have a oneyear period starting august 7 2020 to convert a maintenance seat to subscription plan offerings additionally in order to offer better

service to our customers we are transitioning our existing customers from serial numbers to named users we migrated our single user subscriptions in fiscal 2020 and are planning to transition multiuser subscriptions to named users in fiscal 2021 

we dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to further enhance our existing products and to create new solutions and technologies to expand our market opportunity and deliver additional automation and insights to our customers for example in fiscal 2020 we continued and expanded our investments in construction we continued to make investments in the traditional data creation tools to support the design and preconstruction phases while expanding our investment in the areas of site execution with process and project management construction cloud tools recognizing the value of data continuity across the construction lifecycle of design building and operations we made investments in the preconstruction and site execution phases of the project through our cloudbased tools to connect the phases of construction upstream with design we invested in and announced our construction cloud project delivery platform that allows individuals teams and projects to be connected across all phases in a common data platform and increase efficiencies we anticipate ongoing investments in construction that support preconstruction site execution as well as the handover phase of the project and will continue to invest in connecting workflows and data across the ecosystem of the project 

our software is primarily developed internally however we also use independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities additionally we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing or licensing products and technology from third parties we continually review these investments to ensure that we are generating sufficient revenue or gaining a competitive advantage to justify their costs 

  

the majority of our research and product development is performed in the united states china singapore canada and the united kingdom however we employ experienced software developers in many of our other locations translation and localization of our products are performed in several local markets principally singapore and ireland we generally localize and translate our products into german french italian spanish russian japanese korean and simplified and traditional chinese 

we plan to continue managing significant product development operations internationally over the next several years we believe that our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize product development lower costs and integrate local market knowledge into our development activities we continually assess the significant costs and challenges including intellectual property protection against the benefits of our international development activities

marketing and sales 

we sell our products and services globally primarily through indirect channels consisting of distributors and resellers to a lesser extent we also transact directly with our enterprise and named account customers and with customers through our online autodesk branded store our indirect channel model includes both a twotiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a onetiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers we have a network of approximately 1500 resellers and distributors worldwide for fiscal 2020  approximately 70 of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers 

  

we anticipate that our channel mix will continue to change particularly as we scale our online autodesk branded store business and our largest accounts shift towards directonly business models importantly we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the near future we employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our reseller channel with our business strategies our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller networks the loss of or a significant reduction in business with any one of our major distributors or large resellers could harm our business see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion 

sales through our largest distributor tech data corporation and its global affiliates collectively tech data accounted for 35  35  and 31 of our net revenue for fiscal years ended january 31 2020  2019  and 2018  respectively ingram micro inc ingram micro our second largest distributor accounted for 10  11  and 8 of autodesks total net revenue for fiscal years ended january 31 2020  2019  and 2018  respectively we believe our business is not substantially dependent on either tech data or ingram micro should any of the agreements between us and tech data or ingram micro be terminated for any reason we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data or ingram micro would

be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue no other distributor reseller or direct customer accounted for 10 or more of our revenue 

our customerrelated operations are divided into three geographic regions the americas europe middle east and africa “emea” and asia pacific “apac” each geographic region is supported by global marketing and sales organizations these organizations develop and manage overall marketing and sales programs and work closely with a network of domestic and international sales offices we believe that international sales will continue to comprise the majority of our total net revenue adverse economic conditions and currency exchange rates in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue including emerging economies may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance our international operations and sales subject us to a variety of risks see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion 

we also work directly with reseller and distributor sales organizations computer manufacturers other software developers and peripherals manufacturers in cooperative advertising promotions and tradeshow presentations we employ massmarketing techniques such as webcasts seminars telemarketing direct mailings sponsorships advertising in business and trade journals and social media we have a worldwide user group organization and we have created online user communities dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products and services 

we generate revenue primarily through various offerings that provide recurring revenue under our subscription plan customers can use our software anytime anywhere and get access to the latest updates to previous versions through termbased product subscriptions cloud service offerings and enterprise business agreements with the discontinuation of the sale of perpetual licenses we have transitioned away from selling a mix of perpetual licenses and maintenance plans in favor of a consolidated subscription model however our customers who have previously purchased a perpetual use license for the most recent version of the underlying product are able to renew a previously purchased maintenance plan until maintenance offerings are retired as of august 7 2021 that provides them with unspecified upgrades when and if available and receive online support during the term of their maintenance contract 

customer and reseller support 

we provide technical support and training to customers through a multitiered support model augmented by direct programs designed to address certain specific customer needs most of our customers receive support and training from the resellers and distributors from which they purchased subscriptions or licenses for our products or services with autodesk in turn providing second tier support to the resellers and distributors other customers are supported directly via selfservice using the autodesk knowledge network which guides customers to answers in our online support assets support forums webinars or to support representatives using different modalities such as social media phone email and webchat we also support our resellers and distributors through technical product training sales training classes webinars and other knowledge sharing programs

climate change 

in addressing the global challenges posed by climate change we make it possible for our customers to innovate and respond to associated changes in regulation building code physical climate parameters and other climaterelated developments this effort can directly and indirectly create more demand for existing and new autodesk products and services in the short and longterm furthermore our leadership is committed to taking climate action and that commitment goes handinhand with our values and reputation in the marketplace 

climate change management actions 

to drive continued progress and meet growing demand we continue to expand the solutions education and support we offer helping customers secure a competitive advantage for a lowcarbon future by designing highperformance buildings resilient cities and infrastructure and more efficient transportation and products to continue to grow this market we provide software and support to early stage entrepreneurs and startup companies who are designing clean technologies we plan to expand these offerings in the future based upon demand and opportunity in response to challenges posed by climate change 

internally we are investing in best practices to mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions and climate change risk through investments in renewable energy energy efficiency disaster management and recovery strategies and materials innovation we are on track to meet our sciencebased greenhouse gas reduction target of 43 absolute emissions by fiscal 2020 and have announced a new commitment to being netzero emissions by the end of fiscal 2021 our results will be published in our fiscal 2020 sustainability report 

climate change governance 

with oversight from our ceo the sustainability  foundation team has direct responsibility for setting and implementing our corporate sustainability strategy including our climate change strategy 

emissions performance  other key performance indicators 

by end of fiscal 2019 autodesk had reduced its net greenhouse gas emissions for its operational boundary by 41 from our fiscal year 2009 baseline to 178000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent this reduction was accomplished through increased investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency in our global real estate portfolio and investments with our customers to create carbon avoidance projects that generate verified emission reduction credits more information about our sustainability commitment can be found in our annual sustainability reports which we have published on our website since 2008 our fiscal 2020 sustainability report will be published in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 

philanthropy 

the autodesk foundation the foundation a privately funded 501c3 charity organization established and solely funded by us leads our philanthropic efforts the purpose of the foundation is twofold to support employees to create a better world at work at home and in the community by matching employees volunteer time andor donations to nonprofit organizations and to support organizations and individuals using design to drive positive social and environmental impact in the latter case we use grant funding software donations and training to accomplish this goal selecting the most impactful and innovative organizations around the world thus leading to a better future for our planet on our behalf the foundation also administers a discounted software donation program to nonprofit organizations social and environmental entrepreneurs and others who are developing design solutions that will shape a more sustainable future

customers one of our key strategies is to maintain an openarchitecture design of our software products to facilitate thirdparty development of complementary products and industryspecific software solutions this approach enables customers and thirdparties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses we offer several programs that provide strategic investment funding technological platforms user communities technical support forums and events to developers who develop addon applications for our products for example we have created our web services platform autodesk forge the forge platform includes web services that enable software developers to rapidly develop the next generation of applications and experiences that will power the future of making things forge facilitates the development of a single connected ecosystem for integrating autodesk applications with other enterprise web and mobile solutions 

competition 

the markets for our products are highly competitive are subject to rapid change and can have complex interdependencies between many of the larger businesses we strive to increase our competitive separation by investing in research and development allowing us to bring new products to market and create exciting new versions of existing products that offer compelling efficiencies for our customers we also compete through investments in marketing and sales to more effectively reach new customers and better serve existing customers 

our competitors include large global publicly traded companies small geographically focused firms startup firms and solutions produced inhouse by their users our primary global competitors include adobe systems incorporated aveva group plc bentley systems inc dassault systèmes sa and its subsidiary dassault systèmes solidworks corp intergraph corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of hexagon ab msc software corporation nemetschek ag oracle corporation procore technologies inc ptc inc 3d systems corporation siemens plm and trimble navigation limited among others 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing power with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the industry continues to undergo a platform shift from the personal computer to cloud and mobile computing this shift further lowers barriers to entry and poses a disruptive challenge to established software companies the design software market is characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete both from existing competitors and by entry of new competitors with innovative technologies competition is increasingly enhanced by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies and the possibility that competitors in one vertical segment may enter other vertical segments that we serve in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources than we do because of these and other factors competitive conditions in these industries are likely to continue to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which could harm our business see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion of risks regarding competition 

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to better serve customers by offering new products including cloud and mobile computing products whether by internal development or acquisition and to continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to ease of use reliability performance range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation price and training 

intellectual property and licenses 

we maintain an active program to legally protect our investment in technology through intellectual property rights we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions the nature and extent of legal protection associated with each such intellectual property right depends on among other things the type of intellectual property right and the given jurisdiction in which such right arises we believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business 

nonetheless our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws and enforcement of the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws enforcement of intellectual property rights against alleged infringers can sometimes lead to costly litigation and counterclaims our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business 

from time to time we receive claims alleging infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights including patents disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to among other things costly litigation or product shipment delays which could harm our business

we retain ownership of software we develop our combined hybrid offerings include both desktop software and cloud functionality desktop software is licensed to users pursuant to ‘click through’ or signed license agreements containing restrictions on duplication disclosure and transfer cloud software and associated services are provided to users pursuant to online or signed terms of service agreements containing restrictions on access and use 

we believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our intellectual property and the rapid ongoing technological changes in both the computer hardware and software industries we must rely principally upon software engineering and marketing skills to continually maintain and enhance our competitive market position 

while we have recovered some revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of our software solutions we are unable to measure the full extent to which unauthorized use of our software products exists we believe however that unauthorized use of our software is and can be expected to be a persistent problem that negatively impacts our revenue and financial results we believe that our transition from perpetual use software licenses to a subscriptionbased business model combined with the change from desktop to cloudbased computing will shift the incentives and means by which software is used without authorization 

in addition through various licensing arrangements we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others we expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing arrangements in the future as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions to support continued development and sales of our products and services some of these licensing arrangements require or may require royalty payments and other licensing fees the amount of these payments and fees may depend on various factors including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments offsetting considerations if any and the degree of use of the licensed technology 

see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion of risks related to protecting our intellectual property 

production and suppliers 

the production of our software products and services involves duplication or hosting of software media the way that we deliver software has evolved during our business model transition for certain cloudbased products we use a combination of colocated hosting facilities and increasingly amazon web services and to a lesser degree other infrastructureasaservice providers we offer customers an electronic software download option for both initial product fulfillment and subsequent product updates customers who choose electronic fulfillment receive the latest version of the software from our vendor’s secure servers customers may also obtain our software through media such as dvds and usb flash drives available from multiple sources the purchase of media and the transfer of the software programs onto media for distribution to customers are performed by us and by licensed subcontractors packaging materials are produced to our specifications by outside sources production is performed in leased facilities operated by independent thirdparty contractors to date we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the production of our software and documentation 

employees 

as of january 31 2020  we employed approximately 10100 people none of our employees in the united states are represented by a labor union in certain foreign countries our employees are represented by work councils we have never experienced any work stoppages and believe our employee relations are good reliance upon employees in other countries entails various risks and changes in these foreign countries such as government instability or regulation unfavorable to foreignowned businesses which could negatively impact our business in the future

 item 1a risk factors 

  

we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks a number of which are beyond our control in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following discussion highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on our business financial condition and future results of operations if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted causing the trading price of our common stock to decline in addition these risks and uncertainties may impact the “forwardlooking” statements described elsewhere in this form 10k and in the documents incorporated herein by reference they could affect our actual results of operations causing them to differ materially from those expressed in “forwardlooking” statements 

global economic and political conditions may further impact our industries business and financial results 

our overall performance depends largely upon domestic and worldwide economic and political conditions the united states and other international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services restricted credit poor liquidity decreased government spending reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy these economic conditions can occur abruptly for example the recent coronavirus disease covid19 has caused additional uncertainty in the global economy the extent to which covid19 may impact our financial condition or results of operations is currently uncertain and will depend on developments such as the impact on our customers vendors distributors and resellers due to our subscriptionbased business model the effect of covid19 may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods if at all if economic growth in countries where we do business slows or if such countries experience further economic recessions customers may delay or reduce technology

purchases our customers include government entities including the us federal government and if spending cuts impede the ability of governments to purchase our products and services our revenue could decline in addition a number of our customers rely directly and indirectly on government spending   

as described elsewhere in this risk factors section we are dependent on international revenue and operations and are subject to related risks of conducting business globally geopolitical trends toward nationalism and protectionism and the weakening or dissolution of international trade pacts may increase the cost of or otherwise interfere with conducting business these trends have increased levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and may increase the volatility of global financial markets the impact of such developments on the global economy remains uncertain political instability or adverse political developments in any of the countries in which we do business could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

a financial sector credit crisis could impair credit availability and the financial stability of our customers including our distribution partners and channels a disruption in the financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking partners on which we rely for operating cash management any of these events could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

our strategy to develop and introduce new products and services exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance costs related to product defects and large expenditures each of which may not result in additional net revenue or could result in decreased net revenue 

rapid technological changes as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences characterize the software industry just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry over 30 years ago the software industry has undergone a transition from developing and selling perpetual licenses and onpremises products to subscriptions and cloud enabled technologies customers are also reconsidering how they purchase software products which requires us to constantly evaluate our business model and strategy in response we are focused on providing solutions to enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative on their projects we devote significant resources to the development of new technologies in addition we frequently introduce new business models or methods that require a considerable investment of technical and financial resources such as our introduction of flexible subscription and service offerings for example in fiscal 2021 we are transitioning multisubscription plans to named user plans it is uncertain whether these strategies including our product and pricing changes will prove successful or whether we will be able to develop the necessary infrastructure and business models more quickly than our competitors we are making such investments through further development and enhancement of our existing products and services as well as through acquisitions such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs and could result in decreased net revenue or profitability if we are not able to meet customer requirements either with respect to our software or the manner in which we provide such products or if we are not able to adapt our business model to meet our customers requirements our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted 

in particular a critical component of our growth strategy is to have customers of our autocad and autocad lt products expand their portfolios to include our other offerings and cloudbased functionality we want customers using individual autodesk products to expand their portfolio with our other offerings and cloudbased functionality and we are taking steps to accelerate this migration at times sales of our autocad and autocad lt or individual autodesk flagship products have decreased without a corresponding increase in industry collections or cloudbased functionality revenue or without purchases of customer seats to our industry collections should this continue our results of operations will be adversely affected 

our executive management team must act quickly continuously and with vision given the rapidly changing customer expectations and technology advancements inherent in the software industry the extensive and complex efforts required to create useful and widely accepted products and the rapid evolution of cloud computing mobile devices new computing platforms and other technologies such as consumer products although we have articulated a strategy that we believe will fulfill these challenges if we fail to execute properly on that strategy or adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve we may fail to meet our customers expectations fail to compete with our competitors products and technology and lose the confidence of our channel partners and employees this in turn could adversely affect our business and financial performance

our business could suffer as a result of risks costs charges and integration risks associated with strategic acquisitions and investments such as the recent acquisitions of assemble systems inc plangrid inc and buildingconnected inc 

we regularly acquire or invest in businesses software solutions and technologies that are complementary to our business through acquisitions strategic alliances or equity or debt investments for example we recently acquired assemble systems plangrid and buildingconnected the risks associated with such acquisitions include among others the difficulty of assimilating solutions operations and personnel inheriting liabilities such as intellectual property infringement claims the failure to realize anticipated revenue and cost projections the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business in accordance with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the diversion of managements time and attention 

in addition such acquisitions and investments involve other risks such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may not be successful in overcoming such risks and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business in addition such acquisitions and investments have in the past and may in the future contribute to potential fluctuations in our quarterly financial results these fluctuations could arise from transactionrelated costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or writeoffs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments these costs or charges could negatively impact our financial results for a given period cause quarter to quarter variability in our financial results or negatively impact our financial results for several future periods 

we are dependent on international revenue and operations exposing us to significant regulatory global economic intellectual property collections currency exchange rate taxation political instability and other risks which could adversely impact our financial results 

we are dependent on our international operations for a significant portion of our revenue international net revenue represented 66 of our net revenue in both fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively our international revenue including that from emerging economies is subject to general economic and political conditions in foreign markets including conditions in foreign markets resulting from economic and political conditions in the us our revenue is also impacted by the relative geographical and country mix of our revenue over time at times these factors adversely impact our international revenue and consequently our business as a whole our dependency on international revenue makes us much more exposed to global economic and political trends which can negatively impact our financial results even if our results in the us are strong for a particular period 

we anticipate that our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue and as we expand our international development sales and marketing expertise will provide significant support to our overall efforts in countries outside of the us

some of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above 

the brexit vote has exacerbated and may further exacerbate many of the risks and uncertainties described above the united kingdom officially left the european union pursuant to brexit on january 31 2020 with a transitional period set to end on december 31 2020 the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union could among other potential outcomes adversely affect the tax tax treaty banking operational legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject the withdrawal could also among other potential outcomes create currency volatility disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and significantly disrupt trade between the united kingdom and the european union and other parties while the united kingdom left the european union as of january 31 2020 it has until december 31 2020 to negotiate a new trade agreement addressing customs and trade matters further uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the united kingdom economy the european union economies and the other economies in which we operate 

in addition the current us administration has instituted or proposed changes to foreign trade policy including the negotiation or termination of trade agreements the imposition of tariffs on products imported from certain countries economic sanctions on individuals corporations or countries and other government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries in which we do business new or increased tariffs and other changes in us trade policy could trigger

retaliatory actions by affected countries and certain foreign governments including the chinese government have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain us manufactured goods the escalation of protectionist or retaliatory trade measures in either the united states or any other countries in which we do business such as a change in tariff structures export compliance or other trade policies may increase the cost of or otherwise interfere with conducting our business 

even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks 

security incidents may compromise the integrity of our or our customers’ offerings services data or intellectual property harm our reputation damage our competitiveness create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results 

as we digitize autodesk and use cloud and webbased technologies to leverage customer data to deliver the total customer experience we are exposed to increased security risks and the potential for unauthorized access to or improper use of our and our customers information like other software offerings and systems ours are vulnerable to security incidents we devote resources to maintain the security and integrity of our systems offerings services and applications online mobile and desktop we accomplish this by enhancing security features conducting penetration tests code hardening releasing security vulnerability updates and accelerating our incident response time despite these efforts we may not prevent security incidents and we may face delays or other difficulties in identifying or responding to security incidents 

hackers regularly have targeted our systems offerings services and applications and we expect them to do so in the future security incidents could disrupt the proper functioning of our systems solutions or services cause errors in the output of our customers work allow unauthorized access to sensitive data or intellectual property including proprietary or confidential information of ours or our customers or cause other destructive outcomes 

the risk of a security incident particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyber terrorists has increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased these threats include but are not limited to identity theft unauthorized access dns attacks wireless network attacks viruses and worms advanced persistent threat apt application centric attacks peertopeer attacks phishing malicious file uploads backdoor trojans and distributed denial of service ddos attacks in addition third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees vendors partners or users to disclose information to gain access to our data or our users’ data and there is the risk of employee contractor or vendor error or malfeasance despite efforts to create security barriers to such threats it is impossible for us to entirely eliminate these risks 

if any of the foregoing security incidents were to occur or to be perceived to have occurred our reputation may suffer our competitive position may be diminished customers may stop paying for our solutions and services we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to evaluate and alleviate the security incident and in an effort to prevent further or additional incidents and we could face regulatory inquiry lawsuits and potential liability we could incur significant costs and liabilities including due to litigation indemnity obligations damages for contract breach penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations and costs for remediation and other incentives offered to customers or other business partners in an effort to maintain business relationships after a breach and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

we cannot assure you that any limitations of liability provisions in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim relating to a security breach or other security incident we also cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims related to a security breach or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business including our financial condition operating results and reputation 

the effect of the novel coronavirus covid19 on autodesk’s business is currently unknown but it may adversely affect our business and results of operations  

the impacts of the global emergence of covid19 on our business and financial results are currently unknown we are conducting business with substantial modifications to employee travel employee work locations and virtualization or cancellation of certain sales and marketing events among other modifications we have observed other companies as well as many governments taking precautionary and preemptive actions to address covid19 and they may take further actions that alter their normal business operations we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of

our employees customers partners suppliers and stockholders it is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business including the effects on our customers and prospects or on our financial results 

increasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws may impact our business or expose us to increased liability 

our strategy to digitize autodesk involves increasing our use of cloud and webbased technologies and applications to leverage customer data to improve our offerings for the benefit of our customers to accomplish this strategy we must collect and otherwise process customer data which may include personal data federal state and foreign government privacy and data security laws apply to the treatment of personal data governments regulators the plaintiffs’ bar privacy advocates and customers have increased their focus on how companies collect process use store share and transmit personal data 

the general data protection regulation gdpr is applicable in all european union member states and introduced new data protection requirements in the european union and substantial fines for noncompliance we have modified our privacy practices to comply with gdpr we have selfcertified under the euus privacy shield program and make use of model contractual clauses approved by the european commission in relation to the transfer of personal data from the european union to the united states the privacy shield and the european commission’s model contractual clauses are currently the subject of legal challenges in the european union however and it is unclear whether these will serve as appropriate means for us to transfer personal data from the european union to the united states we have also selfcertified to the swissus privacy shield program in relation to the transfer of personal data from switzerland to the united states this privacy shield program also may no longer be valid due to possible legal challenges additionally in june 2016 the united kingdom voted to leave the european union which could also lead to further legislative and regulatory changes with regard to personal data the united kingdom data protection act that substantially implements the gdpr became law in may 2018 it remains unclear however how united kingdom data protection laws or regulations will develop in the medium to longer term and how data transfers to and from the united kingdom will be regulated at the time if any that brexit is effectuated 

in addition in june 2018 california enacted the california consumer privacy act the ccpa which took effect in january 2020 the ccpa among other things gives california residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used the ccpa was amended in september 2018 and november 2019 and modifications were proposed in february 2020 it is unclear whether further modifications will be made to this law additionally in october 2019 the california department of justice published a notice of proposed rulemaking action with respect to draft regulations to implement the ccpa we cannot yet predict the impact of the ccpa on our business or operations but it may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in to comply 

the gdpr ccpa and other state and global laws and regulations increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data and we have and will continue to put in place additional processes and programs to demonstrate compliance new privacy laws and regulations are under development at the us federal and state level and many international jurisdictions any actual or perceived failure to comply with the gdpr the ccpa or other data privacy laws or regulations or related contractual or other obligations or any perceived privacy rights violation could lead to investigations claims and proceedings by governmental entities and private parties damages for contract breach and other significant costs penalties and other liabilities as well as harm to our reputation and market position  

additionally we store customer information and content and if our customers fail to comply with contractual obligations or applicable laws it could result in litigation or reputational harm to us the gdpr ccpa and other laws and selfregulatory codes may affect our ability to reach current and prospective customers to understand how our offerings and services are being used to respond to customer requests allowed under the laws and to implement our new business models effectively these new laws and regulations would similarly affect our competitors as well as our customers these requirements could impact demand for our offerings and services and result in more onerous contract obligations

we rely on third parties to provide us with a number of operational and technical services thirdparty security incidents could expose us to liability harm our reputation damage our competitiveness and adversely impact our financial performance 

we rely on third parties such as amazon web services to provide us with operational and technical services these third parties may have access to our systems provide hosting services or otherwise process data about us or our customers employees or partners any thirdparty security incident could compromise the integrity of or availability or result in the theft of data in addition our operations or the operations of our customers or partners could be negatively affected in the event of a security breach and could be subject to the loss or theft of confidential or proprietary information including source code unauthorized access to data and other confidential or proprietary information may be obtained through breakins network breaches by unauthorized parties employee theft or misuse or other misconduct if any of the foregoing were to occur or to be perceived to occur our reputation may suffer our competitive position may be diminished customers may buy fewer of our offerings and services we could face lawsuits and potential liability and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

delays in service from thirdparty service providers could expose us to liability harm our reputation damage our competitiveness and adversely impact our financial performance 

from time to time we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country for the provision of services and materials that we use in the operation of our business and production of our solutions the inability of such third parties to satisfy our requirements could disrupt our business operations or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy if any of these situations were to occur our reputation could be harmed we could be subject to thirdparty liability including under data protection and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

we are investing in resources to update and improve our information technology systems to digitize autodesk and support our customers should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing information technology systems disrupt our operations our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network and data center infrastructure technology systems and our websites for our development marketing operational support sales accounting and financial reporting activities we continually invest resources to update and improve these systems in order to meet the evolving requirements of our business and customers in particular our transition to cloudbased products and a subscriptiononly business model involves considerable investment in the development of technologies as well as backoffice systems for technical financial compliance and sales resources 

such improvements are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or may uncover problems with our existing technology systems unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in disruption in our business operations loss of customers loss of revenue errors in our accounting and financial reporting or damage to our reputation all of which could harm our business 

we may not be able to predict subscription renewal rates and their impact on our future revenue and operating results 

our customers are not obligated to renew their subscriptions for our offerings and they may elect not to renew we cannot assure renewal rates or the mix of subscriptions renewals customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate due to a number of factors including offering pricing competitive offerings customer satisfaction and reductions in customer spending levels or customer activity due to economic downturns or financial markets uncertainty if our customers do not renew their subscriptions or if they renew on less favorable terms our revenues may decline 

our software is highly complex and may contain undetected errors defects or vulnerabilities each of which could harm our business and financial performance 

the software solutions that we offer are complex and despite extensive testing and quality control may contain errors defects or vulnerabilities some errors defects and vulnerabilities in our software solutions may only be discovered after they have been released any errors defects or vulnerabilities could result in the need for corrective releases to our software solutions damage to our reputation loss of revenue an increase in subscription cancellations or lack of market acceptance of our offerings any of which would likely harm our business and financial performance

existing and increased competition and rapidly evolving technological changes may reduce our revenue and profits 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing devices with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the software industry has undergone a transition from developing and selling perpetual licenses and onpremises products to subscriptions and cloudenabled technologies  this shift further lowers barriers to entry and poses a disruptive challenge to established software companies the markets in which we compete are characterized by vigorous competition both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary offerings and technologies in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources furthermore a reduction in the number and availability of compatible thirdparty applications or our inability to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes including those related to cloud computing mobile devices and new computing platforms may adversely affect the sale of our solutions because of these and other factors competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which would likely harm our business 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls  

  

our offerings are subject to us export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations that prohibit the delivery of certain solutions and services without the required export authorizations or export to locations governments and persons targeted by us sanctions while we have processes in place to prevent our offerings from being exported in violation of these laws including obtaining authorizations as appropriate and screening against us government and international lists of restricted and prohibited persons we cannot guarantee that these processes will prevent all violations of export control and sanctions laws 

  

we also note that if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm as well as other negative consequences including government investigations and penalties we presently incorporate export control and sanctions compliance requirements in our channel partner agreements complying with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities violations of us sanctions or export control laws can result in fines or penalties 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the us we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change our exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 

we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our cash flow exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as part of our risk management strategy we use foreign currency contracts to manage a portion of our exposures of underlying assets liabilities and other obligations which exist as part of our ongoing business operations these foreign currency instruments have maturities that extend for one to twelve months in the future and provide us with some protection against currency exposures however our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be completely successful resulting in an adverse impact on our financial results 

the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period although our foreign currency cash flow hedge program extends beyond the current quarter in order to reduce our exposure to foreign currency volatility we do not attempt to completely mitigate this risk and in any case will incur transaction fees in adopting such hedging programs such volatility even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings 

in addition brexit may contribute to volatility in foreign exchange markets with respect to the british pound and euro which we may not be able to effectively manage and our financial results could be adversely impacted additionally countries in which we operate may be classified as highly inflationary economies requiring special accounting and financial reporting treatment for such operations or such countries’ currencies may be devalued or both which may adversely impact our business operations and financial results

if we do not maintain good relationships with the members of our distribution channel our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected if our distribution channel suffers financial losses becomes financially unstable or insolvent or is not provided the right mix of incentives to sell our subscriptions our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected 

we sell our software products both directly to endusers and through a network of distributors and resellers for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019  approximately 70 and 71  respectively of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the near future our ability to effectively distribute our solutions depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller network computer software distributors and resellers typically are not highly capitalized have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and experienced difficulties during the past several years we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of distributors and resellers prior to our sales to them in the past we have taken steps to support them and may take additional steps in the future such as extending credit terms and providing temporary discounts these steps if taken could harm our financial results if our distributors and resellers were to become insolvent they would not be able to maintain their business and sales or provide customer support services which would negatively impact our business and revenue 

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including the distributors tech data and ingram micro tech data accounted for 35 of our total net revenue for both fiscal 2020 and 2019 and ingram micro accounted for 10 and 11 of our total net revenue for fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively should any of our agreements with tech data and ingram micro be terminated for any reason we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data and ingram micro would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue consequently we believe our business is not substantially dependent on either tech data or ingram micro however if either distributor were to experience a significant disruption with its business or if our relationship with either of them were to significantly deteriorate it is possible that our ability to sell to end users would be at least temporarily negatively impacted this could in turn negatively impact our financial results for example on november 13 2019 tech data announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an affiliate of funds managed by affiliates of apollo global management a global alternative investment manager the transaction is not subject to a financing condition and is expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2020 subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions the transaction has been approved by tech data stockholders but has not yet closed if there is any uncertainty resulting from the transaction between tech data and apollo with the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data our ability to sell to these resellers and end users could be at least temporarily negatively impacted 

over time we have modified and will continue to modify aspects of our relationship with our distributors and resellers such as their incentive programs pricing to them and our distribution model to motivate and reward them for aligning their businesses with our strategy and business objectives changes in these relationships and underlying programs could negatively impact their business and harm our business further our distributors and resellers may lose confidence in our business move to competitive products or may not have the skills or ability to support customers the loss of or a significant reduction in business with those distributors or resellers could harm our business in particular if one or more of such distributors or resellers were unable to meet their obligations with respect to accounts payable to us we could be forced to write off such accounts and may be required to delay the recognition of revenue on future sales to these customers these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

our financial results key metrics and other operating metrics fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenue and financial results difficult to predict 

our quarterly financial results key metrics and other operating metrics have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so in the future these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines we also provide investors with quarterly and annual financial forwardlooking guidance that could prove to be inaccurate as a result of these fluctuations in addition to the other factors described in this part i item 1a some of the factors that could cause our financial results key metrics and other operating metrics to fluctuate include

we have also experienced fluctuations in financial results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic or political conditions in particular our financial results in europe during our third quarter are usually affected by a slower summer period and our apac operations typically experience seasonal slowing in our third and fourth quarters 

our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenue and are relatively fixed in the short term accordingly any revenue shortfall below expectations has had and in the future could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability greater than anticipated expenses or a failure to maintain rigorous cost controls would also negatively affect profitability 

because we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from a small number of solutions including our autocadbased software products and collections if these offerings are not successful our revenue will be adversely affected 

we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from sales of subscriptions of a limited number of our offerings including autocad software solutions based on autocad which include our collections that serve specific markets and products that are interoperable with autocad any factor adversely affecting sales of these subscriptions including the product release cycle market acceptance product competition performance and reliability reputation price competition economic and market conditions and the availability of thirdparty applications would likely harm our financial results during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019  combined revenue from our autocad and autocad lt family products not including collections having autocad or autocad lt as a component represented 29 and 28 of our total net revenue respectively 

our debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations 

we have 21 billion of debt consisting of notes due at various times from december 2022 to january 2030 as described in part 2 item 8 we also entered into a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of 6500 million with an option to be increased up to 10 billion as described in part 2 item 8 maintenance of our indebtedness contractual restrictions and additional issuances of indebtedness could 

 

 

 

 

 

we are required to comply with the covenants set forth in our credit agreement such as an interest coverage ratio in effect january 31 2019 and a leverage ratio in effect july 31 2019 if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or lenders then subject to applicable cure periods we would not be able to incur additional indebtedness under the credit agreement described in part 2 item 8 and any outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement may be

declared immediately due and payable in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities under certain circumstances if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under our credit agreement could increase downgrades in our credit ratings could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing 

if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights our business could be harmed 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright and trademark laws trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our software is timeconsuming and costly we are unable to measure the extent to which unauthorized use of our software exists and we expect that unauthorized use of software will remain a persistent problem particularly in emerging economies furthermore our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 

additionally we actively protect the secrecy of our confidential information and trade secrets including our source code if unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code the loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our offerings by copying functionality which could adversely affect our financial performance and our reputation we also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of nondisclosure agreements with our employees customers contractors vendors and partners however it is possible that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization if this were to occur it may be difficult andor costly for us to enforce our rights and our financial performance and reputation could be negatively impacted 

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in the loss of significant rights 

as more software patents are granted worldwide the number of offerings and competitors in our industries grows and the functionality of products in different industries overlaps we expect that software developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims infringement or misappropriation claims have in the past been and may in the future be asserted against us and any such assertions could harm our business additionally certain patent holders without products have become more aggressive in threatening and pursuing litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents any such claims or threats whether with or without merit have been and could in the future be timeconsuming to defend result in costly litigation and diversion of resources cause product delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in addition such royalty or license agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms if at all which would likely harm our business 

we rely on software from third parties and a failure to properly manage our use of thirdparty software could result in increased costs or loss of revenue 

many of our products are designed to include software licensed from third parties such thirdparty software includes software licensed from commercial suppliers and software licensed under public open source licenses we have internal processes to manage our use of such thirdparty software however if we fail to adequately manage our use of thirdparty software then we may be subject to copyright infringement or other thirdparty claims if we are noncompliant with a license for commercial software then we may be required to pay penalties or undergo costly audits pursuant to the license agreement in the case of opensource software licensed under certain “copyleft” licenses the license itself may require or a courtimposed remedy for noncompliant use of the open source software may require that proprietary portions of our own software be publicly disclosed or licensed this could result in a loss of intellectual property rights increased costs damage to our reputation andor a loss of revenue

from time to time we realign or introduce new business and sales initiatives if we fail to successfully execute and manage these initiatives our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

as part of our effort to accommodate our customers needs and demands and the rapid evolution of technology we from time to time evolve our business and sales initiatives such as realigning our development and marketing organizations offering software as a service and realigning our internal resources in an effort to improve efficiency we may take such actions without clear indications that they will prove successful and at times we have been met with shortterm challenges in the execution of such initiatives market acceptance of any new business or sales initiative is dependent on our ability to match our customers needs at the right time and price often we have limited prior experience and operating history in these new areas of emphasis if any of our assumptions about expenses revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated and our financial results will be negatively impacted 

net revenue arr billings earnings cash flow or subscriptions shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline 

the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including the other factors described in this part i  item 1a and the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant changes in the price of our common stock could expose us to costly and timeconsuming litigation historically after periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities a company becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts managements attention and resources 

our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our success and ability to invest and grow depend largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical professional managerial sales and marketing personnel historically competition for these key personnel has been intense the loss of services of any of our key personnel including key personnel joining our company through acquisitions the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions and financial goals

our investment portfolio consists of a variety of investment vehicles that are subject to interest rate trends market volatility and other economic factors if general economic conditions decline this could cause the credit ratings of our investments to deteriorate illiquidity in the financial marketplace and we may experience a decline in interest income and an inability to sell our investments leading to impairment in the value of our investments 

it is our policy to invest our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in highly liquid instruments with and in the custody of financial institutions with high credit ratings and to limit the amounts invested with any one institution type of security and issuer however we are subject to general economic conditions interest rate trends and volatility in the financial marketplace that can affect the income that we receive from our investments the net realizable value of our investments including our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and our ability to sell them any one of these factors could reduce our investment income or result in material charges which in turn could impact our overall net income loss and earnings loss per share 

from time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies privately held company investments are considered inherently risky the technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies 

a loss on any of our investments may cause us to record an otherthantemporary impairment charge the effect of this charge could impact our overall net income loss and earnings loss per share in any of these scenarios our liquidity may be negatively impacted which in turn may prohibit us from making investments in our business taking advantage of opportunities and potentially meeting our financial obligations as they come due 

we are subject to legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries and we may be named in additional legal proceedings or become involved in regulatory inquiries in the future all of which are costly distracting to our core business and could result in an unfavorable outcome or a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or the trading prices for our securities 

we are involved in legal proceedings and receive inquiries from regulatory agencies as the global economy has changed and our business has evolved we have seen an increase in litigation activity and regulatory inquiries like many other high technology companies the number and frequency of inquiries from us and foreign regulatory agencies we have received regarding our business and our business practices and the business practices of others in our industry have increased in recent years in the event that we are involved in significant disputes or are the subject of a formal action by a regulatory agency we could be exposed to costly and timeconsuming legal proceedings that could result in any number of outcomes any claims or regulatory actions initiated by or against us whether successful or not could result in expensive costs of defense costly damage awards injunctive relief increased costs of business fines or orders to change certain business practices significant dedication of management time diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business in any of these cases our financial results results of operations cash flows or the trading prices for our securities could be negatively impacted 

changes in tax rules and regulations and uncertainties in interpretation and application could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions our effective tax rate is primarily based on our expected geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany arrangements including the manner we develop value and license our intellectual property and enacted tax rules significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis while we believe our tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 

tax laws in the united states and in foreign tax jurisdictions are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied for example the us government enacted significant tax law changes in december 2017 the us tax cuts and jobs act tax act which impacted our tax obligations and effective tax rate beginning in our fiscal 2018 tax year due to the complexity and varying interpretations of the tax act the us department of 

2020 form 10k 27 

table of contents 

treasury and other standardsetting bodies have been issuing and will continue to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that could significantly impact how we will apply the law and the ultimate impact to our results of operations from the tax act including for our prior tax years 

increasingly governmental tax authorities are scrutinizing existing corporate tax regulatory and legal regimes many countries in the european union as well as other countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development are actively considering new taxing regimes and changes to existing tax laws that are contrary to the way in which we have interpreted and historically applied the rules and regulations in our tax returns filed in such jurisdictions if us or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge how or where our profits are currently recognized our overall taxes could increase and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted 

changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the way we conduct our business further such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective 

we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting the report contains among other matters an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 

if our management or independent registered public accounting firm identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we would be unable to assert that such internal control over financial reporting is effective if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion that our internal controls are effective we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 

in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements which if not accurate may significantly impact our financial results 

we make assumptions judgments and estimates for a number of items including revenue recognition for our hybrid desktop software and cloud service subscriptions the fair value of financial instruments goodwill longlived assets and other intangible assets the realizability of deferred tax assets and the fair value of stock awards we also make assumptions judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee related liabilities including commissions bonuses and sabbaticals and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions partner incentive programs product returns reserves allowances for doubtful accounts asset retirement obligations and legal contingencies these assumptions judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from our estimates and such differences could significantly impact our financial results 

we rely on thirdparty technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies our solutions and service development may be delayed and our financial results negatively impacted 

we rely on certain software that we license from third parties including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our offerings to perform key functions these thirdparty software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and the software may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such software could result in 

2020 form 10k 28 

table of contents 

increased costs or delays until equivalent software can be developed identified licensed and integrated which would likely harm our business 

disruptions with licensing relationships and thirdparty developers could adversely impact our business 

we license certain key technologies from third parties licenses may be restricted in the term or the use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business similarly we may not be able to obtain or renew license agreements for key technology on favorable terms if at all and any failure to do so could harm our business 

our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with thirdparty developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn in particular markets such disruptions have in the past and would likely in the future negatively impact these thirdparty developers and end users which could harm our business 

additionally technology created by outsourced product development whether outsourced to third parties or developed externally and transferred to us through business or technology acquisitions has certain additional risks such as effective integration into existing products adequate transfer of technology knowhow and ownership and protection of transferred intellectual property 

as a result of our strategy of partnering with other companies for product development our product delivery schedules could be adversely affected if we experience difficulties with our product development partners 

we partner with certain independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities we believe our partnering strategy allows us to among other things achieve efficiencies in developing new products and maintaining and enhancing existing product offerings our partnering strategy creates a dependency on such independent developers independent developers including those who currently develop solutions for us in the us and throughout the world may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future in addition use of development resources through consulting relationships particularly in nonus jurisdictions with developing legal systems may be adversely impacted by and expose us to risks relating to evolving employment export and intellectual property laws these risks could among other things expose our intellectual property to misappropriation and result in disruptions to product delivery schedules 

our business may be significantly disrupted upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event 

our business is highly automated and relies extensively on the availability of our network and data center infrastructure our internal technology systems and our websites we also rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide to our customers and computer operations for our internal use the failure of our systems or hosted computer services due to a catastrophic event such as an earthquake fire flood tsunami weather event telecommunications failure power failure cyber attack terrorism or war could adversely impact our business financial results and financial condition we have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems in order to reduce the potential impact of a catastrophic event however there can be no assurance that these plans and systems would enable us to return to normal business operations in addition any such event could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products this could in turn decrease that countrys or regions demand for our products thereby negatively impacting our financial results 

if we were required to record an impairment charge related to the value of our longlived assets or an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets our results of operations would be adversely affected 

our longlived assets are tested for impairment if indicators of impairment exist if impairment testing shows that the carrying value of our longlived assets exceeds their estimated fair values we would be required to record a noncash impairment charge which would decrease the carrying value of our longlived assets as the case may be and our results of operations would be adversely affected our deferred tax assets include net operating loss amortizable tax assets and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods each quarter we assess the need for a valuation allowance considering both positive and negative evidence to determine whether all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in fiscal 2016 and in fiscal 2018 we determined that it was more likely than not that autodesk would not realize our us and singapore deferred tax assets respectively and established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets we continued to have a full valuation allowance against our us canada and netherlands and released our valuation allowance against our singapore deferred tax assets in fiscal 2020  release of the singapore valuation allowance resulted in a material benefit in the fourth quarter changes in the amount of the us and

strategy 

autodesk makes software for people who make things if you have ever driven a highperformance car admired a towering skyscraper used a smartphone or watched a great film chances are you have experienced what millions of autodesk customers are doing with our software we empower innovators to achieve the new possible  enabling them to discover firstinkind solutions to complex design challenges deliver tangible outcomes in record time and make datapowered decisions for sustainable outcomes 

our strategy is to build enduring relationships with customers delivering innovative technology that provides valuable automation and insight into their design and make process to drive execution of our strategy we are focused on three strategic priorities delivering on the promise of subscription digitizing the company and reimagining construction manufacturing and production 

we equip and inspire our users with the tailored tools services and access they need for success today and tomorrow at every step we help users harness the power of data to build upon their ideas and explore new ways of imagining collaborating and creating to achieve better outcomes for their customers for society and for the world and because creativity can’t flourish in silos we connect what matters  from steps in a project to collaborators on a unified platform 

autodesk was founded during the platform transition from mainframe computers and engineering workstations to personal computers we developed and sustained a compelling value proposition based upon desktop software for the personal computer just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry over 30 years ago the software industry has undergone a transition from developing and selling perpetual licenses and onpremises products to subscriptions and cloudenabled technologies 

product evolution 

to address this shift autodesk made a strategic decision to shift its business model from selling perpetual licenses and maintenance plans to selling subscriptions 

today we offer subscriptions for individual products and industry collections ebas and cloud service offerings collectively referred to as subscription plan subscription plans are designed to give our customers more flexibility with how they use our offerings and to attract a broader range of customers such as projectbased users and small businesses 

2020 form 10k 34 

table of contents 

our subscription plans currently represent a hybrid of desktop software and cloud functionality which provides a deviceindependent collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders our cloud offerings for example bim 360 shotgun autocad web app and autocad mobile app provide tools including mobile and collaboration capabilities to streamline design collaboration building and manufacturing and data management processes we believe that customer adoption of these new offerings will continue to grow as customers across a range of industries begin to take advantage of the scalable computing power and flexibility provided through these new services 

industry collections provide our customers with increased access to a broader selection of autodesk solutions and services that exceeds those previously available in suites  simplifying the customers ability to get access to a complete set of tools for their industry 

we discontinued the sale of new commercial licenses of most individual software products in fiscal 2016 additionally in fiscal 2018 we commenced a program to incentivize maintenance plan customers to move to subscription plan offerings maintenancetosubscription m2s  while at the same time increasing maintenance plan pricing over time for customers that remain on maintenance plans since launching the program a substantial majority of maintenance plan customers have converted to subscription plan offerings  we will be retiring maintenance offerings as of augest 7 2021 customers will have a oneyear period starting august 7 2020 to convert a maintenance seat to subscription plan offerings 

to support our strategic priority of reimagining construction in fiscal 2019 we strengthened the foundation of our construction solutions with both organic and inorganic investments in addition to investing in our bim 360 portfolio we acquired assemble systems for quantity take off functionality plangrid for documentcentric workflows and field execution and buildingconnected for bidding and estimation processes the broadened product portfolio the autodesk construction cloud has helped us expand our presence with subcontractors trades people and building owners 

as part of our manufacturing strategy we continue to attract both global manufacturing leaders and disruptive startups with our generative design and our fusion 360 technology enhancements 

our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products technology and businesses for example in fiscal 2019 we acquired assemble systems a leading provider of key workflow software solutions plangrid a leading provider of construction productivity software and buildingconnected a leading preconstruction platform we believe that these acquisitions have enabled us to offer a more comprehensive cloudbased construction platform acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers however they entail cost and integration challenges and may in certain instances negatively impact our operating margins we continually review these factors in making decisions regarding acquisitions we currently anticipate that we will continue to acquire products technology and businesses as compelling opportunities become available 

we evaluate annualized recurring revenue arr growth of billings and remaining performance obligations in determining business momentum to analyze progress we have disaggregated our growth between the original maintenance model and the subscription plan model maintenance plan subscriptions peaked in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 as we discontinued selling new maintenance plan subscriptions in fiscal 2017 and we expect the number of these subscriptions to keep declining over time as maintenance plan customers continue to convert to our subscription plans we will be retiring maintenance offerings as of august 7 2021 customers will have a oneyear period starting august 7 2020 to convert a maintenance seat to subscription plan offerings 

global reach 

we sell our products and services globally through a combination of indirect and direct channels our indirect channels include value added resellers direct market resellers distributors computer manufacturers and other software developers our direct channels include internal sales resources dedicated to selling in our largest accounts our highly specialized solutions and business transacted through our online autodesk branded store see note 2   revenue recognition  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the results of our indirect and direct channel sales for the fiscal years ended january 31 2020  2019  and 2018  

we anticipate that our channel mix will continue to change as we scale our online autodesk branded store business and our largest accounts shift towards directonly business models however we expect our indirect channel will continue to transact and support the majority of our customers and revenue we employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to 

2020 form 10k 35 

table of contents 

align our direct and indirect channels with our business strategies in addition we have a worldwide user group organization and we have created online user communities dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products 

one of our key strategies is to maintain an openarchitecture design of our software products to facilitate thirdparty development of complementary products and industryspecific software solutions this approach enables customers and third parties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses we offer several programs that provide strategic investment funding technological platforms user communities technical support forums and events to developers who develop addon applications for our products for example we have established the autodesk forge developer program to support innovators that build solutions to facilitate the development of a single connected ecosystem for the future of how things are designed made and used as well as support ideas that push the boundaries of 3d printing 

in addition to the competitive advantages afforded by our technology our large global network of distributors resellers thirdparty developers customers educational institutions educators and students is a key competitive advantage which has been cultivated over an extensive period this network of partners and relationships provides us with a broad and deep reach into volume markets around the world our distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with the resources to purchase deploy learn and support our solutions quickly and easily we have a significant number of registered thirdparty developers who create products that work well with our solutions and extend them for a variety of specialized applications 

better world 

to help our customers imagine design and make a better world our sustainability initiatives focus our efforts on the areas where we can have the greatest positive impact products and support catalyzing impact and innovation in our future markets and leading by example with our 100 renewable and sustainable business practices through our products and services we are supporting our customers to better understand and improve the environmental performance of everything they make and mitigate the causes and effects of climate change 

the autodesk foundation the foundation a privately funded 501c3 charity organization established and solely funded by us leads our philanthropic efforts the purpose of the foundation is twofold to support employees to make a better world by matching employees volunteer time andor donations to nonprofit organizations and to support organizations and individuals using design to drive positive social and environmental impact on our behalf the foundation also administers a discounted software donation program to nonprofit organizations social and environmental entrepreneurs and others who are developing design solutions that will shape a more sustainable future 

assumptions behind our strategy 

our strategy depends upon a number of assumptions including making our technology available to mainstream markets leveraging our large global network of distributors resellers thirdparty developers customers educational institutions and students improving the performance and functionality of our products and adequately protecting our intellectual property if the outcome of any of these assumptions differs from our expectations we may not be able to implement our strategy which could potentially adversely affect our business for further discussion regarding these and related risks see part i  item 1a  “ risk factors ” 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

our significant accounting policies are described in part ii  item 8  note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements we believe that of all our significant accounting policies the following accounting policies and specific estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these 

2020 form 10k 36 

table of contents 

are the accounting policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition    judgments with multiple performance obligations our contracts with customers may include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer a performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer products or services that are distinct determining whether products and services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as a single performance obligation may require significant judgment that requires us to assess the nature of the promise and value delivered to the customer and the interaction of the desktop applications and cloud functionalities 

for our product subscriptions cloud service offerings and flexible enterprise business arrangements the functional nature of the promise as well as the customers value expectations led us to conclude desktop applications and cloud functionalities are not distinct in the context of the contract and should be accounted for as a single performance obligation there is a high degree of interaction of the desktop applications and cloud functionalities which is not available with the desktop applications alone or in conjunction with thirdparty cloud service providers furthermore customers are not able to use the desktop applications for its intended purpose without our cloud functionalities 

for contracts with more than one performance obligation the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations in an amount that depicts the relative standalone selling price ssp of each obligation judgment is required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount that should be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services 

in instances where ssp is not directly observable such as when we do not sell the product or service separately we determine the ssp using information that includes market conditions and other observable inputs we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer and circumstance in these instances we use relevant information such as the sales channel and geographic region to determine the ssp 

privately held company investments privately held debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity the carrying value is adjusted for our privately held equity securities if there are observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment as discussed below the determination of whether an orderly transaction is for a same or similar investment requires significant management judgment including the nature of rights and obligations of the investments the extent to which differences in those rights and obligations would affect the fair values of those investments and the impact of any differences based on the stage of operational development of the investee 

these assumptions are inherently subjective and involve significant management judgment whenever possible we use observable market data and rely on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available when determining fair value 

we assess our privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio quarterly for impairment our impairment analysis encompasses an assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment and qualitative and quantitative analysis of other key factors including the investee’s financial metrics the investee’s products and technologies meeting or exceeding predefined milestones market acceptance of the product or technology other competitive products or technology in the market general market conditions management and governance structure of the investee the investee’s liquidity debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash if the investment is impaired we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statement of operations and establishing a new carrying value for the investment 

business combinations the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations 

although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain and unpredictable unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such 

2020 form 10k 37 

table of contents 

assumptions estimates or actual results examples of critical estimates used in valuing certain of the intangible assets and in determining the assets useful lives for the assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to 

 

 

 

 

 

realizability of longlived assets we assess the realizability of our longlived assets and related intangible assets other than goodwill quarterly or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review significant underperformance of a business or product line relative to budget shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends and the results of past impairment reviews when such events or changes in circumstances occur we assess recoverability of these assets 

we assess recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows we would perform a discounted cash flow analysis to assess impairments on longlived assets 

the key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model include the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows we also make judgments about the remaining useful lives of acquired intangible assets and other longlived assets that have finite lives 

variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge impairment charges if any result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values 

income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability approach under this method deferred tax assets including those related to tax loss carryforwards and credits and deferred tax liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we recognize the tax benefit for an uncertain tax position when it meets the more likely than not threshold for recognition we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense 

a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be recovered the valuation allowance is determined by assessing both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable such assessment is required on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis significant judgment is required in determining whether the valuation allowance should be recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income as a result of cumulative losses arising from our transition to a subscription model we considered cumulative losses as a significant source of negative evidence and recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax attributes in canada netherlands and the us jurisdictions we released the valuation allowance against our deferred tax attributes in singapore in fiscal year 2020 as a result of positive earnings in that jurisdiction 

as we continually strive to optimize our overall business model tax planning strategies may become feasible and prudent whereby management may determine that it is more likely than not that the federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized 

2020 form 10k 38 

table of contents 

each quarter we will continue to evaluate the positive and negative evidence of our ability to utilize our us and foreign deferred tax assets 

loss contingencies  as described in part i  item 3  “ legal proceedings ” and part ii  item 8  note 10  “ commitments and contingencies ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters due to inherent uncertainties related to these matters we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time until the final resolution of such matters there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations

revenue analysis 

during fiscal 2020  net revenue in creased 27  as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to a 53 in crease in subscription revenue the in crease in subscription revenue was partially offset by a 39 de crease in maintenance revenue 

further discussion of the drivers of these results are discussed below under the heading “results of operations” 

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including tech data corporation and its global affiliates collectively “tech data” total sales to tech data accounted for 35  35  and 31 of autodesks total net revenue during fiscal 2020  2019  and 2018  respectively during fiscal 2020  2019  and 2018  ingram micro accounted for 10  11  and 8 of autodesks total net revenue should any of our agreements with tech data and ingram micro be terminated for any reason we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data and ingram micro would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue consequently we believe our business is not substantially dependent on tech data and ingram micro 

recurring revenue arr and net revenue retention rate 

in order to help better understand our financial performance we use several key performance metrics including recurring revenue arr and nr3 these metrics are key performance metrics and should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as these metrics are not intended to be combined with those items we use these metrics to monitor the strength of our recurring business we believe these metrics are useful to investors because they can help in monitoring the longterm health of our business our determination and presentation of these metrics may differ from that of other companies the presentation of these metrics is meant to be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or in isolation from our financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap please refer to the glossary of terms for the definitions of these metrics in part i  item 1 business

nr3 was within the approximate range of 110 and 120 as of january 31 2020 and 2019  

foreign currency analysis 

we generate a significant amount of our revenue in the united states japan germany the united kingdom and finland 

the following table shows the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on our net revenue and total spend 

  

 

changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue total spend and income loss from operations in future periods we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on a portion of the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions but do not attempt to completely mitigate the impact of fluctuations of such foreign currency against the us dollar 

remaining performance obligations 

rpo represents deferred revenue and contractually stated or committed orders under early renewal and multiyear billing plans for subscription services license and maintenance for which the associated deferred revenue has not yet been recognized 

2020 form 10k 40 

table of contents 

unbilled deferred revenue is not included as a receivable or deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets see part ii  item 8  note 2  “ revenue recognition ” for more details on autodesks performance obligations 



  

we expect that the amount of rpo will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons including the specific timing duration and size of customer subscription and support agreements varying billing cycles of such agreements the specific timing of customer renewals and foreign currency fluctuations 

balance sheet and cash flow items 

at january 31 2020  we had  18437 million in cash and marketable securities our cash flow from operations increased to 14151 million for the fiscal year ended january 31 2020  from 3771 million for the fiscal year ended january 31 2019  we repurchased 27 million shares of our common stock for  4555 million during fiscal 2020  comparatively we repurchased 22 million shares of our common stock for  2925 million during fiscal 2019  further discussion regarding the balance sheet and cash flow activities are discussed below under the heading “liquidity and capital resources” 

results of operations 

impacts of covid19 to autodesk’s business 

the impacts of the global emergence of covid19 on our business and financial results are currently unknown we are conducting business with substantial modifications to employee travel employee work locations and virtualization or cancellation of certain sales and marketing events among other modifications we have observed other companies as well as many governments taking precautionary and preemptive actions to address covid19 and they may take further actions that alter their normal business operations we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners suppliers and stockholders it is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business including the effects on our customers and prospects or on our financial results

interest and other expense net 

the following table sets forth the components of interest and other expense net 



interest and other expense net increased by  305 million during fiscal 2020  as compared to fiscal 2019  this was primarily driven by losses in the current year versus gains in the previous year for unrealized gain loss on our privatelyheld strategic investments curtailment gains on our pension plans in the prior period and an increase in interest expense resulting from our term loan entered into on december 17 2018 in aggregate principal amount of 5000 million  which has been paid in full as of january 31 2020 the increase in interest and other expense net was partially offset by marktomarket gains in the current year versus losses in the prior year on marketable securities 

interest and other expense net positively changed  305 million during fiscal 2019  as compared to fiscal 2018  primarily driven by curtailment gains on our pension plans marktomarket gains on certain of our privatelyheld strategic investments realized gains on sales of strategic investments offset by an increase in interest expense resulting from our term loan entered into on december 17 2018 in aggregate principal amount of 500 million and marktomarket losses on marketable securities 

interest expense and investment income fluctuates based on average cash marketable securities and debt balances average maturities and interest rates 

gains and losses on foreign currency are primarily due to the impact of remeasuring foreign currency transactions and net monetary assets into the functional currency of the corresponding entity the amount of the gain or loss on foreign currency is driven by the volume of foreign currency transactions and the foreign currency exchange rates for the year 

provision for income taxes 

we account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse 

income tax expense was 803 million and 381 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019  respectively relative to pretax income of 2948 million and pretax losses of 427 million  respectively for the same periods tax expense for fiscal 2020 consists primarily of foreign tax expense including withholding tax and us tax amortization on indefinitelived intangibles offset by a benefit for the release of the singapore valuation allowance tax expense for fiscal 2019 consisted of foreign tax expense including withholding tax and us tax amortization on indefinitelived intangibles offset by a tax benefit from the release of valuation allowance from acquired deferred tax liabilities and a tax benefit for the release of uncertain tax positions upon finalization of irs examination we recorded a tax benefit of the tax act in our financial statements as of january 31 2018 of approximately 323 million mainly driven by the corporate rate remeasurement of the indefinitelived intangible deferred tax liability 

the tax act provided broad and significant changes to the us corporate income tax regime in light of our fiscal yearend the tax act reduced the statutory federal corporate rate from 35  to 34 for fiscal 2018 and to 21 for fiscal 2019 and forward the tax act also among many other provisions imposed a onetime mandatory tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries commonly referred to as the transition tax to which we were subject in our fiscal year 2018 subjects the deemed intangible income of our foreign subsidiaries to current us taxation commonly referred to as gilti provides for a full dividends received deduction upon repatriation of untaxed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries imposes a minimum taxation without most tax credits on modified taxable income which is generally taxable income without deductions for payments to related foreign companies commonly referred to as “beat” modifies the accelerated depreciation deduction

rules and made updates to the deductibility of certain expenses we have completed our determination of the accounting implications of the tax act on our tax accruals the us global taxation resulting from the significant changes of the tax act could have a material effect on our future judgment of the realization of the net us deferred tax assets 

as of january 31 2018 we estimated taxable income associated with offshore earnings of 8315 million  and as of january 31 2019 we adjusted the taxable income to 8196 million for transition tax we had an incremental adjustment to our transition tax in our fiscal year 2020 of 455 million  as a result of additional treasury regulations published this year transition tax related to adjustments in the offshore earnings or correlated foreign tax credits resulted in no impact to the effective tax rate as it is primarily offset by net operating losses that are subject to a full valuation allowance as a result of transition tax we recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately 432 million for foreign tax credits which are also subject to a full valuation allowance 

we have not had a gilti inclusion in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 resulting in no impact to the effective tax rate we anticipate we will be subject to gilti in fiscal 2021 resulting in utilization of carryforward net operating losses given the increase in our global earnings in the current year and expectation of continued increase in global earnings the company anticipates a significant increase in us taxable income beginning fiscal 2021 moreover if we are subject to gilti in fiscal 2021 the inclusion of foreign earnings will be positive evidence in our evaluation of our need for a valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets 

we anticipate that the us department of treasury and other standardsetting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered as future guidance is issued we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our financial statements in the period in which the adjustments are made 

a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be recovered the valuation allowance is determined by assessing both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable such assessment is required on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis significant judgment is required in determining whether the valuation allowance should be recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income in our fiscal year 2016 we considered cumulative losses in the us from our business model transition as a significant source of negative evidence considering this negative evidence and the absence of sufficient positive objective evidence that we would generate sufficient taxable income in the us to realize the deferred tax assets we determined that it was more likely than not that we would not realize the us federal and state deferred tax assets and recorded a full valuation allowance foreign operation in the netherlands and canada that generated nondeductible interest expense and future creditable research and development in excess of earnings respectively also resulted in the historic recording of a full valuation under the morelikelythannot realizability criteria furthermore in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 our singapore operation similar to the us incurred cumulative losses and recorded a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset as a result of positive earnings in singapore our valuation allowance was released in our fiscal year 2020 resulting in a 420 million noncash benefit to earnings future sources of taxable income from book earning trends and reversal of deferred temporary taxable differences including the interplays of the tax act on us global taxable income will continue to be monitored by the company for future release of our valuation allowances as we continually strive to optimize our overall business model tax planning strategies may become feasible whereby management may determine based on all available evidence both positive and negative that it is more likely than not that the federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized 

as of january 31 2020  we had  2206 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which  2037 million would reduce our valuation allowance if recognized the remaining 169 million would impact the effective tax rate it is possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months however an estimate of the range of the possible change cannot be made at this time 

our future effective annual tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate changes in valuation allowances level of profit before tax accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits and changes in tax laws including impacts of the tax act a significant amount of our earnings is generated by our europe and asia pacific subsidiaries our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates

other financial information 

in addition to our results determined under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” discussed above we believe the following nongaap measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the fiscal years ended january 31 2020  2019  and 2018  our gross profit gross margin income loss from operations operating margin net income loss diluted net income loss per share and diluted shares used in per share calculation on a gaap and nongaap basis were as follows in millions except for gross margin operating margin and per share data 



  

for our internal budgeting and resource allocation process and as a means to provide consistency in periodtoperiod comparisons we use nongaap measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis these nongaap measures do not include certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results we also use nongaap measures in making operating decisions because we believe those measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our earning potential and performance for management by excluding certain benefits credits expenses and charges that may not be indicative of our core business operating results for the reasons set forth below we believe these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors both because 1 they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and 2 they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business this allows investors and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management compare financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the longterm performance of our core business we also use some of these measures for purposes of determining companywide incentive compensation 

there are limitations in using nongaap financial measures because nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies the nongaap financial measures included above are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results in addition they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the nongaap financial measures we compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a gaap basis as well as a nongaap basis and also by providing gaap measures in our public disclosures the presentation of nongaap financial information is meant to be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or in isolation from the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap we urge investors to

our nongaap financial measures may exclude the following 

stockbased compensation expenses we exclude stockbased compensation expenses from nongaap measures primarily because they are noncash expenses and management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods moreover because of varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under fasb asc topic 718 we believe excluding stockbased compensation expenses allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies 

amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangibles we incur amortization of acquisitionrelated developed technology and purchased intangibles in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangibles is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions management finds it useful to exclude these variable charges from our cost of revenues to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangible assets will recur in future periods 

ceo transition costs we exclude amounts paid to the companys former ceos upon departure under the terms of their transition agreements including severance payments acceleration of restricted stock units and continued vesting of performance stock units and legal fees incurred with the transition also excluded from our nongaap measures are recruiting costs related to the search for a new ceo these costs represent nonrecurring expenses and are not indicative of our ongoing operating expenses we further believe that excluding the ceo transition costs from our nongaap results is useful to investors in that it allows for periodoverperiod comparability 

goodwill impairment this is a noncash charge to writedown goodwill to fair value when there was an indication that the asset was impaired as explained above management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

restructuring and other exit costs net these expenses are associated with realigning our business strategies based on current economic conditions in connection with these restructuring actions or other exit actions we recognize costs related to termination benefits for former employees whose positions were eliminated the closure of facilities and cancellation of certain contracts we exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing business and operating results we believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses 

2020 form 10k 53 

table of contents 

acquisition related costs we exclude certain acquisition related costs including due diligence costs professional fees in connection with an acquisition certain financing costs and certain integration related expenses these expenses are unpredictable and dependent on factors that may be outside of our control and unrelated to the continuing operations of the acquired business or our company in addition the size and complexity of an acquisition which often drives the magnitude of acquisition related costs may not be indicative of such future costs we believe excluding acquisition related costs facilitates the comparison of our financial results to the companys historical operating results and to other companies in our industry 

gain loss on strategic investments and dispositions we exclude gains and losses related to our strategic investments and dispositions from our nongaap measures primarily because management finds it useful to exclude these variable gains and losses on these investments and dispositions in assessing our financial results included in these amounts are noncash unrealized gains and losses on the derivative components dividends received realized gains and losses on the sales or losses on the impairment of these investments and dispositions we believe excluding these items is useful to investors because these excluded items do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business and these losses or gains were incurred in connection with strategic investments and dispositions which do not occur regularly 

discrete tax items we exclude the gaap tax provision including discrete items from the nongaap measure of net loss income and include a nongaap tax provision based upon the projected annual nongaap effective tax rate discrete tax items include income tax expenses or benefits that do not relate to ordinary income from continuing operations in the current fiscal year unusual or infrequently occurring items or the tax impact of certain stockbased compensation examples of discrete tax items include but are not limited to certain changes in judgment and changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years certain costs related to business combinations certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets or changes in tax law management believes this approach assists investors in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations we believe the exclusion of these discrete tax items provides investors with useful supplemental information about our operational performance 

establishment release of a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets these are a noncash charge to record or to release a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets as explained above management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various cash expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

income tax effects on the difference between gaap and nongaap costs and expenses the income tax effects that are excluded from the nongaap measures relate to the tax impact on the difference between gaap and nongaap expenses primarily due to stockbased compensation amortization of purchased intangibles and restructuring charges and other exit costs benefits for gaap and nongaap measures 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of cash is from the sale of our software and related services our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employeerelated expenses such as compensation and benefits as well as general operating expenses for marketing facilities and overhead costs in addition to operating expenses we also use cash to fund our stock repurchase program repay existing debt and invest in our growth initiatives which include acquisitions of products technology and businesses see further discussion of these items below 

at january 31 2020  our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  18437 million and net accounts receivable of 6523 million  on march 4 2020 we redeemed in full 4500 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 3125 senior notes due june 15 2020 see note 17 subsequent events for further discussion on the repayment

our cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally our primary commercial banking relationship is with citigroup and its global affiliates in addition citibank na an affiliate of citigroup is one of the lead lenders and agent in the syndicate of our  6500 million line of credit 

longterm cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following repayment of debt common stock repurchases the acquisition of businesses software products or technologies complementary to our business and capital expenditures including the purchase and implementation of internaluse software applications 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances are concentrated in a few locations around the world with substantial amounts held outside of the united states as of january 31 2020  approximately 54 of our total cash or cash equivalents and marketable securities are located in foreign jurisdictions and that percentage will fluctuate subject to business needs there are several factors that can impact our ability to utilize foreign cash balances such as foreign exchange restrictions foreign regulatory restrictions company law restrictions such as negative distributable reserves or adverse tax costs we regularly review our capital structure and consider a variety of potential financing alternatives and planning strategies to ensure we have the proper liquidity available in the locations in which it is needed we expect to meet our liquidity needs through a combination of current cash balances ongoing cash flows and external borrowings 

cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the risks detailed in part i item 1a titled “ risk factors ” however based on our current business plan and revenue prospects we believe that our existing balances our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from the date of this annual report 

our revenue earnings cash flows receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for which we have put in place foreign currency contracts as part of our risk management strategy see part ii item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at january 31 2020  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 



 

 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months in addition we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations

we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees including limited product warranties historically costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant but because potential future costs are highly variable we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations 

issuer purchases of equity securities 

autodesks stock repurchase program provides autodesk with the ability to offset the dilution from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and reduce shares outstanding over time and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders under the share repurchase program autodesk may repurchase shares from time to time in open market transactions privatelynegotiated transactions accelerated share repurchase programs tender offers or by other means the share repurchase program does not have an expiration date and the pace and timing of repurchases will depend on factors such as cash generation from operations available surplus the volume of employee stock plan activity remaining shares available in the authorized pool cash requirements for acquisitions economic and market conditions stock price and legal and regulatory requirements 

during the three and twelve months ended january 31 2020  we repurchased 10 million and 27 million shares of our common stock respectively at january 31 2020  147 million shares remained available for repurchase under the repurchase program approved by the board of directors this program does not have a fixed expiration date see part ii  item 8  note 11  “ stock repurchase program ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

foreign currency exchange risk 

our revenue earnings cash flows receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency volatility that exists as part of our ongoing business operations we utilize cash flow hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions in addition we use balance sheet hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables and payables as of january 31 2020 and 2019  we had open cash flow and balance sheet hedge contracts with future settlements generally within one to twelve months contracts were primarily denominated in euros japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars singapore dollars swiss francs swedish krona and czech koruna we do not enter into foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes the notional amount of our option and forward contracts was  172 billion and  138 billion at january 31 2020 and 2019  respectively 

we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue and operating expenses of certain anticipated transactions a sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january 31 2020  indicated that a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 31 2020 and 2019  would increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by 1588 million and 1234 million  respectively a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the dollar from its value at january 31 2020 and 2019  would decrease the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by  1192 million and  983 million  respectively 

interest rate risk 

interest rate movements affect both the interest income we earn on our shortterm investments and the market value of certain longer term securities at january 31 2020  we had 125 billion of cash equivalents and marketable securities including 690 million classified as shortterm marketable securities if interest rates were to move up by 50 or 100 basis points over a twelvemonth period the market value change of our marketable securities would not have a material impact on our results of operations 

other market risk 

from time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies privately held company investments generally are considered inherently risky the technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies see part ii  item 8  note 3   financial instruments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our privately held investments

product development and introduction 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware operating systems and software in addition our customers’ requirements and preferences rapidly evolve as do their expectations of the performance of our software and services to keep pace with these changes we maintain a vigorous program of new product development to address demands in the marketplace for our products 

the software industry has undergone a transition from developing and selling perpetual licenses and onpremises products to cloud mobile and social applications to address this shift autodesk made a strategic decision to shift its business model from selling perpetual licenses to selling subscriptions we discontinued the sale of new commercial licenses of most individual software products in 2016 additionally in june 2017 we commenced a program to incentivize maintenance plan customers to move to subscription plan offerings maintenancetosubscription m2s while at the same time increasing maintenance plan pricing over time for customers that remain on maintenance plans since launching the program over 794000 maintenance 

2019 form 10k 7 

table of contents 

plan customers have converted to subscription plan offerings autodesk seeks to convert the remaining 796100 maintenance plan customers to subscription through this program subscription plan offerings are designed to give our customers increased flexibility with how they use our products and service offerings and to attract a broader range of customers such as projectbased users and small businesses subscriptions represent a combined hybrid offering of desktop software and cloud functionality which provides a deviceindependent collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders 

we dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to further enhance our existing products and to create new solutions and technologies to expand our market opportunity for example in fiscal 2019 we continued and expanded our investments in construction we continued to make investments in the traditional data creation tools to support the design and preconstruction phases while expanding our investment in the areas of site execution with process and project management cloudbased tools recognizing the value of data continuity across the construction lifecycle of design building and operations we made investments in the preconstruction and site execution phases of the project through our cloudbased tools to connect the phases of construction upstream with design we invested in and announced our cloudbased project delivery platform that allows individuals teams and projects to be connected across all phases in a common data platform we anticipate ongoing investments in construction that support preconstruction site execution as well as the handover phase of the project and will continue to invest in connecting workflows and data across the ecosystem of the project 

research and development expenditures were 7250 million or 28 of fiscal 2019 net revenue 7555 million or 37 of fiscal 2018 net revenue and 7661 million or 38 of fiscal 2017 net revenue our software is primarily developed internally however we also use independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities additionally we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing or licensing products and technology from third parties we continually review these investments in an effort to ensure that we are generating sufficient revenue or gaining a competitive advantage to justify their costs 

  

the majority of our research and product development is performed in the united states china singapore canada and the united kingdom however we employ experienced software developers in many of our other locations translation and localization of our products are performed in a number of local markets principally singapore and ireland we generally localize and translate our products into german french italian spanish russian japanese korean and simplified and traditional chinese 

we plan to continue managing significant product development operations internationally over the next several years we believe that our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize product development lower costs and integrate local market knowledge into our development activities we continually assess the significant costs and challenges including intellectual property protection against the benefits of our international development activities 

for further discussion regarding risks from our product development and introduction efforts see item 1a  “ risk factors ” 

marketing and sales 

we sell our products and services globally primarily through indirect channels consisting of distributors and resellers to a lesser extent we also transact directly with our enterprise and named account customers and with customers through our online autodesk branded store our indirect channel model includes both a twotiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a onetiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers we have a network of approximately 1300 resellers and distributors worldwide for fiscal 2019  approximately 71 of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers 

  

we anticipate that our channel mix will continue to change particularly as we scale our online autodesk branded store business and our largest accounts shift towards directonly business models importantly we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the near future we employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our reseller channel with our business strategies our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller networks the loss of or a significant reduction in business with any one of our major distributors or large resellers could harm our business see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion 

sales through our largest distributor tech data corporation and its global affiliates accounted for 35  31  and 30 of our net revenue for fiscal years ended january 31 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively we believe our business is not substantially dependent on tech data our customers through tech data are the resellers and end users who purchase our 

2019 form 10k 8 

table of contents 

products should any of the agreements between us and tech data be terminated for any reason we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue no other distributor reseller or direct customer accounted for 10 or more of our revenue 

our customerrelated operations are divided into three geographic regions the americas europe middle east and africa “emea” and asia pacific “apac” each geographic region is supported by global marketing and sales organizations these organizations develop and manage overall marketing and sales programs and work closely with a network of domestic and international sales offices fiscal 2019 net revenue in the americas emea and apac was 10499 million  41  10343 million  40  and 4856 million  19  respectively we believe that international sales will continue to comprise the majority of our total net revenue adverse economic conditions and currency exchange rates in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue including emerging economies may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance a summary of our financial information by geographic location is found in note 2  “ revenue recognition ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements our international operations and sales subject us to a variety of risks see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion 

we also work directly with reseller and distributor sales organizations computer manufacturers other software developers and peripherals manufacturers in cooperative advertising promotions and tradeshow presentations we employ massmarketing techniques such as webcasts seminars telemarketing direct mailings sponsorships advertising in business and trade journals and social media we have a worldwide user group organization and we have created online user communities dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products and services 

we generate revenue primarily through various offerings that provide recurring revenue under our subscription plan customers can use our software anytime anywhere and get access to the latest updates to previous versions through termbased product subscriptions cloud service offerings and enterprise business agreements with the discontinuation of the sale of perpetual licenses we have transitioned away from selling a mix of perpetual licenses and maintenance plans in favor of a consolidated subscription model however our customers who have previously purchased a perpetual use license for the most recent version of the underlying product are able to renew a previously purchased maintenance plan that provides them with unspecified upgrades when and if available and receive online support during the term of their maintenance contract 

customer and reseller support 

we provide technical support and training to customers through a multitiered support model augmented by direct programs designed to address certain specific customer needs most of our customers receive support and training from the resellers and distributors from which they purchased subscriptions or licenses for our products or services with autodesk in turn providing second tier support to the resellers and distributors other customers are supported directly via selfservice using the autodesk knowledge network which guides customers to answers in our online support assets support forums webinars or to support representatives using a number of different modalities such as social media phone email and webchat we also support our resellers and distributors through technical product training sales training classes webinars and other knowledge sharing programs

sustainability programs 

to help our customers imagine design and make a better world our sustainability initiatives focus our efforts on the areas where we can have the greatest positive impact enabling sustainable practices through our products delivering free sustainabledesign learning and training resources providing software grants to qualifying nonprofits and entrepreneurs and leading by example with our sustainable business practices through our products and services we are supporting our customers to better understand and improve the environmental performance of everything they make 

climate change 

in addressing the global challenges posed by climate change we make it possible for our customers to innovate and respond to associated changes in regulation building code physical climate parameters and other climaterelated developments this effort can directly and indirectly create more demand for existing and new autodesk products and services in the short and longterm furthermore our leadership is committed to taking climate action and that commitment goes handinhand with our values and reputation in the marketplace 

climate change management actions 

to drive continued progress and meet growing demand we continue to expand the solutions education and support we offer helping customers secure a competitive advantage for a lowcarbon future by designing highperformance buildings resilient cities and infrastructure and more efficient transportation and products to continue to grow this market we provide software and support to early stage entrepreneurs and startup companies who are designing clean technologies we plan to expand these offerings in the future based upon demand and opportunity in response to challenges posed by climate change 

internally we are investing in best practices to mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions and climate change risk through investments in renewable energy energy efficiency disaster management and recovery strategies and materials innovation we are on track to meet our sciencebased greenhouse gas reduction target of 43 absolute emissions by 2020 

climate change governance 

with oversight from our ceo the sustainability  foundation team has direct responsibility for setting and implementing our corporate sustainability strategy including our climate change strategy 

emissions performance  other key performance indicators 

by end of fiscal 2018 autodesk had reduced its net greenhouse gas emissions for its operational boundary by 38 from our fiscal year 2009 baseline to 187000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent this reduction was accomplished through increased investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency in our global real estate portfolio and continued transition from physical software delivery to cloud and electronic software delivery more information about our sustainability commitment can be found in our annual sustainability reports which we have published on our website since 2008 our fiscal 2019 sustainability report will be published in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 

philanthropy 

the autodesk foundation the foundation a privately funded 501c3 charity organization established and solely funded by us leads our philanthropic efforts the purpose of the foundation is twofold to support employees to create a better world at work at home and in the community by matching employees volunteer time andor donations to nonprofit organizations and to support organizations and individuals using design to drive positive social and environmental impact in the latter case we use grant funding software donations and training to accomplish this goal selecting the most impactful and innovative organizations around the world thus leading to a better future for our planet on our behalf the foundation also administers a discounted software donation program to nonprofit organizations social and environmental entrepreneurs and others who are developing design solutions that will shape a more sustainable future 

developer programs 

our business and our customers benefit from our relationships with an extensive developer network these developers create and sell their own interoperable products that further enhance the range of integrated solutions available to our customers one of our key strategies is to maintain an openarchitecture design of our software products to facilitate thirdparty development of complementary products and industryspecific software solutions this approach enables customers and third

parties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses we offer several programs that provide strategic investment funding technological platforms user communities technical support forums and events to developers who develop addon applications for our products for example we have created our web services platform autodesk forge the forge platform includes a number of web services that enable software developers to rapidly develop the next generation of applications and experiences that will power the future of making things forge facilitates the development of a single connected ecosystem for integrating autodesk applications with other enterprise web and mobile solutions 

competition 

the markets for our products are highly competitive are subject to rapid change and can have complex interdependencies between many of the larger businesses we strive to increase our competitive separation by investing in research and development allowing us to bring new products to market and create exciting new versions of existing products that offer compelling efficiencies for our customers we also compete through investments in marketing and sales to more effectively reach new customers and better serve existing customers 

our competitors include large global publicly traded companies small geographically focused firms startup firms and solutions produced inhouse by their users our primary global competitors include adobe systems incorporated ansys inc apple inc aveva group plc avid technology inc bentley systems inc dassault systèmes sa and its subsidiary dassault systèmes solidworks corp intergraph corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of hexagon ab msc software corporation nemetschek ag oracle corporation procore technologies inc ptc inc 3d systems corporation siemens plm sony corporation technicolor sa and trimble navigation limited among others 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing power with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the industry is presently undergoing a platform shift from the personal computer to cloud and mobile computing this shift further lowers barriers to entry and poses a disruptive challenge to established software companies the design software market is characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete both from existing competitors and by entry of new competitors with innovative technologies competition is increasingly enhanced by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies and the possibility that competitors in one vertical segment may enter other vertical segments that we serve in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources than we do because of these and other factors competitive conditions in these industries are likely to continue to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which could harm our business see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion of risks regarding competition 

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to better serve customers by offering new products including cloud and mobile computing products whether by internal development or acquisition and to continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to ease of use reliability performance range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation price and training 

intellectual property and licenses 

we maintain an active program to legally protect our investment in technology through intellectual property rights we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions the nature and extent of legal protection associated with each such intellectual property right depends on among other things the type of intellectual property right and the given jurisdiction in which such right arises we believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business 

nonetheless our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws and enforcement of the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws enforcement of intellectual property rights against alleged infringers can sometimes lead to costly litigation and counterclaims our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business 

from time to time we receive claims alleging infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights including patents disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to among other things costly litigation or product shipment delays which could harm our business

we retain ownership of software we develop our combined hybrid offerings include both desktop software and cloud functionality desktop software is licensed to users pursuant to ‘click through’ or signed license agreements containing restrictions on duplication disclosure and transfer cloud software and associated services are provided to users pursuant to online or signed terms of service agreements containing restrictions on access and use 

we believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our intellectual property and the rapid ongoing technological changes in both the computer hardware and software industries we must rely principally upon software engineering and marketing skills to continually maintain and enhance our competitive market position 

while we have recovered some revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of our software solutions we are unable to measure the full extent to which piracy of our software products exists we believe however that software piracy is and can be expected to be a persistent problem that negatively impacts our revenue and financial results we believe that our transition from perpetual use software licenses to a subscriptionbased business model combined with the change from desktop to cloudbased computing will shift the incentives and means by which software is pirated 

in addition through various licensing arrangements we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others we expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing arrangements in the future as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions to support continued development and sales of our products and services some of these licensing arrangements require or may require royalty payments and other licensing fees the amount of these payments and fees may depend on various factors including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments offsetting considerations if any and the degree of use of the licensed technology 

see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion of risks related to protecting our intellectual property 

production and suppliers 

the production of our software products and services involves duplication or hosting of software media the way that we deliver software has evolved during our business model transition for certain cloudbased products we use a combination of colocated hosting facilities and increasingly amazon web services and to a lesser degree other infrastructureasaservice providers we offer customers an electronic software download option for both initial product fulfillment and subsequent product updates customers who choose electronic fulfillment receive the latest version of the software from our vendor’s secure servers customers may also obtain our software through media such as dvds and usb flash drives available from multiple sources the purchase of media and the transfer of the software programs onto media for distribution to customers are performed by us and by licensed subcontractors packaging materials are produced to our specifications by outside sources production is performed in leased facilities operated by independent thirdparty contractors to date we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the production of our software and documentation 

employees 

as of january 31 2019  we employed approximately 9600 people none of our employees in the united states are represented by a labor union in certain foreign countries our employees are represented by work councils we have never experienced any work stoppages and believe our employee relations are good reliance upon employees in other countries entails various risks and changes in these foreign countries such as government instability or regulation unfavorable to foreignowned businesses which could negatively impact our business in the future

geopolitical trends toward nationalism and protectionism and the weakening or dissolution of international trade pacts may increase the cost of or otherwise interfere with conducting business these trends have increased levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and may increase the volatility of global financial markets the impact of such developments on the global economy remains uncertain political instability or adverse political developments in any of the countries in which we do business could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

a financial sector credit crisis could impair credit availability and the financial stability of our customers including our distribution partners and channels a disruption in the financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking partners on which we rely for operating cash management any of these events could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

our strategy to develop and introduce new products and services exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance costs related to product defects and large expenditures each of which may not result in additional net revenue or could result in decreased net revenue 

rapid technological changes as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences characterize the software industry just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry 30 years ago the software industry has undergone a transition from developing and selling perpetual licenses and onpremises products to cloud mobile and social applications customers are also reconsidering the manner in which they purchase software products which requires us to constantly evaluate our business model and strategy in response we are focused on providing solutions to enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative on their projects we devote significant resources to the development of new technologies in addition we frequently introduce new business models or methods that require a considerable investment of technical and financial resources such as our introduction of flexible subscription and service offerings it is uncertain whether these strategies will prove successful or whether we will be able to develop the necessary infrastructure and business models more quickly than our competitors we are making such investments through further development and enhancement of our existing products and services as well as through acquisitions such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs and could result in decreased net revenue or profitability if we are not able to meet customer requirements either with respect to our software or the manner in which we provide such products or if we are not able to adapt our business model to meet our customers requirements our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted 

in particular a critical component of our growth strategy is to have customers of our autocad and autocad lt products expand their portfolios to include our other offerings and cloudbased functionality we want customers using individual autodesk products to expand their portfolio with our other offerings and cloudbased functionality and we are taking steps to accelerate this migration at times sales of our autocad and autocad lt or individual autodesk flagship products have decreased without a corresponding increase in industry collections or cloudbased functionality revenue or without purchases of customer seats to our industry collections should this continue our results of operations will be adversely affected 

our executive management team must act quickly continuously and with vision given the rapidly changing customer expectations and technology advancements inherent in the software industry the extensive and complex efforts required to create useful and widely accepted products and the rapid evolution of cloud computing mobile devices new computing platforms and other technologies such as consumer products although we have articulated a strategy that we believe will fulfill these challenges if we fail to execute properly on that strategy or adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve we may fail to meet our customers expectations fail to compete with our competitors products and technology and lose the confidence of our channel partners and employees this in turn could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our business could suffer as a result of risks costs charges and integration risks associated with strategic acquisitions and investments such as the recent acquisitions of assemble systems inc plangrid inc and buildingconnected inc 

we regularly acquire or invest in businesses software solutions and technologies that are complementary to our business through acquisitions strategic alliances or equity or debt investments for example we recently acquired assemble systems plangrid and buildingconnected the risks associated with such acquisitions include among others the difficulty of assimilating solutions operations and personnel inheriting liabilities such as intellectual property infringement claims the failure to realize anticipated revenue and cost projections the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business in accordance with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the diversion of managements time and attention

in addition such acquisitions and investments involve other risks such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may not be successful in overcoming such risks and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business in addition such acquisitions and investments have in the past and may in the future contribute to potential fluctuations in our quarterly financial results these fluctuations could arise from transactionrelated costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or writeoffs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments these costs or charges could negatively impact our financial results for a given period cause quarter to quarter variability in our financial results or negatively impact our financial results for several future periods 

we are dependent on international revenue and operations exposing us to significant regulatory global economic intellectual property collections currency exchange rate taxation political instability and other risks which could adversely impact our financial results 

we are dependent on our international operations for a significant portion of our revenue international net revenue represented 66 and 64 of our net revenue in fiscal 2019 and 2018  respectively our international revenue including that from emerging economies is subject to general economic and political conditions in foreign markets including conditions in foreign markets resulting from economic and political conditions in the us our revenue is also impacted by the relative geographical and country mix of our revenue over time at times these factors adversely impact our international revenue and consequently our business as a whole our dependency on international revenue makes us much more exposed to global economic and political trends which can negatively impact our financial results even if our results in the us are strong for a particular period 

we anticipate that our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue and as we expand our international development sales and marketing expertise will provide significant support to our overall efforts in countries outside of the us 

risks inherent in our international operations include

some of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above 

the brexit vote has exacerbated and may further exacerbate many of the risks and uncertainties described above the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union could among other potential outcomes adversely affect the tax tax treaty currency operational legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject the withdrawal could also among other potential outcomes disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and significantly disrupt trade between the united kingdom and the european union and other parties there remains significant risk that the united kingdom will exit from the european union without agreement between the european union and united kingdom on terms addressing customs and trade matters further uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the united kingdom european union and the other economies in which we operate 

in addition the current us administration has instituted or proposed changes to foreign trade policy including the negotiation or termination of trade agreements the imposition of tariffs on products imported from certain countries economic sanctions on individuals corporations or countries and other government regulations affecting trade between the united states and other countries in which we do business new or increased tariffs and other changes in us trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries and certain foreign governments including the chinese government have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain us manufactured goods the escalation of protectionist or retaliatory trade measures in either the united states or any other countries in which we do business such as a change in tariff structures export compliance or other trade policies may increase the cost of or otherwise interfere with conducting our business 

even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks

security incidents may compromise the integrity of our or our customers’ offerings services data or intellectual property harm our reputation damage our competitiveness create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results 

as we digitize autodesk and use cloud and webbased technologies to leverage customer data to deliver the total customer experience we are exposed to increased security risks and the potential for unauthorized access to or improper use of our and our customers information like other software offerings and systems ours are vulnerable to security incidents we devote resources to maintain the security and integrity of our systems offerings services and applications online mobile and desktop we accomplish this by enhancing security features conducting penetration tests code hardening releasing security vulnerability updates and accelerating our incident response time despite these efforts we may not prevent security incidents 

hackers regularly have targeted our systems offerings services and applications and we expect them to do so in the future security incidents could disrupt the proper functioning of our systems solutions or services cause errors in the output of our customers work allow unauthorized access to sensitive data or intellectual property including proprietary or confidential information of ours or our customers or cause other destructive outcomes 

the risk of a security incident particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyber terrorists has increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased these threats include but are not limited to identity theft unauthorized access dns attacks wireless network attacks viruses and worms advanced persistent threat apt application centric attacks peertopeer attacks phishing malicious file uploads backdoor trojans and distributed denial of service ddos attacks in addition third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees vendors partners or users to disclose information to gain access to our data or our users’ data and there is the risk of employee contractor or vendor error or malfeasance despite efforts to create security barriers to such threats it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk 

if any of the foregoing security incidents were to occur our reputation may suffer our competitive position may be diminished customers may stop paying for our solutions and services we could face regulator inquiry lawsuits and potential liability and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

increasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws may impact our business or expose us to increased liability 

our strategy to digitize autodesk involves increasing our use of cloud and webbased technologies and applications to leverage customer data to improve our offerings for the benefit of our customers to accomplish this strategy we must collect customer data which may include personal data federal state and foreign government privacy and data security laws apply to the treatment of personal data governments regulators the plaintiffs’ bar privacy advocates and customers have increased their focus on how companies collect process use store share and transmit personal data 

the general data protection regulation gdpr is applicable in all eu member states the gdpr introduced new data protection requirements in the eu and substantial fines for noncompliance in addition in june 2018 california enacted the california consumer privacy act the ccpa which takes effect in january 2020 the ccpa will among other things give california residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used the ccpa was amended in september 2018 and it is unclear whether further modifications will be made to this legislation or how it will be interpreted we cannot yet predict the impact of the ccpa on our business or operations but it may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply 

the gdpr ccpa and other state and global laws and regulations increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data and we have and will continue to put in place additional processes and programs to demonstrate compliance any failure to comply with the gdpr or other data privacy laws could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties any perceived privacy right violation could result in reputational harm thirdparty claims lawsuits or investigations 

additionally we store customer information and content and if our customers fail to comply with contractual obligations or applicable laws it could result in litigation or reputational harm to us the gdpr ccpa other laws and selfregulatory codes may affect our ability to reach current and prospective customers to understand how our offerings and services are being used to respond to customer requests allowed under the laws and to implement our new business models effectively these new laws and regulations would similarly affect our competitors as well as our customers these requirements could impact demand for our offerings and services and result in more onerous contract obligations

we rely on thirdparties to provide us with a number of operational and technical services thirdparty security incidents could expose us to liability harm our reputation damage our competitiveness and adversely impact our financial performance 

we rely on third parties such as amazon web services to provide us with operational and technical services these third parties may have access to our systems provide hosting services or otherwise process data about us or our customers employees or partners any thirdparty security incident could compromise the integrity of or availability or result in the theft of data in addition our operations or the operations of our customers or partners could be negatively affected in the event of a security breach and could be subject to the loss or theft of confidential or proprietary information including source code unauthorized access to data and other confidential or proprietary information may be obtained through breakins network breaches by unauthorized parties employee theft or misuse or other misconduct if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation may suffer our competitive position may be diminished customers may buy fewer of our offerings and services we could face lawsuits and potential liability and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

delays in service from thirdparty service providers could expose us to liability harm our reputation damage our competitiveness and adversely impact our financial performance 

from time to time we may rely on a single or limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country for the provision of various services and materials that we use in the operation of our business and production of our solutions the inability of such third parties to satisfy our requirements could disrupt our business operations or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy if any of these situations were to occur our reputation could be harmed we could be subject to third party liability including under data protection and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

we are investing in resources to update and improve our information technology systems to digitize autodesk and support our customers should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing information technology systems disrupt our operations our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network and data center infrastructure technology systems and our websites for our development marketing operational support sales accounting and financial reporting activities we continually invest resources to update and improve these systems in order to meet the evolving requirements of our business and customers in particular our transition to cloudbased products and a subscriptiononly business model involves considerable investment in the development of technologies as well as backoffice systems for technical financial compliance and sales resources 

such improvements are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or may uncover problems with our existing technology systems unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in disruption in our business operations loss of customers loss of revenue errors in our accounting and financial reporting or damage to our reputation all of which could harm our business 

we may not be able to predict subscription renewal rates and their impact on our future revenue and operating results 

our customers are not obligated to renew their subscriptions for our offerings and they may elect not to renew we cannot assure renewal rates or the mix of subscriptions renewals customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate due to a number of factors including offering pricing competitive offerings customer satisfaction and reductions in customer spending levels or customer activity due to economic downturns or financial markets uncertainty if our customers do not renew their subscriptions or if they renew on less favorable terms our revenues may decline 

our software is highly complex and may contain undetected errors defects or vulnerabilities each of which could harm our business and financial performance 

the software solutions that we offer are complex and despite extensive testing and quality control may contain errors defects or vulnerabilities some errors defects and vulnerabilities in our software solutions may only be discovered after they have been released any errors defects or vulnerabilities could result in the need for corrective releases to our software solutions damage to our reputation loss of revenue an increase in subscription cancellations or lack of market acceptance of our offerings any of which would likely harm our business and financial performance

existing and increased competition and rapidly evolving technological changes may reduce our revenue and profits 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing devices with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the software industry has undergone a transition from developing and selling perpetual licenses and onpremises products to cloud mobile and social applications this shift further lowers barriers to entry and poses a disruptive challenge to established software companies the markets in which we compete are characterized by vigorous competition both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary offerings and technologies in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources furthermore a reduction in the number and availability of compatible thirdparty applications or our inability to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes including those related to cloud computing mobile devices and new computing platforms may adversely affect the sale of our solutions because of these and other factors competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which would likely harm our business 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls  

  

our offerings are subject to us export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations that prohibit the delivery of certain solutions and services without the required export authorizations or export to locations governments and persons targeted by us sanctions while we have processes in place to prevent our offerings from being exported in violation of these laws including obtaining authorizations as appropriate and screening against us government and international lists of restricted and prohibited persons we cannot guarantee that these processes will prevent all violations of export control and sanctions laws 

  

we also note that if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm as well as other negative consequences including government investigations and penalties we presently incorporate export control and sanctions compliance requirements in our channel partner agreements complying with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities violations of us sanctions or export control laws can result in fines or penalties 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the us we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change our exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 

we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our cash flow exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as part of our risk management strategy we use foreign currency contracts to manage a portion of our exposures of underlying assets liabilities and other obligations which exist as part of our ongoing business operations these foreign currency instruments have maturities that extend for one to twelve months in the future and provide us with some protection against currency exposures however our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be completely successful resulting in an adverse impact on our financial results 

the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period although our foreign currency cash flow hedge program extends beyond the current quarter in order to reduce our exposure to foreign currency volatility we do not attempt to completely mitigate this risk and in any case will incur transaction fees in adopting such hedging programs such volatility even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings 

in addition countries in which we operate may be classified as highly inflationary economies requiring special 

accounting and financial reporting treatment for such operations or such countries’ currencies may be devalued or both which may adversely impact our business operations and financial results

if we do not maintain good relationships with the members of our distribution channel our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected if our distribution channel suffers financial losses becomes financially unstable or insolvent or is not provided the right mix of incentives to sell our subscriptions our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected 

we sell our software products both directly to endusers and through a network of distributors and resellers for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018  approximately 71 and 70  respectively of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the near future our ability to effectively distribute our solutions depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller network computer software distributors and resellers typically are not highly capitalized have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and experienced difficulties during the past several years we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of distributors and resellers prior to our sales to them in the past we have taken steps to support them and may take additional steps in the future such as extending credit terms and providing temporary discounts these steps if taken could harm our financial results if our distributors and resellers were to become insolvent they would not be able to maintain their business and sales or provide customer support services which would negatively impact our business and revenue 

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including the distributor tech data tech data accounted for 35 and 31 of our total net revenue for fiscal 2019 and 2018  respectively although we believe that we are not substantially dependent on tech data if tech data were to experience a significant disruption with its business or if our relationship with tech data were to significantly deteriorate it is possible that our ability to sell to end users would be at least temporarily negatively impacted this could in turn negatively impact our financial results 

over time we have modified and will continue to modify aspects of our relationship with our distributors and resellers such as their incentive programs pricing to them and our distribution model to motivate and reward them for aligning their businesses with our strategy and business objectives changes in these relationships and underlying programs could negatively impact their business and harm our business further our distributors and resellers may lose confidence in our business move to competitive products or may not have the skills or ability to support customers the loss of or a significant reduction in business with those distributors or resellers could harm our business in particular if one or more of such distributors or resellers were unable to meet their obligations with respect to accounts payable to us we could be forced to write off such 

accounts and may be required to delay the recognition of revenue on future sales to these customers these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

our financial results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenue and financial results difficult to predict 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so in the future these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines we also provide investors with quarterly and annual financial forwardlooking guidance that could prove to be inaccurate as a result of these fluctuations in addition to the other factors described in this part i item 1a some of the factors that could cause our financial results to fluctuate include

we have also experienced fluctuations in financial results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic or political conditions in particular our financial results in europe during our third quarter are usually affected by a slower summer period and our apac operations typically experience seasonal slowing in our third and fourth quarters 

our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenue and are relatively fixed in the short term accordingly any revenue shortfall below expectations has had and in the future could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability greater than anticipated expenses or a failure to maintain rigorous cost controls would also negatively affect profitability 

because we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from a small number of solutions including our autocadbased software products and collections if these offerings are not successful our revenue will be adversely affected 

we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from sales of subscriptions of a limited number of our offerings including autocad software solutions based on autocad which include our collections that serve specific markets and products that are interoperable with autocad any factor adversely affecting sales of these subscriptions including the product release cycle market acceptance product competition performance and reliability reputation price competition economic and market conditions and the availability of thirdparty applications would likely harm our financial results during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018  combined revenue from our autocad and autocad lt products not including collections having autocad or autocad lt as a component represented 28 and 27 of our total net revenue respectively 

our debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations 

we have 21 billion of debt consisting of notes due at various times from june 2020 to june 2027 and a delayed draw term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of 5000 million due in december 2020 each as described in part 2 item 8 we also entered into a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured revolving loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of 6500 million with an option to be increased up to 10 billion as described in part 2 item 8 maintenance of our indebtedness contractual restrictions and additional issuances of indebtedness could 

 

 

 

 

 

we are required to comply with the covenants set forth in our debt instruments such as an interest coverage ratio in effect january 31 2019 and a leverage ratio in effect july 31 2019 if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or lenders then subject to applicable cure periods we would not be able to incur additional indebtedness under the credit agreement described in part 2 item 8 and any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities under certain circumstances if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under our credit agreement could increase downgrades in our credit ratings could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing

if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights our business could be harmed 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright and trademark laws trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our software is timeconsuming and costly we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software exists and we expect that software piracy will remain a persistent problem particularly in emerging economies furthermore our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 

additionally we actively protect the secrecy of our confidential information and trade secrets including our source code if unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code the loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for thirdparties to compete with our offerings by copying functionality which could adversely affect our financial performance and our reputation we also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of nondisclosure agreements with our customers contractors vendors and partners however it is possible that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization if this were to occur it may be difficult andor costly for us to enforce our rights and our financial performance and reputation could be negatively impacted 

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in the loss of significant rights 

as more software patents are granted worldwide the number of offerings and competitors in our industries grows and the functionality of products in different industries overlaps we expect that software developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims infringement or misappropriation claims have in the past been and may in the future be asserted against us and any such assertions could harm our business additionally certain patent holders without products have become more aggressive in threatening and pursuing litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents any such claims or threats whether with or without merit have been and could in the future be timeconsuming to defend result in costly litigation and diversion of resources cause product delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in addition such royalty or license agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms if at all which would likely harm our business 

from time to time we realign or introduce new business and sales initiatives if we fail to successfully execute and manage these initiatives our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

as part of our effort to accommodate our customers needs and demands and the rapid evolution of technology we from time to time evolve our business and sales initiatives such as realigning our development and marketing organizations offering software as a service and realigning our internal resources in an effort to improve efficiency we may take such actions without clear indications that they will prove successful and at times we have been met with shortterm challenges in the execution of such initiatives market acceptance of any new business or sales initiative is dependent on our ability to match our customers needs at the right time and price often we have limited prior experience and operating history in these new areas of emphasis if any of our assumptions about expenses revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated and our financial results will be negatively impacted 

net revenue arr billings earnings cash flow or subscriptions shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline 

the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including the other factors described in this part i  item 1a and the following

shortterm and longterm impact to our business 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant changes in the price of our common stock could expose us to costly and timeconsuming litigation historically after periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities a company becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts managements attention and resources 

our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our success and ability to invest and grow depend largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical professional managerial sales and marketing personnel historically competition for these key personnel has been intense the loss of services of any of our key personnel including key personnel joining our company through acquisitions the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions and financial goals 

our investment portfolio consists of a variety of investment vehicles in a number of countries that are subject to interest rate trends market volatility and other economic factors if general economic conditions decline this could cause the credit ratings of our investments to deteriorate illiquidity in the financial marketplace and we may experience a decline in interest income and an inability to sell our investments leading to impairment in the value of our investments 

it is our policy to invest our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in highly liquid instruments with and in the custody of financial institutions with high credit ratings and to limit the amounts invested with any one institution type of security and issuer however we are subject to general economic conditions interest rate trends and volatility in the financial marketplace that can affect the income that we receive from our investments the net realizable value of our investments including our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and our ability to sell them any one of these factors could reduce our investment income or result in material charges which in turn could impact our overall net income loss and earnings loss per share 

from time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies privately held company investments are considered inherently risky the technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies 

a loss on any of our investments may cause us to record an otherthantemporary impairment charge the effect of this charge could impact our overall net income loss and earnings loss per share in any of these scenarios our liquidity may be negatively impacted which in turn may prohibit us from making investments in our business taking advantage of opportunities and potentially meeting our financial obligations as they come due

we are subject to legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries and we may be named in additional legal proceedings or become involved in regulatory inquiries in the future all of which are costly distracting to our core business and could result in an unfavorable outcome or a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or the trading prices for our securities 

we are involved in legal proceedings and receive inquiries from regulatory agencies as the global economy has changed and our business has evolved we have seen an increase in litigation activity and regulatory inquiries like many other high technology companies the number and frequency of inquiries from us and foreign regulatory agencies we have received regarding our business and our business practices and the business practices of others in our industry have increased in recent years in the event that we are involved in significant disputes or are the subject of a formal action by a regulatory agency we could be exposed to costly and time consuming legal proceedings that could result in any number of outcomes any claims or regulatory actions initiated by or against us whether successful or not could result in expensive costs of defense costly damage awards injunctive relief increased costs of business fines or orders to change certain business practices significant dedication of management time diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business in any of these cases our financial results results of operations cash flows or the trading prices for our securities could be negatively impacted 

we are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions our effective tax rate is primarily based on our expected geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany arrangements including the manner in which we develop value and license our intellectual property and enacted tax rules significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis while we believe our tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 

tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied for example the us government enacted significant tax law changes in december 2017 the tax act which impacted our tax obligations and effective tax rate beginning in our fiscal 2018 tax year increasingly governmental tax authorities are scrutinizing corporate tax strategies many countries in the european union as well as other countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that if enacted could increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business if us or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge the manner in which our profits are currently recognized our overall taxes could increase and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted 

  

uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the tax act could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate 

the tax act was enacted on december 22 2017 and provides broad and significant changes to the us tax code and how the us imposes income tax on multinational corporations due to the complexity and varying interpretations of the tax act the us department of treasury and other standardsetting bodies have been issuing and will be issuing regulations and interpretative guidance that could significantly impact how we will apply the law and the ultimate impact to our results of operations from the tax act 

the tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously provided for in the us tax law these computations require significant judgments to be made regarding the interpretation of the provisions within the tax act and treasury regulations issued thereunder along with preparation and analysis of information not previously required as additional regulatory guidance is issued we may make amendments to prior year tax returns 

changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business further such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective

we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting the report contains among other matters an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 

if our management or independent registered public accounting firm identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we would be unable to assert that such internal control over financial reporting is effective if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion that our internal controls are effective we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 

in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements which if not accurate may significantly impact our financial results 

we make assumptions judgments and estimates for a number of items including revenue recognition for our hybrid desktop software and cloud service subscriptions the fair value of financial instruments goodwill longlived assets and other intangible assets the realizability of deferred tax assets and the fair value of stock awards we also make assumptions judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee related liabilities including commissions bonuses and sabbaticals and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions partner incentive programs product returns reserves allowances for doubtful accounts asset retirement obligations and legal contingencies these assumptions judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from our estimates and such differences could significantly impact our financial results 

we rely on third party technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies our solutions and service development may be delayed and our financial results negatively impacted 

we rely on certain software that we license from third parties including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our offerings to perform key functions these thirdparty software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and the software may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs or delays until equivalent software can be developed identified licensed and integrated which would likely harm our business 

disruptions with licensing relationships and third party developers could adversely impact our business 

we license certain key technologies from third parties licenses may be restricted in the term or the use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business similarly we may not be able to obtain or renew license agreements for key technology on favorable terms if at all and any failure to do so could harm our business 

our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with thirdparty developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn in particular markets such disruptions have in the past and would likely in the future negatively impact these thirdparty developers and end users which could harm our business 

additionally technology created by outsourced product development whether outsourced to third parties or developed externally and transferred to us through business or technology acquisitions has certain additional risks such as effective integration into existing products adequate transfer of technology knowhow and ownership and protection of transferred intellectual property

as a result of our strategy of partnering with other companies for product development our product delivery schedules could be adversely affected if we experience difficulties with our product development partners 

we partner with certain independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities we believe our partnering strategy allows us to among other things achieve efficiencies in developing new products and maintaining and enhancing existing product offerings our partnering strategy creates a dependency on such independent developers independent developers including those who currently develop solutions for us in the us and throughout the world may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future in addition use of development resources through consulting relationships particularly in nonus jurisdictions with developing legal systems may be adversely impacted by and expose us to risks relating to evolving employment export and intellectual property laws these risks could among other things expose our intellectual property to misappropriation and result in disruptions to product delivery schedules 

our business may be significantly disrupted upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event 

our business is highly automated and relies extensively on the availability of our network and data center infrastructure our internal technology systems and our websites we also rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide to our customers and computer operations for our internal use the failure of our systems or hosted computer services due to a catastrophic event such as an earthquake fire flood tsunami weather event telecommunications failure power failure cyber attack terrorism or war could adversely impact our business financial results and financial condition we have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems in order to reduce the potential impact of a catastrophic event however there can be no assurance that these plans and systems would enable us to return to normal business operations in addition any such event could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products this could in turn decrease that countrys or regions demand for our products thereby negatively impacting our financial results 

if we were required to record an impairment charge related to the value of our longlived assets or an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets our results of operations would be adversely affected 

our longlived assets are tested for impairment if indicators of impairment exist if impairment testing shows that the carrying value of our longlived assets exceeds their estimated fair values we would be required to record a noncash impairment charge which would decrease the carrying value of our longlived assets as the case may be and our results of operations would be adversely affected our deferred tax assets include net operating loss amortizable tax assets and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods each quarter we assess the need for a valuation allowance considering both positive and negative evidence to determine whether all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in fiscal 2016and in fiscal 2018 we determined that it was more likely than not that autodesk would not realize our us and singapore deferred tax assets respectively and established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets we continued to have a full valuation allowance against our us and singapore deferred tax assets in fiscal 2019  changes in the amount of the valuation allowance could result in a material noncash expense or benefit in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted and our results of operations could be materially affected we will continue to perform these tests and any future adjustments may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations

strategy 

autodesk makes software for people who make things if you have ever driven a highperformance car admired a towering skyscraper used a smartphone or watched a great film chances are you have experienced what millions of autodesk customers are doing with our software autodesk gives you the power to make anything 

autodesk was founded during the platform transition from mainframe computers and engineering workstations to personal computers we developed and sustained a compelling value proposition based upon desktop software for the personal computer just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry over 30 years ago the software industry has undergone a transition from developing and selling perpetual licenses and onpremises products to cloud mobile and social applications 

to address this shift autodesk made a strategic decision to shift its business model from selling perpetual licenses and maintenance plans to selling subscriptions 

today we offer subscriptions for individual products and industry collections flexible enterprise business agreements ebas and cloud service offerings collectively referred to as subscription plan subscription plans are designed to give our customers more flexibility with how they use our offerings and to attract a broader range of customers such as projectbased users and small businesses 

our product subscriptions currently represent a hybrid of desktop software and cloud functionality which provides a deviceindependent collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders our cloud offerings for example bim 360 shotgun fusion and autocad 360 pro provide tools including mobile and social capabilities to streamline design collaboration building and manufacturing and data management processes we believe that customer adoption of these new offerings will continue to grow as customers across a range of industries begin to take advantage of the scalable computing power and flexibility provided through these new services 

industry collections provide our customers with increased access to a broader selection of autodesk solutions and services that exceeds those previously available in suites — simplifying the customers ability to get access to a complete set of tools for their industry 

we discontinued the sale of new commercial licenses of most individual software products in 2016 additionally in june 2017 we commenced a program to incentivize maintenance plan customers to move to subscription plan offerings 

2019 form 10k 33 

table of contents 

maintenancetosubscription m2s  while at the same time increasing maintenance plan pricing over time for customers that remain on maintenance plans since launching the program over 794000 maintenance plan customers have converted to subscription plan offerings autodesk seeks to convert the remaining 796100 maintenance plan customers to subscription through this program 

to support our strategic priority of reimagining construction in fiscal 2019 we strengthened the foundation of our construction solutions with both organic and inorganic investments in addition to investing in our bim 360 portfolio we purchased assemble systems for quantity take off functionality plangrid for documentcentric workflows and field execution and buildingconnected for bidding and estimation processes the broadened product portfolio will help us expand our presence with subcontractors trades people and building owners 

as part of our manufacturing strategy we continue to attract global manufacturing leaders with our generative design and our fusion technology enhancements 

we sell our products and services globally through a combination of indirect and direct channels our indirect channels include value added resellers direct market resellers distributors computer manufacturers and other software developers our direct channels include internal sales resources dedicated to selling in our largest accounts our highly specialized solutions and business transacted through our online autodesk branded store see note 2   revenue recognition  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on the results of our indirect and direct channel sales for the fiscal years ended january 31 2019 2018 and 2017 

we anticipate that our channel mix will continue to change as we scale our online autodesk branded store business and our largest accounts shift towards directonly business models however we expect our indirect channel will continue to transact and support the majority of our customers and revenue we employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our direct and indirect channels with our business strategies in addition we have a worldwide user group organization and we have created online user communities dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products 

one of our key strategies is to maintain an openarchitecture design of our software products to facilitate thirdparty development of complementary products and industryspecific software solutions this approach enables customers and third parties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses we offer several programs that provide strategic investment funding technological platforms user communities technical support forums and events to developers who develop addon applications for our products for example we have established the autodesk forge program to support innovators that build solutions to facilitate the development of a single connected ecosystem for the future of how things are designed made and used as well as support ideas that push the boundaries of 3d printing 

in addition to the competitive advantages afforded by our technology our large global network of distributors resellers thirdparty developers customers educational institutions educators and students is a key competitive advantage which has been cultivated over an extensive period of time this network of partners and relationships provides us with a broad and deep reach into volume markets around the world our distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with the resources to purchase deploy learn and support our solutions quickly and easily we have a significant number of registered thirdparty developers who create products that work well with our solutions and extend them for a variety of specialized applications 

autodesk is committed to helping fuel a lifelong passion for making with students of all ages we offer free educational licenses of autodesk software worldwide to students educators and accredited educational institutions we inspire and support beginners with tinkercad a simple online 3d design and 3d printing tool through autodesk design academy we provide secondary and postsecondary school markets hundreds of standardsaligned class projects to support designbased disciplines in science technology engineering digital arts and math steam while using autodesks professionalgrade 3d design engineering and entertainment software used in industry we also have made autodesk design academy curricula available on udemy and coursera our intention is to make autodesk software ubiquitous and the design and making software of choice for those poised to become the next generation of professional users 

our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products technology and businesses for example we recently acquired assemble systems a leading provider of key workflow software solutions plangrid inc a leading provider of construction productivity software and buildingconnected a leading preconstruction platform we believe that the acquisitions of assemble systems plangrid and buildingconnected will enable us to offer a more comprehensive cloudbased construction platform acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers however they entail cost and integration challenges and may in certain instances negatively impact our operating margins we continually

review these tradeoffs in making decisions regarding acquisitions we currently anticipate that we will continue to acquire products technology and businesses as compelling opportunities become available 

in our current business model annualized recurring revenue arr growth of billings and total deferred revenue better reflect business momentum to analyze progress we have disaggregated our growth between the original maintenance model maintenance plan and the subscription plan model maintenance plan subscriptions peaked in the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2016 as we discontinued selling new maintenance plan subscriptions in fiscal 2017 and we expect them to keep declining over time as maintenance plan customers continue to convert to our subscription plans 

our strategy depends upon a number of assumptions including making our technology available to mainstream markets leveraging our large global network of distributors resellers thirdparty developers customers educational institutions and students improving the performance and functionality of our products and adequately protecting our intellectual property if the outcome of any of these assumptions differs from our expectations we may not be able to implement our strategy which could potentially adversely affect our business for further discussion regarding these and related risks see part i  item 1a  “ risk factors ” 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we regularly reevaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in part ii  item 8  note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we believe that of all our significant accounting policies the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition autodesk’s revenue is divided into three categories subscription revenue maintenance revenue and other revenue revenue is recognized when control for these offerings is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for products and services 

our contracts with customers may include promises to provide multiple subscriptions and services to a customer determining whether the offerings and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or as one combined performance obligation may require significant judgment judgment is required to determine the level of integration and interdependency between individual components of software and cloud functionality this determination influences whether the software is considered distinct and accounted for separately as a license performance obligation or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud functionality as a single subscription performance obligation recognized over time 

for product subscriptions industry collections and enterprise business agreement eba subscriptions in which the desktop software and related cloud functionality are highly interrelated the combined performance obligation is recognized ratably over the contract term as the obligation is satisfied for contracts involving distinct software licenses the license performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer for standalone maintenance subscriptions cloud subscriptions and technical support services the performance obligation is satisfied ratably over the contract term as those services are delivered for consulting services the performance obligation is satisfied over a period of time as those services are delivered 

when an arrangement includes multiple performance obligations which are concurrently delivered and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer the services transfer to the customer over the contract period we account for those performance obligations as a single performance obligation 

for contracts with more than one performance obligation the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations in an amount that depicts the relative standalone selling price ssp of each obligation judgment is required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount that should be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and services 

2019 form 10k 35 

table of contents 

in instances where ssp is not directly observable such as when we do not sell the product or service separately we determine the ssp using information that includes market conditions and other observable inputs we typically have more than one ssp for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customer and circumstance in these instances we use relevant information such as the sales channel and geographic region to determine the ssp 

our indirect channel model includes both a twotiered distribution structure where autodesk sells to distributors that subsequently sell to resellers and a onetiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers for these arrangements transfer of control begins at the time access to our subscriptions is made available electronically to our end customer provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met judgment is required to determine whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to pay regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers if we were to change this assessment it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

as part of the indirect channel model we have a partner incentive program that uses quarterly attainment of monetary rewards to motivate distributors and resellers to achieve mutually agreed upon business goals in a specified time period incentives related to our subscription program are recorded as a reduction to deferred revenue in the period the subscription transaction is billed and are subsequently recognized as a reduction to subscription revenue over the contract period a small portion of partner incentives reduce other revenue in the current period these incentive balances do not require significant assumptions or judgments depending on how the payments are made the reserves associated with the partner incentive program are recorded on the balance sheet as either contra accounts receivable or accounts payable 

the new revenue recognition standard had a material impact in our consolidated financial statements refer to part ii  item 8  note 1  business and summary of significant accounting policies  accounting standards adopted  of our consolidated financial statements and to discussions below under the heading “overview” for additional information 

marketable securities and privately held company investments as described in part ii  item 8  note 3  “ financial instruments ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements our investments in marketable securities are measured at the end of each reporting period and reported at fair value fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date in determining the fair value of our investments we are sometimes required to use various alternative valuation techniques inputs to valuation techniques are either observable or unobservable observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions these two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy 

 

 

 

this hierarchy requires us to minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to use observable market data if available when determining fair value this is generally true for our cash and cash equivalents and the majority of our marketable securities which we consider to be level 1 assets and level 2 assets 

privately held debt and equity securities level 3 are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity these assumptions are inherently subjective and involve significant management judgment whenever possible we use observable market data and rely on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available when determining fair value 

the carrying value is not adjusted for our privately held equity securities if there are no observable price changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may indicate impairment as discussed below in determining the estimated fair value of its strategic investments in privately held companies we utilize the most recent data available to us in addition the determination of whether an orderly transaction is for a same or similar investment requires significant management judgment including the rights and obligations of the investments the 

2019 form 10k 36 

table of contents 

extent to which those differences would affect the fair values of those investments and the impact of any differences based on the stage of operational development of the investee 

all of autodesk’s marketable securities and privately held company investments are subject to a periodic impairment review for any marketable debt securities declines in fair value judged to be otherthantemporary on securities available for sale are included as a reduction to investment income to determine whether a decline in value is otherthantemporary we evaluate among other factors the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than the carrying value and its intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value for the purposes of computing realized and unrealized gains and losses the cost of securities sold is based on the specificidentification method interest on securities classified as available for sale is also included as a component of investment income 

for autodesks quarterly impairment assessment of privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio the analysis encompasses an assessment of the severity and duration of the impairment and qualitative and quantitative analysis of other key factors including the investee’s financial metrics the investee’s products and technologies meeting or exceeding predefined milestones market acceptance of the product or technology other competitive products or technology in the market general market conditions management and governance structure of the investee the investee’s liquidity debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash if the investment is considered to be impaired the company will record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statement of operations and establishing a new carrying value for the investment 

business combinations the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recorded based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations 

although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain examples of critical estimates used in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to 

 

 

 

 

these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results 

realizability of longlived assets we assess the realizability of our longlived assets and related intangible assets other than goodwill quarterly or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review significant underperformance of a business or product line relative to budget shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends and the results of past impairment reviews when such events or changes in circumstances occur we assess recoverability of these assets 

we assess recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows we would perform a discounted cash flow analysis to assess impairments on longlived assets variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge impairment charges if any result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values 

2019 form 10k 37 

table of contents 

in addition to our recoverability assessments we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our longlived assets any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made as well as in subsequent quarters 

we will continue to evaluate the values of our longlived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability approach under this method deferred tax assets including those related to tax loss carryforwards and credits and deferred tax liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we recognize the tax benefit for an uncertain tax position when it meets a more likely than not threshold we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense 

a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be recovered the valuation allowance is determined by assessing both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable such assessment is required on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis significant judgment is required in determining whether the valuation allowance should be recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income as a result of cumulative losses arising from our transition to a subscription model we considered cumulative losses as a significant source of negative evidence and recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax attributes in singapore canada and the us jurisdictions 

as we continually strive to optimize our overall business model tax planning strategies may become feasible and prudent whereby management may determine that it is more likely than not that the federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized therefore we will continue to evaluate the evidence around our ability to utilize our net deferred tax assets each quarter both in the us and in foreign jurisdictions based on all available evidence both positive and negative 

stockbased compensation  we measure stockbased compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award and recognize expense ratably over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period we estimate the fair value of certain stockbased payment awards including grants of employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan using either the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model or a binomiallattice model eg monte carlo simulation model to determine the grantdate fair value of our stockbased payment awards we use a blackscholes model or the quoted stock price on the date of grant unless the awards are subject to market conditions in which case we use the monte carlo simulation model the monte carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables to estimate the probability that market conditions will be achieved these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors the riskfree interest rate for the expected term of the award and expected dividends the variables used in these models are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted as needed sharebased compensation cost for restricted stock is measured on the closing fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

legal contingencies  as described in part i  item 3  “ legal proceedings ” and part ii  item 8  note 9  “ commitments and contingencies ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations 

restructuring and other exit costs net  our restructuring plans include one–time termination benefits as well as certain contractual termination benefits we record costs associated with exit activities related to restructuring plans in accordance with the asc topic 420 exit or disposal obligations  liabilities for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred the timing of associated cash payments is dependent upon the type of exit cost and may extend over a 12month period or longer we record restructuring liabilities in “other accrued liabilities” or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 

restructuring and other exit costs net includes employee termination costs facility closure accelerated depreciation of certain assets and relocation costs and contract termination costs one–time termination benefits are recognized as a liability at

estimated fair value when the approved plan of termination has been communicated to employees unless employees must provide future service that is longer than the statutory requirement in which case the benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period for the facilityrelated restructuring we recognize upon exiting all or a portion of a leased facility and meeting ceaseuse and other requirements the amount of restructuring is based on the fair value of the lease obligation for the abandoned space which includes a sublease assumption that could be reasonably obtained we also recognize accelerated depreciation related to assets at the time we commit to a plan to abandon 

restructuring and other exit costs net requires significant estimates and assumptions including sublease income and expenses for severance and other employee separation costs our estimates involve a number of risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control including future real estate market conditions and our ability to successfully enter into subleases or termination agreements with terms as favorable as those assumed when arriving at our estimates we monitor these estimates and assumptions on at least a quarterly basis for changes in circumstances and any corresponding adjustments to the accrual are recorded in our statement of operations in the period when such changes are known

revenue analysis 

during fiscal 2019  net revenue increased 25  as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to a 102 increase in subscription revenue the increase in subscription revenue was partially offset by a 36 decrease in maintenance revenue 

further discussion of the drivers of these results are discussed below under the heading “results of operations” 

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including tech data corporation and its global affiliates collectively “tech data” total sales to tech data accounted for 35  31  and 30 of autodesks total net revenue during fiscal 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively our customers through tech data are the resellers and end users who purchase our software subscription services should any of our agreements with tech data be terminated for any reason we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue consequently we believe our business is not substantially dependent on tech data 

recurring revenue and subscriptions 

in order to help better understand our financial performance we use several metrics including recurring revenue arr total subscriptions and annualized revenue per subscription arps arr arps total subscriptions and recurring revenue are performance metrics and should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as arr arps total

subscriptions and recurring revenue are not intended to be combined with those items our determination and presentation may differ from that of other companies please refer to the glossary of terms for the definitions of these metrics 

the following table outlines our recurring revenue metric for the fiscal years ended january 31 2019  2018  and 2017  



  

 

the following table outlines our arr subscriptions and arps metrics as of fiscal years ended january 31 2019 and 2018 for purposes of clarification the arr and arps balances in the following table as of january 31 2019 are calculated under asc topic 606 for comparison of arr and arps as of january 31 2019 under the old revenue standard asc topic 605 refer to the table under the title impact of new revenue accounting standard further below 



  

 

total arr increased 34 as of january 31 2019 as compared to the end of fiscal 2018 primarily due to a 87 increase in subscription plan arr driven by product subscriptions including the m2s program the increase was partially offset by a 38 decrease in maintenance plan arr driven by the migration from maintenance plan subscriptions to subscription plan subscriptions under asc 605 total arr increased 32 as compared to the end of the prior fiscal year primarily due to an 84 increase in subscription plan arr partially offset by a 36 decrease in maintenance plan arr 

subscription plan subscriptions increased 56 or approximately 13 million as compared to the end of fiscal 2018 driven by growth in all subscription plan types led by new product subscriptions subscription plan subscriptions benefited from

table of contents 

approximately 452000 maintenance subscribers that were converted to product subscription under the maintenancetosubscription program during the fiscal year ended january 31 2019  

maintenance plan subscriptions decreased 45 or approximately 652800 as compared to the end of fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of the strong performance of the m2s program in which approximately 452000 maintenance plan subscriptions converted to product subscription during the fiscal year ended january 31 2019  the net decrease is expected and we expect to see ongoing declines in maintenance plan subscriptions going forward as part of the business model transition the rate of decline will vary based on the number of subscriptions subject to renewal the renewal rate and our ability to incentivize customers to switch over to ebas or product subscriptions 

as of january 31 2019  when adjusted for the impact of the m2s program subscription plan arps and maintenance plan arps would have been 631 and 641 respectively 

arps as of january 31 2019 was 635 under asc 606 a 15 increase compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to an increase in subscription plan arps the increase in subscription plan arps was driven by growth in all subscription plan types led by product subscription arps under asc 605 arps was 628 as of january 31 2019 

our arps is currently and will continue to be affected by various factors including the m2s program geography and product mix promotions acquisitions sales linearity within a quarter pricing changes and foreign currency

impact of new revenue accounting standard 

effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we adopted accounting standard update no 201409 which codified new revenue recognition guidance under asc topic 606 previously we followed revenue accounting guidance under asc topic 605 under the modified retrospective adoption autodesk calculated the impact of the adoption during fiscal 2019 as the first year of adoption the table below shows what some of our key metrics would have been under asc topic 605 see part ii  item 8  note 1  “ business and summary of significant accounting policies ” for more details on our adoption and impacts 



 

 

the adoption of asc topic 606 required a change to our reporting of deferred revenue see discussions below under the heading total deferred revenue

foreign currency analysis 

we generate a significant amount of our revenue in the united states germany japan the united kingdom and canada 

the following table shows the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on our net revenue and total spend 

  

 

changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue total spend and income loss from operations in future periods we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on a portion of the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions but do not attempt to completely mitigate the impact of fluctuations of such foreign currency against the us dollar 

total deferred revenue 

the adoption of asc topic 606 required a change to the definition of unbilled deferred revenue and new qualitative and quantitative disclosures around our performance obligations unbilled deferred revenue represents contractually stated or committed orders under early renewal and multiyear billing plans primarily for subscription services and maintenance for which the associated deferred revenue has not been recognized under asc topic 606 unbilled deferred revenue is not included as a receivable or deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet see part ii  item 8  note 2  “ revenue recognition ” for more details on autodesks performance obligations 



  

we expect that the amount of billed and unbilled deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons including the specific timing duration and size of customer subscription and support agreements varying billing cycles of such agreements the specific timing of customer renewals and foreign currency fluctuations 

balance sheet and cash flow items 

at january 31 2019  we had  9536 million in cash and marketable securities our cash flow from operations increased to 3771 million for the fiscal year ended january 31 2019 from 09 million for the fiscal year ended january 31 2018  we repurchased 22 million shares of our common stock for  2925 million during fiscal 2019  comparatively we repurchased 69 million shares of our common stock for  6901 million during fiscal 2018  further discussion regarding the balance sheet and cash flow activities are discussed below under the heading “liquidity and capital resources”

we believe that international revenue will continue to comprise a majority of our net revenue unfavorable economic conditions in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue including in emerging economies such as brazil russia india and china may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies have significantly affected and could continue to significantly affect our financial results for a given period even though we hedge a portion of our current and projected revenue increases to the levels of political and economic unpredictability in the global market may impact our future financial results

marketing and sales expenses include salaries bonuses benefits and stockbased compensation expense for our marketing and sales employees the expense of travel entertainment and training for such personnel sales and dealer commissions and the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue such as advertising trade shows and expositions and various sales and promotional programs marketing and sales expenses also include payment processing fees the cost of supplies and equipment gains and losses on our operating expense cash flow hedges allocated it and facilities costs and labor costs associated with sales and order management

interest and other expense net 

the following table sets forth the components of interest and other expense net 



interest and other expense net positively changed by  305 million during fiscal 2019  as compared to fiscal 2018  primarily driven by curtailment gains on our pension plans marktomarket gains on certain of our privatelyheld strategic investments realized gains on sales of strategic investments offset by an increase in interest expense resulting from our term loan entered into on december 17 2018 in aggregate principal amount of 500 million and marktomarket losses on marketable securities 

interest and other expense net increased  240 million during fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  primarily related to increases in impairment losses on certain of our privatelyheld strategic investments and interest expense resulting from our june 2017 issuance of  5000 million aggregate principal amount of 35 notes due june 15 2027  

interest expense and investment income fluctuates based on average cash marketable securities and debt balances average maturities and interest rates 

gains and losses on foreign currency are primarily due to the impact of remeasuring foreign currency transactions and net monetary assets into the functional currency of the corresponding entity the amount of the gain or loss on foreign currency is driven by the volume of foreign currency transactions and the foreign currency exchange rates for the year 

provision for income taxes 

we account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse 

income tax expense was 381 million and 96 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018  respectively relative to pretax losses of 427 million and 5573 million  respectively for the same periods tax expense for fiscal 2019 consists primarily of foreign tax expense including withholding tax and tax amortization on indefinitelived intangibles offset by a benefit for the release of uncertain tax positions upon finalization of irs examination during the current fiscal year in addition we had a tax benefit from the release of valuation allowance from acquired deferred tax liabilities during the current fiscal year tax expense for fiscal 2018 consisted primarily of foreign tax expense including withholding tax and tax amortization on indefinitelived intangibles offset by the revaluation of our deferred tax liability due to the corporate rate reduction under the tax act we recorded a tax benefit of the tax act in our financial statements as of january 31 2018 of approximately 323 million mainly driven by the corporate rate remeasurement of the indefinitelived intangible deferred tax liability 

the tax act was signed into law on december 22 2017 and provided broad and significant changes to the us corporate income tax regime in light of our fiscal yearend the tax act reduced the statutory federal corporate rate from 35 to 3381 for fiscal 2018 and to 21 for fiscal 2019 and forward the tax act also among many other provisions imposed a onetime mandatory tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries commonly referred to as the transition tax subjected the deemed intangible income of our foreign subsidiaries to current us taxation commonly referred to as gilti provided for a full dividends received deduction upon repatriation of untaxed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries imposed a minimum taxation without most tax credits on modified taxable income which is generally taxable income without deductions for payments to related foreign companies commonly referred to as “beat” modified the accelerated depreciation deduction rules and made updates to the deductibility of certain expenses we have completed our determination of the accounting implications of the tax act on our tax accruals 

2019 form 10k 51 

table of contents 

as of january 31 2018 we estimated taxable income associated with offshore earnings of 8315 million and as of january 31 2019 we adjusted the taxable income to 8196 million to reflect the impact of treasury regulations issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 transition tax related to adjustments in offshore earnings resulted in no impact to the effective tax rate as it is primarily offset by net operating losses that are subject to a full valuation allowance as a result of the transition tax we recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately 451 million for foreign tax credits which are also subject to a full valuation allowance 

we are subject to gilti in fiscal 2019 primarily offset by current year operating losses resulting in no impact to the effective tax rate 

we anticipate that the us department of treasury and other standardsetting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the tax act will be applied or otherwise administered as future guidance is issued we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our financial statements in the period in which the adjustments are made 

a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be recovered the valuation allowance is determined by assessing both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable such assessment is required on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis significant judgment is required in determining whether the valuation allowance should be recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we considered recent cumulative losses in the us arising from our business model transition as a significant source of negative evidence considering this negative evidence and the absence of sufficient positive objective evidence that we would generate sufficient taxable income in the us to realize the deferred tax assets we determined that it was more likely than not that we would not realize the us federal and state deferred tax assets and recorded a full valuation allowance furthermore in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 our singapore operation similar to the us incurred cumulative losses and recorded a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset as we continually strive to optimize our overall business model tax planning strategies may become feasible whereby management may determine that it is more likely than not that the federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized as a result we will continue to evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax assets each quarter both in the us and in foreign jurisdictions based on all available evidence both positive and negative 

as of january 31 2019  we had  2090 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which  1906 million would reduce our valuation allowance if recognized the remaining 184 million would impact the effective tax rate it is possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months however an estimate of the range of the possible change cannot be made at this time 

our future effective annual tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate changes in valuation allowances level of profit before tax accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits and changes in tax laws including impacts of the tax act a significant amount of our earnings is generated by our europe and asia pacific subsidiaries our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates 

at january 31 2019  we had noncurrent foreign net deferred tax assets of 543 million that management believes are more likely than not to be realized in future years

other financial information 

in addition to our results determined under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” discussed above we believe the following nongaap measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the fiscal years ended january 31 2019  2018  and 2017  our gross profit gross margin loss income from operations operating margin net loss income diluted net loss income per share and diluted shares used in per share calculation on a gaap and nongaap basis were as follows in millions except for gross margin operating margin and per share data 



  

for our internal budgeting and resource allocation process and as a means to provide consistency in periodtoperiod comparisons we use nongaap measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis these nongaap measures do not include certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results we also use nongaap measures in making operating decisions because we believe those measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our earning potential and performance for management by excluding certain benefits credits expenses and charges that may not be indicative of our core business operating results for the reasons set forth below we believe these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors both because 1 they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and 2 they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business this allows investors and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management compare financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the longterm performance of our core business we also use some of these measures for purposes of determining companywide incentive compensation 

there are limitations in using nongaap financial measures because nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies the nongaap financial measures included above are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results in addition they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the nongaap financial measures we compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a gaap basis as well as a nongaap basis and also by providing gaap measures in our public disclosures the presentation of nongaap financial information is meant to be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or in isolation from the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap we urge investors to review the reconciliation of our nongaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures included below and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business

our nongaap financial measures may exclude the following 

stockbased compensation expenses we exclude stockbased compensation expenses from nongaap measures primarily because they are noncash expenses and management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods moreover because of varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under fasb asc topic 718 we believe excluding stockbased compensation expenses allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies 

amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangibles we incur amortization of acquisitionrelated developed technology and purchased intangibles in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangibles is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions management finds it useful to exclude these variable charges from our cost of revenues to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangible assets will recur in future periods 

ceo transition costs we exclude amounts paid to the companys former ceos upon departure under the terms of their transition agreements including severance payments acceleration of restricted stock units and continued vesting of performance stock units and legal fees incurred with the transition also excluded from our nongaap measures are recruiting costs related to the search for a new ceo these costs represent nonrecurring expenses and are not indicative of our ongoing operating expenses we further believe that excluding the ceo transition costs from our nongaap results is useful to investors in that it allows for periodoverperiod comparability 

goodwill impairment this is a noncash charge to writedown goodwill to fair value when there was an indication that the asset was impaired as explained above management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

restructuring and other exit costs net these expenses are associated with realigning our business strategies based on current economic conditions in connection with these restructuring actions or other exit actions we recognize costs related to termination benefits for former employees whose positions were eliminated the closure of facilities and cancellation of certain contracts we exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing business and operating results we believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses 

2019 form 10k 55 

table of contents 

acquisition related costs we exclude certain acquisition related costs including due diligence costs professional fees in connection with an acquisition certain financing costs and certain integration related expenses these expenses are unpredictable and dependent on factors that may be outside of our control and unrelated to the continuing operations of the acquired business or our company in addition the size and complexity of an acquisition which often drives the magnitude of acquisition related costs may not be indicative of such future costs we believe excluding acquisition related costs facilitates the comparison of our financial results to the companys historical operating results and to other companies in our industry 

gain loss on strategic investments and dispositions we exclude gains and losses related to our strategic investments and dispositions from our nongaap measures primarily because management finds it useful to exclude these variable gains and losses on these investments and dispositions in assessing our financial results included in these amounts are noncash unrealized gains and losses on the derivative components dividends received realized gains and losses on the sales or losses on the impairment of these investments and dispositions we believe excluding these items is useful to investors because these excluded items do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business and these losses or gains were incurred in connection with strategic investments and dispositions which do not occur regularly 

discrete tax items we exclude the gaap tax provision including discrete items from the nongaap measure of net loss income and include a nongaap tax provision based upon the projected annual nongaap effective tax rate discrete tax items include income tax expenses or benefits that do not relate to ordinary income from continuing operations in the current fiscal year unusual or infrequently occurring items or the tax impact of certain stockbased compensation examples of discrete tax items include but are not limited to certain changes in judgment and changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years certain costs related to business combinations certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets or changes in tax law management believes this approach assists investors in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations we believe the exclusion of these discrete tax items provides investors with useful supplemental information about our operational performance 

establishment of a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets this is a noncash charge to record a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets as explained above management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various cash expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

income tax effects on the difference between gaap and nongaap costs and expenses the income tax effects that are excluded from the nongaap measures relate to the tax impact on the difference between gaap and nongaap expenses primarily due to stockbased compensation amortization of purchased intangibles and restructuring charges and other exit costs benefits for gaap and nongaap measures 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of cash is from the sale of our software and related services our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employeerelated expenses such as compensation and benefits as well as general operating expenses for marketing facilities and overhead costs in addition to operating expenses we also use cash to fund our stock repurchase program and invest in our growth initiatives which include acquisitions of products technology and businesses see further discussion of these items below 

at january 31 2019  our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  9536 million and net accounts receivable of 4743 million  

on december 17 2018 autodesk entered into a new credit agreement the “credit agreement” for an unsecured revolving loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of 6500 million  with an option to request increases in the amount of the credit facility by up to an additional 3500 million  the credit agreement replaced and terminated our 4000 million amended and restated credit agreement the maturity date on the line of credit facility is december 2023  at january 31 2019  autodesk had no outstanding borrowings on this line of credit as of march 25 2019  we have no amounts outstanding under the credit facility see part ii  item 8  note 8   borrowing arrangements  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our covenant requirements if we are unable to remain in compliance with the covenants we will not be able to draw on our credit facility 

on december 17 2018 we also entered into a term loan agreement the “term loan agreement” which provided for a delayed draw term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of  5000 million  on december 19 2018 we borrowed a 5000 million term loan under the term loan agreement in connection with the acquisition of plangrid see part ii  item 8

in addition to the term loan as of january 31 2019  we have  16 billion aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding see part ii  item 8  note 8   borrowing arrangements  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

our cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally our primary commercial banking relationship is with citigroup and its global affiliates in addition citibank na an affiliate of citigroup is one of the lead lenders and agent in the syndicate of our  6500 million line of credit 

longterm cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following repayment of debt common stock repurchases the acquisition of businesses software products or technologies complementary to our business and capital expenditures including the purchase and implementation of internaluse software applications 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances are concentrated in a few locations around the world with substantial amounts held outside of the united states as of january 31 2019  approximately 52 of our total cash or cash equivalents and marketable securities are located in foreign jurisdictions and that percentage will fluctuate subject to business needs there are several factors that can impact our ability to utilize foreign cash balances such as foreign exchange restrictions foreign regulatory restrictions or adverse tax costs the tax act includes a mandatory onetime tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and generally eliminates us taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions in future periods as a result earnings in foreign jurisdictions are generally available for distribution to the us with little to no incremental us taxes we regularly review our capital structure and consider a variety of potential financing alternatives and planning strategies to ensure we have the proper liquidity available in the locations in which it is needed we expect to meet our liquidity needs through a combination of current cash balances ongoing cash flows and external borrowings 

cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the risks detailed in part i item 1a titled “ risk factors ” however based on our current business plan and revenue prospects we believe that our existing balances our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months 

our revenue earnings cash flows receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for which we have put in place foreign currency contracts as part of our risk management strategy see part ii item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion 



net cash provided by operating activities of 3771 million for fiscal 2019 consisted of 3718 million of noncash expenses including stockbased compensation expense restructuring charges net depreciation amortization and accretion expense offsetting our net loss of 808 million  and included 861 million of cash flow provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities 

the primary working capital source of cash was an increase in deferred revenue from 19551 million as of january 31 2018  to 20914 million as of january 31 2019  the primary working capital uses of cash were decreases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities 

net cash used in investing activities was 7104 million for fiscal 2019 and was primarily due to acquisitions net of cash acquired and purchases of marketable securities these cash outflows were partially offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities

net cash provided by financing activities was 1519 million in fiscal 2019 and was primarily due to proceeds from debt issuance net of discount and proceeds from issuance of stock these cash inflows were partially offset by repurchases of our common stock and taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months in addition we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees including limited product warranties historically costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant but because potential future costs are highly variable we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations 

issuer purchases of equity securities 

autodesks stock repurchase program provides autodesk with the ability to offset the dilution from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and reduce shares outstanding over time and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders under the share repurchase program autodesk may repurchase shares from time to time in open market transactions privatelynegotiated transactions accelerated share repurchase programs tender offers or by other means the share repurchase program does not have an expiration date and the pace and timing of repurchases will depend on factors such as cash generation from operations available surplus the volume of employee stock plan activity remaining shares available in the authorized pool cash requirements for acquisitions economic and market conditions stock price and legal and regulatory requirements 

during the three and twelve months ended january 31 2019  we repurchased 02 million and 22 million shares of our common stock respectively at january 31 2019  174 million shares remained available for repurchase under the repurchase program approved by the board of directors this program does not have a fixed expiration date see part ii  item 8  note 10  “ stockholders deficit equity ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our revenue earnings cash flows receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency volatility that exists as part of our ongoing business operations we utilize cash flow hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions in addition we use balance sheet hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables and payables as of january 31 2019  and 2018  we had open cash flow and balance sheet hedge contracts with future settlements within one to twelve months contracts were primarily denominated in euros japanese yen british pounds canadian dollars australian dollars singapore dollars swiss francs swedish krona and czech krona we do not enter into foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes the notional amount of our option and forward contracts was  13833 million and  9495 million at january 31 2019  and 2018  respectively 

we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue and operating expenses of certain anticipated transactions a sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january 31 2019  indicated that a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 31 2019 and 2018 would increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by 1234 million and 579 million  respectively a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the dollar from its value at january 31 2019  and 2018 would decrease the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by  983 million and  832 million  respectively 

interest rate risk 

interest rate movements affect both the interest income we earn on our shortterm investments and the market value of certain longer term securities at january 31 2019  we had 4437 million of cash equivalents and marketable securities including 676 million classified as shortterm marketable securities if interest rates were to move up by 50 or 100 basis points over a twelve month period the market value change of our marketable securities would not have a meaningful unrealized gain or loss 

in december 2018 we entered into a 5000 million term loan facility all of which was outstanding as of january 31 2019  the term loan bears interest at autodesks option at either i a floating rate per annum equal to the base rate plus a margin between 0000 and 0625  depending on autodesks public debt rating or ii a per annum rate equal to the rate at which dollar deposits are offered in the london interbank market plus a margin of between 0875 and 1625 depending on autodesks public debt rating based on autodesks current credit ratings the term loan bears interest at a per annum rate equal to the rate at which dollar deposits are offered in the london interbank market plus a margin of 1125 per annum a hypothetical increase or decrease of 50 or 100 basis points would not have a material impact on our results of operations the term loan facility matures in december 2020  

other market risk 

from time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies privately held company investments generally are considered inherently risky the technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies see part ii  item 8  note 3   financial instruments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our privately held investments

our management has concluded that as of january 31 2019  our internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in item 8 herein

product development and introduction 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware operating systems and software in addition our customers’ requirements and preferences rapidly evolve as do their expectations of the performance of our software and services to keep pace with these changes we maintain a vigorous program of new product development to address demands in the marketplace for our products 

the software industry is undergoing a transition from the personal computer to cloud social and mobile computing in fiscal 2018 we continued to successfully implement a strategic transition of our business model announced in fiscal 2014 to support our transition effective february 1 2016 we discontinued the sale of new commercial seats of most individual software products which are now exclusively available by desktop subscription and discontinued selling perpetual licenses of suites while introducing industry collections effective august 1 2016 industry collections allow access to a broad set of products and cloud services th at exceeds those previously available in suites  simplifying the customers ability to access a complete set of industry tools additionally on june 15 2017 we commenced a program to incentivize maintenance plan customers to move to subscription plan offerings through this program we offer discounts to those maintenance plan customers that move to subscription plan offerings while at the same time increasing maintenance plan pricing over time for customers that remain on maintenance plans subscription plan offerings are designed to give our customers increased flexibility with how they use our products and service offerings and to attract a broader range of customers such as projectbased users and small businesses subscriptions represent a combined hybrid offering of desktop software and cloud functionality which provides a deviceindependent collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders 

we dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to further enhance our existing products and to create new products and technologies to expand our market opportunity for example in fiscal 2018 we continued and expanded our investments in construction we continued to make investments in the traditional data creation tools to support the design and preconstruction phases while expanding our investment in the areas of site execution with process and project management cloudbased tools recognizing the value of data continuity across the construction lifecycle of design building and operations we made investments in the handover and operations phase of the project through our cloudbased tools to connect the phases of construction upstream with design we invested in and announced our cloudbased project delivery platform that allows individuals teams and projects to be connected across all phases in a common data platform we anticipate ongoing investments in construction that support preconstruction site execution as well as the handover phase of the project and will continue to invest in connecting workflows and data across the ecosystem of the project

research and development expenditures were 7555 million or 37 of fiscal 2018 net revenue 7661 million or 38 of fiscal 2017 net revenue and 7900 million or 32 of fiscal 2016 net revenue our software is primarily developed internally however we also use independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities additionally we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing or licensing products and technology from third parties we continually review these investments in an effort to ensure that we are generating sufficient revenue or gaining a competitive advantage to justify their costs 

  

the majority of our research and product development is performed in the united states china singapore canada and the united kingdom however we employ experienced software developers in many of our other locations translation and localization of our products are performed in a number of local markets principally singapore and switzerland we generally localize and translate our products into german french italian spanish russian japanese korean and simplified and traditional chinese 

we plan to continue managing significant product development operations internationally over the next several years we believe that our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize product development lower costs and integrate local market knowledge into our development activities we continually assess the significant costs and challenges including intellectual property protection against the benefits of our international development activities 

for further discussion regarding risks from our product development and introduction efforts see item 1a  “ risk factors ” 

marketing and sales 

we license or sell our products and services globally primarily through indirect channels consisting of distributors and resellers to a lesser extent we also transact directly with our enterprise and named account customers and with customers through our online autodesk branded store our indirect channel model includes both a twotiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a onetiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers we have a network of approximately 1600 resellers and distributors worldwide for fiscal 2018  approximately 70 of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers 

  

we anticipate that our channel mix will continue to change particularly as we scale our online autodesk branded store business and our largest accounts shift towards directonly business models importantly we expect our indirect channel will continue to transact and support the majority of our future revenue we employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our reseller channel with our business strategies our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller networks the loss of or a significant reduction in business with any one of our major distributors or large resellers could harm our business see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion 

sales through our largest distributor tech data corporation and its global affiliates accounted for 31  30  and 25 of our net revenue for fiscal years ended january 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively we believe our business is not substantially dependent on tech data our customers through tech data are the resellers and end users who purchase our software licenses and services should any of the agreements between us and tech data be terminated for any reason we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue no other distributor reseller or direct customer accounted for 10 or more of our revenue 

our customerrelated operations are divided into three geographic regions the americas europe middle east and africa “emea” and asia pacific “apac” each geographic region is supported by global marketing and sales organizations these organizations develop and manage overall marketing and sales programs and work closely with a network of domestic and international sales offices fiscal 2018 net revenue in the americas emea and apac was 8711 million  42  8154 million  40  and 3701 million  18  respectively we believe that international sales will continue to comprise the majority of our total net revenue adverse economic conditions and currency exchange rates in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue including emerging economies may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance a summary of our financial information by geographic location is found in note 13  “ segment geographic and product family information ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements our international operations and sales subject us to a variety of risks see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion

competition 

the markets for our products are highly competitive are subject to rapid change and can have complex interdependencies between many of the larger businesses we strive to increase our competitive separation by investing in research and development allowing us to bring new products to market and create exciting new versions of existing products that offer compelling efficiencies for our customers we also compete through investments in marketing and sales to more effectively reach new customers and better serve existing customers

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing power with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the industry is presently undergoing a platform shift from the personal computer to cloud and mobile computing this shift further lowers barriers to entry and poses a disruptive challenge to established software companies the design software market is characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete both from existing competitors and by entry of new competitors with innovative technologies competition is increasingly enhanced by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies and the possibility that competitors in one vertical segment may enter other vertical segments that we serve in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources than we do because of these and other factors competitive conditions in these industries are likely to continue to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which could harm our business see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion of risks regarding competition 

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to better serve customers by offering new products including cloud and mobile computing products whether by internal development or acquisition and to continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to ease of use reliability performance range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation price and training 

intellectual property and licenses 

we maintain an active program to legally protect our investment in technology through intellectual property rights we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions the nature and extent of legal protection associated with each such intellectual property right depends on among other things the type of intellectual property right and the given jurisdiction in which such right arises we believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business 

nonetheless our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws and enforcement of the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws enforcement of intellectual property rights against alleged infringers can sometimes lead to costly litigation and counterclaims our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business 

from time to time we receive claims alleging infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights including patents disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to among other things costly litigation or product shipment delays which could harm our business 

we retain ownership of software we develop our combined hybrid offerings include both desktop software and cloud functionality desktop software is licensed to users pursuant to ‘click through’ or signed license agreements containing restrictions on duplication disclosure and transfer cloud software and associated services are provided to users pursuant to online or signed terms of service agreements containing restrictions on access and use 

we believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our intellectual property and the rapid ongoing technological changes in both the computer hardware and software industries we must rely principally upon software engineering and marketing skills to continually maintain and enhance our competitive market position 

while we have recovered some revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the full extent to which piracy of our software products exists we believe however that software piracy is and can be expected to be a persistent problem that negatively impacts our revenue and financial results we believe that our transition from perpetual use software licenses to a subscriptionbased business model combined with the change from desktop to cloudbased computing will shift the incentives and means by which software is pirated

in addition through various licensing arrangements we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others we expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing arrangements in the future as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions to support continued development and sales of our products and services some of these licensing arrangements require or may require royalty payments and other licensing fees the amount of these payments and fees may depend on various factors including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments offsetting considerations if any and the degree of use of the licensed technology 

see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion of risks related to protecting our intellectual property 

production and suppliers 

the production of our software products and services involves duplication or hosting of software media the way that we deliver software has evolved during our business model transition for certain cloudbased products we use a combination of colocated hosting facilities and increasingly amazon web services and to a lesser degree other infrastructureasaservice providers over 95 of our customers choose an electronic software download option for both initial product fulfillment and subsequent product updates customers who choose electronic fulfillment receive the latest version of the software from our vendor’s secure servers customers may also obtain our software through media such as dvds and usb flash drives available from multiple sources the purchase of media and the transfer of the software programs onto media for distribution to customers are performed by us and by licensed subcontractors packaging materials are produced to our specifications by outside sources production is performed in leased facilities operated by independent thirdparty contractors to date we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the production of our software and documentation 

employees 

as of january 31 2018  we employed approximately 8800 people none of our employees in the united states are represented by a labor union in certain foreign countries our employees are represented by work councils we have never experienced any work stoppages and believe our employee relations are good reliance upon employees in other countries entails various risks and changes in these foreign countries such as government instability or regulation unfavorable to foreignowned businesses which could negatively impact our business in the future 

acquisitions 

over the past three years we acquired new technology or supplemented our technology by purchasing businesses or technology related assets focused in specific markets or industries for the fiscal years ended january 31 2018  2017  and 2016  we acquired companies and technology related assets some of which were accounted for as business combinations the following were significant acquisitions for fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  



deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue 

our deferred revenue balance at january 31 2018 was 19551 million and primarily relates to subscription and maintenance agreements invoiced for which the revenue has not yet been recognized but will be recognized as revenue ratably over the life of the contracts the term of our subscription contracts is typically between one and three years 

we define unbilled deferred revenue as contractually stated or committed orders under multiyear billing plans for subscription services license and maintenance for which the associated deferred revenue has not been recognized and the customer has not been invoiced unbilled deferred revenue is not included on our condensed consolidated balance sheet until invoiced to the customer

we expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue and deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons including the specific timing duration and size of large customer subscription and support agreements varying billing cycles of such agreements the specific timing of customer renewals foreign currency fluctuations and the timing of when billed and unbilled deferred revenue are recognized as revenue

risk factors 

tableend   

we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks a number of which are beyond our control in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following discussion highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on our business financial condition and future results of operations if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted causing the trading price of our common stock to decline in addition these risks and uncertainties may impact the “forwardlooking” statements described elsewhere in this form 10k and in the documents incorporated herein by reference they could affect our actual results of operations causing them to differ materially from those expressed in “forwardlooking” statements 

global economic and political conditions may further impact our industries business and financial results 

our overall performance depends largely upon domestic and worldwide economic and political conditions the united states and other international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services restricted credit poor liquidity decreased government spending reduced corporate profitability volatility in credit equity and foreign exchange markets bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy these economic conditions can occur abruptly if economic growth in countries where we do business slows or if such countries experience further economic recessions customers may delay or reduce technology purchases our customers include government entities including the us federal government and if spending cuts impede the ability of governments to purchase our products and services our revenue could decline in addition a number of our customers rely directly and indirectly on government spending 

geopolitical trends toward nationalism and protectionism and the weakening or dissolution of international trade pacts may increase the cost of or otherwise interfere with conducting business these trends have increased levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and may increase the volatility of global financial markets the impact of such developments on the global economy remains uncertain political instability or adverse political developments in any of the countries in which we do business could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

a financial sector credit crisis could impair credit availability and the financial stability of our customers including our distribution partners and channels a disruption in the financial markets may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking partners on which we rely for operating cash management any of 

2018 form 10k 14 

table of contents 

these events could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we fail to successfully manage our business model transition to cloudbased products and more flexible product licenses our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

to address the industry transition from personal computer to cloud mobile and social computing we accelerated our move to the cloud and are offering more flexible product licenses to support our transition we discontinued selling new perpetual licenses of most individual software products effective february 1 2016 and discontinued selling new perpetual licenses of suites effective august 1 2016 on june 15 2017 we commenced a program to incentivize maintenance plan customers to move to subscription plan offerings through this program we offer discounts to those maintenance plan customers that move to subscription plan offerings while at the same time increasing maintenance plan pricing over time for customers that remain on maintenance 

as a result we expect to derive an increasing portion of our revenues in the future from subscriptions this subscription model prices and delivers our products in a way that differs from the historical perpetual pricing and delivery methods these changes reflect a significant shift from perpetual license sales and distribution of our software in favor of providing our customers the right to access certain of our software in a hosted environment or use downloaded software for a specified subscription period during the first three years of the transition revenue billings gross margin operating margin net income loss earnings loss per share deferred revenue and cash flow from operations have been impacted as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than upfront and as new offerings bring a wider variety of price points 

our ability to achieve our financial objectives is subject to risks and uncertainties the new offerings require a considerable investment of technical financial legal and sales resources and a scalable organization market acceptance of such offerings is affected by a variety of factors including but not limited to security reliability performance current license terms customer preference socialcommunity engagement customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage their data public concerns regarding privacy and the enactment of restrictive laws or regulations whether our business model transition will prove successful and will accomplish our business and financial objectives is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including but not limited to customer demand attach and renewal rates channel acceptance our ability to further develop and scale infrastructure our ability to include functionality and usability in such offerings that address customer requirements tax and accounting implications pricing and our costs in addition the metrics we use to gauge the status of our business model transition may evolve over the course of the transition as significant trends emerge if we are unable to successfully establish these new offerings and navigate our business model transition in light of the foregoing risks and uncertainties our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

our strategy to develop and introduce new products and services exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance costs related to product defects and large expenditures each of which may not result in additional net revenue or could result in decreased net revenue 

rapid technological changes as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences characterize the software industry just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry 30 years ago we believe our industry is undergoing a similar transition from the personal computer to cloud mobile and social computing customers are also reconsidering the manner in which they license software products which requires us to constantly evaluate our business model and strategy in response we are focused on providing solutions to enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative on their projects we devote significant resources to the development of new technologies in addition we frequently introduce new business models or methods that require a considerable investment of technical and financial resources such as our introduction of flexible license and service offerings it is uncertain whether these strategies will prove successful or whether we will be able to develop the necessary infrastructure and business models more quickly than our competitors we are making such investments through further development and enhancement of our existing products and services as well as through acquisitions of new product lines such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs and could result in decreased net revenue if we are not able to meet customer requirements either with respect to our software or hardware products or the manner in which we provide such products or if we are not able to adapt our business model to meet our customers requirements our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted 

in particular a critical component of our growth strategy is to have customers of our autocad and autocad lt products expand their portfolios to include our other offerings and cloudbased services we want customers using individual autodesk products to expand their portfolio with our other offerings and cloudbased services and we are taking steps to accelerate this migration at times sales of licenses of our autocad and autocad lt or individual autodesk flagship products have decreased without a corresponding increase in industry collections or cloudbased 

2018 form 10k 15 

table of contents 

services revenue or without purchases of customer seats to our industry collections should this continue our results of operations will be adversely affected also adoption of our cloud and mobile computing offerings and changes in the delivery of our software and services to our customers such as product subscription offerings will change the way in which we recognize revenue relating to our software and services with a potential negative impact on our financial performance the accounting impact of these offerings and other business decisions are expected to result in an increase in the percentage of our ratable revenue as well as recurring revenue making for a more predictable business over time while potentially reducing our upfront perpetual revenue stream 

our executive management team must act quickly continuously and with vision given the rapidly changing customer expectations and technology advancements inherent in the software industry the extensive and complex efforts required to create useful and widely accepted products and the rapid evolution of cloud computing mobile devices new computing platforms and other technologies such as consumer products although we have articulated a strategy that we believe will fulfill these challenges if we fail to execute properly on that strategy or adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve we may fail to meet our customers expectations fail to compete with our competitors products and technology and lose the confidence of our channel partners and employees this in turn could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

a significant portion of our revenue is generated through maintenance revenue if decreases in maintenance revenue are not offset by increases in subscription revenue our future revenue and financial results will be negatively impacted 

our maintenance customers have no obligation to renew their maintenance contracts after the expiration of their maintenance period which is typically one year the discontinuance of our perpetual licenses for most individual software products on february 1 2016 and for perpetual suites on august 1 2016 resulted in the loss of future opportunities to sell maintenance on june 15 2017 we commenced a program to incentivize maintenance plan customers to move to subscription plan offerings as a result we expect customer renewal rates will decline or fluctuate over time as a result of a number of factors including the overall global economy the health of their businesses the perceived value of the maintenance program and planned maintenance pricing increases if our nonrenewing maintenance customers do not transition to subscriptions our future revenue and financial results will be negatively impacted 

we may not be able to predict subscription renewal rates and their impact on our future revenue and operating results 

our customers are not obligated to renew their subscriptions for our offerings and they may elect not to renew we cannot assure renewal rates or the mix of subscriptions renewals customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate due to a number of factors including offering pricing competitive offerings customer satisfaction and reductions in customer spending levels or customer activity due to economic downturns or financial markets uncertainty if our customers do not renew their subscriptions or if they renew on less favorable terms our revenues may decline 

revenue from our offerings may be difficult to predict during our business model transition 

the discontinuance of our perpetual licenses for most individual software products on february 1 2016 and for perpetual suites on august 1 2016 has and will continue to result in the loss of future upfront licensing revenue this also has frozen the growth of our maintenance revenue because there will be no further opportunities to attach maintenance licensing on june 15 2017 we commenced a program to incentivize maintenance plan customers to move to subscription plan offerings as a result we expect our maintenance revenue to decline over time but it may decline more quickly than anticipated due to low maintenance renewals at the same time our subscription revenue may not grow as rapidly as anticipated our subscription pricing allows customers to use our offerings at a lower initial cost when compared to the sale of a perpetual license although our subscriptions are designed to increase the number of customers who purchase offerings and create a recurring revenue stream that is more predictable over time it creates risks related to the timing of revenue recognition and expected reductions in cash flows in the near term 

actions that we are taking to restructure our business in alignment with our strategic priorities may not be as effective as anticipated 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we commenced a worldwide restructuring plan to support the companys strategic priorities of completing the subscription transition digitizing the company and reimagining manufacturing construction and production through the restructuring we seek to reduce our investment in areas not aligned with our strategic priorities including in areas related to research and development and gotomarket activities at the same time we plan to further invest in strategic priority areas related to as digital infrastructure customer success and construction

as a result of these actions we will incur additional costs in the short term that will have the effect of reducing our gaap operating margins we may encounter challenges in the execution of these efforts and these challenges could impact our financial results if we are unable to successfully complete our restructuring efforts our business and operating results may be harmed 

we are dependent on international revenue and operations exposing us to significant regulatory global economic intellectual property collections currency exchange rate taxation political instability and other risks which could adversely impact our financial results 

we are dependent on our international operations for a significant portion of our revenue international net revenue represented 64 and 63 of our net revenue in fiscal 2018 and 2017  respectively our international revenue including that from emerging economies is subject to general economic and political conditions in foreign markets including conditions in foreign markets resulting from economic and political conditions in the us our revenue is also impacted by the relative geographical and country mix of our revenue over time at times these factors adversely impact our international revenue and consequently our business as a whole our dependency on international revenue makes us much more exposed to global economic and political trends which can negatively impact our financial results even if our results in the us are strong for a particular period 

we anticipate that our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue and as we expand our international development sales and marketing expertise will provide significant support to our overall efforts in countries outside of the us

some of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above 

the brexit vote has exacerbated and may further exacerbate many of the risks and uncertainties described above the proposed withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union could among other potential outcomes adversely affect the tax tax treaty currency operational legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject the withdrawal could also among other potential outcomes disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and significantly disrupt trade between the united kingdom and the european union and other parties further uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the united kingdom and the other economies in which we operate 

even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls  

  

our offerings are subject to us export controls and economic sanctions laws and regulations that prohibit the shipment of certain products and services without the required export authorizations or export to locations governments and persons targeted by us sanctions while we have processes in place to prevent our offerings from being exported in violation of these laws including obtaining authorizations as appropriate and screening against us government and international lists of restricted and prohibited persons we cannot guarantee that these processes will prevent all violations of export control and sanctions laws 

  

we also note that if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import export or reexport licenses or permits we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm as well as other negative consequences including government investigations and penalties we presently incorporate export control and sanctions compliance requirements in our channel partner agreements complying with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities 

violations of us sanctions or export control laws can result in fines or penalties while we have extensive compliance procedures in place licensing of our product offerings may have been made in potential violation of the export control and economic sanctions laws we filed a voluntary self disclosure in december 2016 with the us treasury department’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” with respect to the sale of certain licenses in an aggregate amount of less than 700000 we are currently waiting for ofac to complete its review of this matter we could be subject to monetary penalties or other sanctions by ofac in connection with its review of this issue 

our software is highly complex and may contain undetected errors defects or vulnerabilities each of which could harm our business and financial performance 

the software products that we offer are complex and despite extensive testing and quality control may contain errors defects or vulnerabilities some errors defects and vulnerabilities in our software products may only be discovered after the product or service has been released any errors defects or vulnerabilities could result in the need for corrective releases to our software products damage to our reputation loss of revenue an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products any of which would likely harm our business and financial performance 

existing and increased competition and rapidly evolving technological changes may reduce our revenue and profits 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing devices with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the industry is presently undergoing a platform shift from the personal computer to cloud and mobile computing this shift further lowers barriers

to entry and poses a disruptive challenge to established software companies the markets in which we compete are characterized by vigorous competition both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources furthermore a reduction in the number and availability of compatible thirdparty applications or our inability to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes including those related to cloud computing mobile devices and new computing platforms may adversely affect the sale of our products because of these and other factors competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which would likely harm our business 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the us we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change our exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 

we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our cash flow exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as part of our risk management strategy we use foreign currency contracts to manage a portion of our exposures of underlying assets liabilities and other obligations which exist as part of our ongoing business operations these foreign currency instruments have maturities that extend for one to twelve months in the future and provide us with some protection against currency exposures however our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be completely successful resulting in an adverse impact on our financial results 

the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period although our foreign currency cash flow hedge program extends beyond the current quarter in order to reduce our exposure to foreign currency volatility we do not attempt to completely mitigate this risk and in any case will incur transaction fees in adopting such hedging programs such volatility even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings 

security incidents may compromise the integrity of our or our customers’ products services data or intellectual property harm our reputation damage our competitiveness create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results 

as we digitize the company and use cloud and web base technologies to leverage customer data to deliver the total customer experience we are exposed to increased security risks and the potential for unauthorized access to or improper use of our and our customers information like all software products and systems ours are vulnerable to security incidents we devote resources to maintain the security and integrity of our systems products services and applications online mobile and desktop we accomplish this by enhancing security features conducting penetration tests code hardening releasing security vulnerability updates and accelerating our incident response time despite these efforts we may not prevent security incidents 

hackers regularly have targeted our systems products services and applications and we expect them to do so in the future the impact of security incidents could disrupt the proper functioning of our systems products or services cause errors in the output of our customers work allow unauthorized access to sensitive data or intellectual property including proprietary or confidential information of ours or our customers or other destructive outcomes 

the risk of a security incident particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyber terrorists has increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased these threats include but are not limited to identity theft unauthorized access dns attacks wireless network attacks viruses and worms advanced persistent threat apt application centric attacks peertopeer attacks phishing malicious file uploads backdoor trojans and distributed denial of service ddos attacks in addition third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees vendors partners or users to disclose information to gain access to our data or our users’ data and there is the risk of employee contractor or vendor error or malfeasance any of the foregoing could attack our systems products or services despite efforts to create security barriers to such programs it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk

if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation may suffer our competitive position may be diminished customers may stop buying our products and services we could face lawsuits and potential liability and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

increasing regulatory focus on privacy issues and expanding laws may impact our business or expose us to increased liability 

our strategy to digitize the company involves increasing our use of cloud and web based technologies and applications to leverage customer data to accomplish this strategy we must collect customer data which may include personal data federal state and foreign government privacy and data security laws apply to the treatment of personal data governments the plaintiffs’ bar privacy advocates and customers have increased their focus on how companies collect process use store share and transmit personal data 

the general data protection regulation gdpr will apply in all eu member states effective may 25 2018 and replace the current eu data protection directive the gdpr introduces new data protection requirements in the eu and substantial fines for noncompliance the gdpr increases our responsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data and we have and will continue to put in place additional processes and programs to demonstrate compliance compliance with these laws is costly and could delay or impede the development of new offerings any failure to comply with gdpr or other data privacy laws could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties further any perceived privacy right violation could cause result in reputational harm thirdparty claims lawsuits or investigations additionally we store customer information and content and if our customers fail to comply with contractual obligations or applicable laws it could result in litigation or reputational harm to us 

gdpr other new laws and selfregulatory codes may affect our ability to reach current and prospective customers to understand how our products and services are being used to respond to customer requests allowed under the laws and to implement our new business models effectively these new laws and regulations would similarly affect our competitors as well as our customers these requirements could impact demand for our products and services and result in more onerous contract obligations 

we rely on thirdparties to provide us with a number of operational and technical services thirdparty security incidents could expose us to liability harm our reputation damage our competitiveness and adversely impact our financial performance

if we do not maintain good relationships with the members of our distribution channel our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected if our distribution channel suffers financial losses becomes financially unstable or insolvent or is not provided the right mix of incentives to sell our products our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected 

we sell our software products both directly to endusers and through a network of distributors and resellers for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017  approximately 70 and 72  respectively of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the future our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller network computer software distributors and resellers typically are not highly capitalized have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and experienced difficulties during the past several years we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of distributors and resellers prior to our sales to them in the past we have taken steps to support them and may take additional steps in the future such as extending credit terms and providing temporary discounts these steps if taken could harm our financial results if our distributors and resellers were to become insolvent they would not be able to maintain their business and sales or provide customer support services which would negatively impact our business and revenue 

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including the distributor tech data tech data accounted for 31 and 30 of our total net revenue for fiscal 2018 and 2017  respectively although we believe that we are not substantially dependent on tech data if tech data were to experience a significant disruption with its business or if our relationship with tech data were to significantly deteriorate it is possible that our ability to sell to end users would be at least temporarily negatively impacted this could in turn negatively impact our financial results 

over time we have modified and will continue to modify aspects of our relationship with our distributors and resellers such as their incentive programs pricing to them and our distribution model to motivate and reward them for aligning their businesses with our strategy and business objectives changes in these relationships and underlying programs could negatively impact their business and harm our business further our distributors and resellers may lose confidence in our business model transition move to competitive products or may not have the skills or ability to support customers under the new model the loss of or a significant reduction in business with those distributors or resellerscould harm our business in particular if one or more of such distributors or resellers were unable to meet their obligations with respect to accounts payable to us we could be forced to write off such accounts and may be required to delay the recognition of revenue on future sales to these customers these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

our financial results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenue and financial results difficult to predict 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so in the future these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines we also provide investors with quarterly and annual financial forwardlooking guidance that could prove to be inaccurate as a result of these fluctuations in addition to the other factors described in this part i item 1a some of the factors that could cause our financial results to fluctuate include

we have also experienced fluctuations in financial results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic or political conditions in particular our financial results in europe during our third quarter are usually affected by a slower summer period and our apac operations typically experience seasonal slowing in our third and fourth quarters 

our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenue and are relatively fixed in the short term accordingly any revenue shortfall below expectations has had and in the future could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability greater than anticipated expenses or a failure to maintain rigorous cost controls would also negatively affect profitability 

our business could suffer as a result of risks costs charges and integration risks associated with strategic acquisitions and investments 

we regularly acquire or invest in businesses software products and technologies that are complementary to our business through acquisitions strategic alliances or equity or debt investments the risks associated with such acquisitions include among others the difficulty of assimilating products operations and personnel inheriting liabilities such as intellectual property infringement claims the failure to realize anticipated revenue and cost projections the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business in accordance with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the diversion of managements time and attention 

in addition such acquisitions and investments involve other risks such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may not be successful in overcoming such risks and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business in addition such acquisitions and investments have in the past and may in the future contribute to potential fluctuations in our quarterly financial results these fluctuations could arise from transactionrelated costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or writeoffs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments these costs or charges could negatively impact our financial results for a given period cause quarter to quarter variability in our financial results or negatively impact our financial results for several future periods

because we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from a small number of products including our autocadbased software products and collections if these products are not successful our revenue will be adversely affected 

we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from sales of licenses of a limited number of our products including autocad software products based on autocad which include our collections that serve specific markets and products that are interoperable with autocad any factor adversely affecting sales of these products including the product release cycle market acceptance product competition performance and reliability reputation price competition economic and market conditions and the availability of thirdparty applications would likely harm our financial results during fiscal 2018 and 2017  combined revenue from our autocad and autocad lt products not including collections formerly suites having autocad or autocad lt as a component represented 20 and 16 of our total net revenue respectively 

we are investing in resources to update and improve our information technology systems to digitize the company and support our business model transition should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems disrupt our operations our business model transition could be compromised and our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network and data center infrastructure technology systems and our websites for our development marketing operational support sales accounting and financial reporting activities we continually invest resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet the growing and evolving requirements of our business and customers in particular our transition to cloudbased products and a subscriptiononly business model requires considerable investment in the development of technologies as well as back office systems for technical financial compliance and sales resources to enable a scalable organization 

such improvements are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or uncover problems with our existing technology systems unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in disruption in our business operations loss of customers loss of revenue errors in our accounting and financial reporting or damage to our reputation all of which could compromise our business model transition 

if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights our business could be harmed 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright and trademark laws trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software products or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our software products is timeconsuming and costly we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists and we expect that software piracy will remain a persistent problem particularly in emerging economies furthermore our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 

additionally we actively protect the secrecy of our confidential information and trade secrets including our source code if unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code the loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for thirdparties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our financial performance and our reputation we also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of nondisclosure agreements with our customers contractors vendors and partners however it is possible that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization if this were to occur it may be difficult andor costly for us to enforce our rights and our financial performance and reputation could be negatively impacted 

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in the loss of significant rights 

as more software patents are granted worldwide the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims infringement or misappropriation claims have in the past been and may in the future be asserted against us and any such assertions could harm our business additionally certain patent holders without products have become more aggressive in threatening and pursuing litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents any such claims or threats whether with or without merit have been and could in the future be timeconsuming to defend result in costly litigation and diversion of resources cause product shipment

delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in addition such royalty or license agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms if at all which would likely harm our business 

from time to time we realign or introduce new business and sales initiatives if we fail to successfully execute and manage these initiatives our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

as part of our effort to accommodate our customers needs and demands and the rapid evolution of technology we from time to time evolve our business and sales initiatives such as realigning our development and marketing organizations offering software as a service and realigning our internal resources in an effort to improve efficiency we may take such actions without clear indications that they will prove successful and at times we have been met with shortterm challenges in the execution of such initiatives market acceptance of any new business or sales initiative is dependent on our ability to match our customers needs at the right time and price often we have limited prior experience and operating history in these new areas of emphasis if any of our assumptions about expenses revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated and our financial results will be negatively impacted 

net revenue billings earnings or subscriptions shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline 

the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including the other factors described in this part i  item 1a and the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant changes in the price of our common stock could expose us to costly and timeconsuming litigation historically after periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities a company becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts managements attention and resources 

our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our success and ability to invest and grow depend largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical professional managerial sales and marketing personnel historically competition for these key personnel has been intense the loss of services of any of our key personnel including key personnel joining our company through acquisitions the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel

particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions and financial goals 

our investment portfolio consists of a variety of investment vehicles in a number of countries that are subject to interest rate trends market volatility and other economic factors if general economic conditions decline this could cause the credit ratings of our investments to deteriorate illiquidity in the financial marketplace and we may experience a decline in interest income and an inability to sell our investments leading to impairment in the value of our investments 

it is our policy to invest our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in highly liquid instruments with and in the custody of financial institutions with high credit ratings and to limit the amounts invested with any one institution type of security and issuer however we are subject to general economic conditions interest rate trends and volatility in the financial marketplace that can affect the income that we receive from our investments the net realizable value of our investments including our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and our ability to sell them any one of these factors could reduce our investment income or result in material charges which in turn could impact our overall net income loss and earnings loss per share 

from time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies privately held company investments are considered inherently risky the technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies 

a loss on any of our investments may cause us to record an otherthantemporary impairment charge the effect of this charge could impact our overall net income loss and earnings loss per share in any of these scenarios our liquidity may be negatively impacted which in turn may prohibit us from making investments in our business taking advantage of opportunities and potentially meeting our financial obligations as they come due 

we are subject to legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries and we may be named in additional legal proceedings or become involved in regulatory inquiries in the future all of which are costly distracting to our core business and could result in an unfavorable outcome or a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or the trading prices for our securities 

we are involved in legal proceedings and receive inquiries from regulatory agencies as the global economy has changed and our business has evolved we have seen an increase in litigation activity and regulatory inquiries like many other high technology companies the number and frequency of inquiries from us and foreign regulatory agencies we have received regarding our business and our business practices and the business practices of others in our industry have increased in recent years in the event that we are involved in significant disputes or are the subject of a formal action by a regulatory agency we could be exposed to costly and time consuming legal proceedings that could result in any number of outcomes any claims or regulatory actions initiated by or against us whether successful or not could result in expensive costs of defense costly damage awards injunctive relief increased costs of business fines or orders to change certain business practices significant dedication of management time diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business in any of these cases our financial results results of operations cash flows or the trading prices for our securities could be negatively impacted 

we are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions our effective tax rate is primarily based on our expected geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany arrangements including the manner in which we develop value and license our intellectual property and enacted tax rules significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis while we believe our tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 

tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied for example the us government enacted significant tax law changes in december 2017 commonly referred to as the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which will impact our tax obligations and effective tax rate beginning in our fiscal 2018 tax year increasingly governmental tax authorities are scrutinizing corporate tax strategies many 

2018 form 10k 26 

table of contents 

countries in the european union as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that if enacted could increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business if us or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge the manner in which our profits are currently recognized our overall taxes could increase and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted 

  

uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the tax act could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate 

the tax act was enacted on december 22 2017 and provides broad and significant changes to the us tax code and how the us imposes income tax on multinational corporations due to the complexity and varying interpretations of the tax act the us department of treasury and other standardsetting bodies may issue regulations and interpretative guidance that could significantly impact how we will apply the law and the ultimate impact to our results of operations from the tax act 

the tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously provided for in the us tax law these computations require significant judgments to be made regarding the interpretation of the provisions within the tax act along with preparation and analysis of information not previously required in conjunction with the tax act the sec issued staff accounting bulletin 118 “sab 118” which allows for the company to record provisional amounts until a final assessment can be made within a period not to exceed one year from the date of enactment as a result we have recorded a provisional estimate on the effect of the tax act in our financial statements based on our initial assessment as additional regulatory guidance is issued and we continue to collect and analyze necessary data we may make adjustments to provisional amounts previously recorded we do not anticipate these adjustments to materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made since we are in a full valuation allowance in the us 

changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business further such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective 

for example in may 2014 fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap this standard establishes a principle for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services the standard also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining and fulfilling customer contracts in august 2015 fasb subsequently issued asu 201514 which deferred the effectiveness of asu 201409 so that it will now be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 including interim periods within that reporting period the revised effective date for the company under the new standard will be the beginning of fiscal 2019 we are implementing changes to our policies procedures and systems in order to successfully adopt the standard this new standard is both technical and complex and we expect to incur significant ongoing costs to implement and maintain compliance with this new standard in addition there may be greater uncertainty with respect to projecting revenue results from future operations as we work through the new revenue recognition standard 

adoption of asu 201409 along with any other changes in accounting principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change any difficulties in the implementation of new or changed accounting standards including asu 201409 could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations if our estimates relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions or judgments that change or prove to be incorrect our operating results could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price in addition as we evolve and change our business and sales models we are currently unable to determine how these potential changes may impact our new models particularly in the area of revenue recognition

we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting the report contains among other matters an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 

if our management or independent registered public accounting firm identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we would be unable to assert that such internal control over financial reporting is effective if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion that our internal controls are effective we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which could have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 

in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements which if not accurate may significantly impact our financial results 

we make assumptions judgments and estimates for a number of items including the fair value of financial instruments goodwill longlived assets and other intangible assets the realizability of deferred tax assets and the fair value of stock awards we also make assumptions judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee related liabilities including commissions bonuses and sabbaticals and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions partner incentive programs product returns reserves allowances for doubtful accounts asset retirement obligations and legal contingencies these assumptions judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from our estimates and such differences could significantly impact our financial results 

we rely on third party technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies our product and service development may be delayed and our financial results negatively impacted 

we rely on certain software that we license from third parties including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions these thirdparty software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and the software may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software can be developed identified licensed and integrated which would likely harm our business 

disruptions with licensing relationships and third party developers could adversely impact our business 

we license certain key technologies from third parties licenses may be restricted in the term or the use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business similarly we may not be able to obtain or renew license agreements for key technology on favorable terms if at all and any failure to do so could harm our business 

our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with thirdparty developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn in particular markets such disruptions have in the past and would likely in the future negatively impact these thirdparty developers and end users which could harm our business 

additionally technology created by outsourced product development whether outsourced to third parties or developed externally and transferred to us through business or technology acquisitions has certain additional risks such as effective integration into existing products adequate transfer of technology knowhow and ownership and protection of transferred intellectual property

as a result of our strategy of partnering with other companies for product development our product delivery schedules could be adversely affected if we experience difficulties with our product development partners 

we partner with certain independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities we believe our partnering strategy allows us to among other things achieve efficiencies in developing new products and maintaining and enhancing existing product offerings our partnering strategy creates a dependency on such independent developers independent developers including those who currently develop products for us in the us and throughout the world may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future in addition use of development resources through consulting relationships particularly in nonus jurisdictions with developing legal systems may be adversely impacted by and expose us to risks relating to evolving employment export and intellectual property laws these risks could among other things expose our intellectual property to misappropriation and result in disruptions to product delivery schedules 

our business may be significantly disrupted upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event 

our business is highly automated and relies extensively on the availability of our network and data center infrastructure our internal technology systems and our websites we also rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide to our customers and computer operations for our internal use the failure of our systems or hosted computer services due to a catastrophic event such as an earthquake fire flood tsunami weather event telecommunications failure power failure cyber attack terrorism or war could adversely impact our business financial results and financial condition we have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems in order to reduce the potential impact of a catastrophic event however there can be no assurance that these plans and systems would enable us to return to normal business operations in addition any such event could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products this could in turn decrease that countrys or regions demand for our products thereby negatively impacting our financial results 

if we were required to record an impairment charge related to the value of our longlived assets or an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets our results of operations would be adversely affected 

our longlived assets are tested for impairment if indicators of impairment exist if impairment testing shows that the carrying value of our longlived assets exceeds their estimated fair values we would be required to record a noncash impairment charge which would decrease the carrying value of our longlived assets as the case may be and our results of operations would be adversely affected our deferred tax assets include net operating loss amortizable tax assets and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods each quarter we assess the need for a valuation allowance considering both positive and negative evidence to determine whether all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in fiscal 2016 we determined that it was more likely than not that the company would not realize our us deferred tax assets and established a valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets we continued to have a full valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets in fiscal 2018  changes in the amount of the valuation allowance could result in a material noncash expense or benefit in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted and our results of operations could be materially affected we will continue to perform these tests and any future adjustments may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we issued  16 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes in debt offerings and have an existing  4000 million revolving credit facility and expect to incur other debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

in june 2017 we issued  5000 million aggregate principal amount of 35 notes due june 15 2027  in june 2015 we issued 3125 notes due june 15 2020 in an aggregate principal amount of  4500 million and 4375 notes due june 15 2025 in an aggregate principal amount of  3000 million  in december 2012 we issued 36 notes due december 15 2022 in an aggregate principal amount of  3500 million  as the debt matures we will have to expend significant resources to either repay or refinance these notes for example in july 2017 we redeemed outstanding senior notes due december 15 2017  for a total cash repayment of 4018 million by using the proceeds from the notes we issued in 2017 if we decide to refinance notes in the future we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all both of which may adversely affect our financial condition 

we also have a  4000 million revolving credit facility as of january 31 2018  we had no outstanding borrowings on the line of credit although we have no current plans to borrow under this credit facility we may use the proceeds of any future borrowing for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business our existing

this credit agreement contains customary covenants that could restrict the imposition of liens on autodesk’s assets and restrict the company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness or make dispositions of assets if autodesk fails to maintain the financial covenants the financial covenants consist of a maximum debt to total cash ratio a fixed charge coverage ratio through april 30 2018 and after april 30 2018 a minimum interest coverage ratio 

we are required to comply with the covenants set forth in our unsecured notes and revolving credit facility our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or lenders then subject to applicable cure periods we would not be able to incur additional indebtedness under the credit facility and any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities under certain circumstances if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility could increase downgrades in our credit ratings could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing

strategy 

autodesk makes software for people who make things if you have ever driven a highperformance car admired a towering skyscraper used a smartphone or watched a great film chances are you have experienced what millions of autodesk customers are doing with our software autodesk gives you the power to make anything 

autodesk was founded during the platform transition from mainframe computers and engineering workstations to personal computers we developed and sustained a compelling value proposition based upon desktop software for the personal computer just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry over 30 years ago we believe our industry is undergoing a similar transition from the personal computer to cloud mobile and social computing to address this transition we have accelerated our move to the cloud and mobile devices and are offering more flexible licensing our product subscriptions currently represent a hybrid of desktop software and cloud functionality which provides a deviceindependent collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders our saas offerings for example bim 360 shotgun fusion and autocad 360 pro provide tools including mobile and social capabilities to streamline design collaboration building and manufacturing and data management processes we believe that customer adoption of these new offerings will continue to grow as customers across a range of industries begin to take advantage of the scalable computing power and flexibility provided through these new services 

our strategy is to lead the industries we serve to cloudbased technologies and business models this entails both a technological shift and a business model shift as part of the transition we discontinued selling new perpetual licenses of most individual software products effective february 1 2016 and discontinued selling new perpetual licenses of suites while introducing industry collections effective august 1 2016 industry collections provide our customers with increased access to a broader selection of autodesk products and services that exceeds those previously available in suites  simplifying the customer ability to get access to a complete set of tools for their industry we now offer subscriptions for individual products and industry collections cloud service offerings and flexible enterprise business agreements collectively referred to as subscription plan these subscription plan offerings are designed to give our customers more flexibility with how they use our products and service offerings and to attract a broader range of customers such as projectbased users and small businesses

with the discontinuation of the sale of most perpetual licenses we have transitioned away from selling a mix of perpetual licenses and termbased product subscriptions toward a single subscription model on june 15 2017 we commenced a program to incentivize maintenance plan customers to move to subscription plan offerings through this program we offer discounts to those maintenance customers that move to a subscription plan while at the same time increasing maintenance plan pricing over time for customers that remain on maintenance 

to provide more meaningful information as to the performance of different categories of product and services we have changed our presentation of revenue and cost of revenue on our condensed consolidated statements of operations effective the first quarter of fiscal 2018 see note 1  business and summary of significant accounting policies  for additional information 

during the first three years of the transition revenue margins eps deferred revenue and cash flow from operations have been impacted as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than upfront and as subscription plan offerings generally have a lower initial purchase price 

as we progress through the current stage of the business model transition annualized recurring revenue arr growth of billings and total subscriptions better reflect business momentum to further analyze progress we disaggregate our growth between the original maintenance model maintenance plan and the subscription plan model maintenance plan subscriptions peaked in the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2016 as we discontinued selling new maintenance plan subscriptions in fiscal 2017 and we expect them to decline slowly over time as maintenance plan customers continue to convert to our subscription plans 

in order to support our strategic priorities of completing the subscription transition digitizing the company and reimagining manufacturing construction and production we commenced a worldwide restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 through the restructuring we seek to reduce our investments in areas not aligned with our strategic priorities including in areas related to research and development and gotomarket activities at the same time we plan to further invest in strategic priority areas related to digital infrastructure customer success and construction by rebalancing resources to better align with our strategic priorities we are positioning ourselves to meet our longterm goals while keeping nongaap spend flat in fiscal 2019 we anticipate incurring pretax restructuring charges of 135 million to 149 million substantially all of which would result in cash expenditures 124 million to 137 million of which would be for onetime employee termination benefits and 11 million to 12 million of which would be for facilitiesrelated and other costs if we are unable to successfully complete our reorganizational efforts we may need to undertake additional restructuring efforts and our business and operating results may be harmed

we sell our products and services globally through a combination of indirect and direct channels our indirect channels include value added resellers direct market resellers distributors computer manufacturers and other software developers our direct channels include internal sales resources dedicated to selling in our largest accounts our highly specialized products and business transacted through our online autodesk branded store the following chart shows our split between indirect and direct 

channels for the fiscal years ended january 31 2018 2017 and 2016 

we anticipate that our channel mix will continue to change as we scale our online autodesk branded store business and our largest accounts shift towards directonly business models however we expect our indirect channel will continue to transact and support the majority of our customers and revenue as we move beyond the business model transition we employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our direct and indirect channels with our business strategies in addition we have a worldwide user group organization and we have created online user communities dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products 

one of our key strategies is to maintain an openarchitecture design of our software products to facilitate thirdparty development of complementary products and industryspecific software solutions this approach enables customers and third parties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses we offer several programs that provide strategic investment funding technological platforms user communities technical support forums and events to developers who develop addon applications for our products for example we have established the autodesk forge program to support innovators that build solutions to facilitate the development of a single connected ecosystem for the future of how things are designed made and used as well as support ideas that push the boundaries of 3d printing 

in addition to the competitive advantages afforded by our technology our large global network of distributors resellers thirdparty developers customers educational institutions educators and students is a key competitive advantage which has been cultivated over an extensive period of time this network of partners and relationships provides us with a broad and deep reach into volume markets around the world our distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with the resources to purchase deploy learn and support our products quickly and easily we have a significant number of registered thirdparty developers who create products that work well with our products and extend them for a variety of specialized applications 

autodesk is committed to helping fuel a lifelong passion for design in students of all ages we offer free educational licenses of autodesk software worldwide to students educators and accredited educational institutions we inspire and support beginners with tinkercad a simple online 3d design and 3d printing tool through autodesk design academy we provide

secondary and postsecondary school markets hundreds of standardsaligned class projects to support designbased disciplines in science technology engineering digital arts and math steam while using autodesks professionalgrade 3d design engineering and entertainment software used in industry we also have made autodesk design academy curricula available on itunes u and udemy our intention is to make autodesk software ubiquitous and the design and making software of choice for those poised to become the next generation of professional users 

our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products technology and businesses acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers however they entail cost and integration challenges and may in certain instances negatively impact our operating margins we continually review these tradeoffs in making decisions regarding acquisitions we currently anticipate that we will continue to acquire products technology and businesses as compelling opportunities become available 

our strategy depends upon a number of assumptions to successfully make the transition toward new cloud and mobile platforms including the related technology and business model shifts making our technology available to mainstream markets leveraging our large global network of distributors resellers thirdparty developers customers educational institutions and students improving the performance and functionality of our products and adequately protecting our intellectual property if the outcome of any of these assumptions differs from our expectations we may not be able to implement our strategy which could potentially adversely affect our business for further discussion regarding these and related risks see part i  item 1a  “ risk factors ” 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we regularly reevaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we believe that of all our significant accounting policies the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 

for multiple element arrangements containing only software and softwarerelated elements we allocate the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on our vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value vsoe is the price charged when an element is sold separately or a price set by management with the relevant authority if we do not have vsoe of an undelivered software license we defer revenue recognition on the entire sales arrangement until all elements for which we do not have vsoe are delivered if we do not have vsoe for undelivered product subscriptions maintenance or services the revenue for the arrangement is recognized over the longest contractual service period in the arrangement we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 

for multiple elements arrangements involving nonsoftware elements including cloud subscription services our revenue recognition policy is based upon the accounting guidance contained in accounting standards codification asc 605 revenue recognition  for these arrangements we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the nonsoftware elements we then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group using the residual method as described above we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of revenue to be recognized in each accounting period 

we allocate the total arrangement consideration among the various elements based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on its vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or the best estimated selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available besp represents the price at which autodesk would transact for the deliverable if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis to establish besp for those elements for which 

2018 form 10k 38 

table of contents 

neither vsoe nor tpe are available we perform a quantitative analysis of pricing data points for historical standalone transactions involving such elements for a twelvemonth period as part of this analysis we monitor and evaluate the besp against actual pricing to ensure that it continues to represent a reasonable estimate of the standalone selling price considering several other external and internal factors including but not limited to pricing and discounting practices contractually stated prices the geographies in which we offer our products and services and the type of customer ie distributor valueadded reseller and direct end user among others we analyze besp at least annually or on a more frequent basis if a significant change in our business necessitates a more timely analysis or if we experience significant variances in our selling prices 

in situations when we have multiple contracts with a single counterparty we use the guidance in asc 985605 to evaluate both the form and the substance of the arrangements to determine if they should be combined and accounted for as one arrangement or as separate arrangements 

our assessment of the likelihood of collection is also a critical factor in determining the timing of revenue recognition if we do not believe that collection is probable the revenue will be deferred until payment is received 

our indirect channel model includes both a twotiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a onetiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers our subscription revenue from distributors and resellers generally commences recognition at the time access is provided to their customers provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met this policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns among other criteria we are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

as part of the indirect channel model we have a partner incentive program that uses quarterly attainment of monetary rewards to motivate distributors and resellers to achieve mutually agreed upon business goals in a specified time period a portion of these incentives reduce license and other revenue in the current period the remainder which relates to incentives on our subscription program is recorded as a reduction to deferred revenue in the period the subscription transaction is billed and subsequently recognized as a reduction to subscription revenue over the contract period these incentive balances do not require significant assumptions or judgments depending on how the payments are made the reserves associated with the partner incentive program are treated on the balance sheet as either contra account receivable or accounts payable 

marketable securities and privately held company investments as described in note 2  “ financial instruments ” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements our investments in marketable securities are measured at the end of each reporting period and reported at fair value fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date in determining the fair value of our investments we are sometimes required to use various alternative valuation techniques inputs to valuation techniques are either observable or unobservable observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions these two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy 

 

 

 

this hierarchy requires us to minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to use observable market data if available when determining fair value this is generally true for our cash and cash equivalents and the majority of our marketable securities which we consider to be level 1 assets and level 2 assets however determining the fair value of marketable securities or convertible note investments in privately held companies when observable inputs are not available level 3 requires significant judgment for example we use probability weighted discounted cash flow models in which some of the inputs are unobservable in the market to estimate the fair value of our convertible debt securities these assumptions are inherently subjective and involve significant management judgment whenever possible we use observable market data and rely on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available when determining fair value 

2018 form 10k 39 

table of contents 

all of autodesk’s marketable securities and privately held company investments are subject to a periodic impairment review we recognize an impairment charge when a decline in the fair value of its investments below the cost basis is judged to be otherthantemporary autodesk considers various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than autodesk’s cost basis the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the investee and autodesk’s intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value 

business combinations   we allocate the fair value of the consideration transferred to the assets and liabilities acquired as well as to inprocess research and development based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the purchase price allocation requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations 

although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain examples of critical estimates used in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to 

 

 

 

 

these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and if such events occur we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities 

realizability of longlived assets we assess the realizability of our longlived assets and related intangible assets other than goodwill quarterly or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review significant underperformance of a business or product line relative to budget shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends and the results of past impairment reviews when such events or changes in circumstances occur we assess recoverability of these assets 

we assess recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows we would perform a discounted cash flow analysis to assess impairments on longlived assets variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge impairment charges if any result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values 

in addition to our recoverability assessments we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our longlived assets any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made as well as in subsequent quarters 

we will continue to evaluate the values of our longlived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability approach under this method deferred tax assets including those related to tax loss carryforwards and credits and deferred tax liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we recognize the tax benefit for an uncertain tax position when it meets a more 

2018 form 10k 40 

table of contents 

likely than not threshold we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense 

a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be recovered the valuation allowance is determined by assessing both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable such assessment is required on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis significant judgment is required in determining whether the valuation allowance should be recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we considered cumulative losses in the us arising from the company’s business model transition as a significant source of negative evidence considering this negative evidence and the absence of sufficient positive objective evidence that we would generate sufficient taxable income in the us to realize the deferred tax assets we determined that it was more likely than not that the company would not realize us federal and state deferred tax assets and recorded a valuation allowance on our federal and state deferred tax assets we continue to have a full valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets in fiscal 2018  

as we continually strive to optimize our overall business model tax planning strategies may become feasible and prudent whereby management may determine that it is more likely than not that the federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized therefore we will continue to evaluate the evidence around our ability to utilize our net deferred tax assets each quarter both in the us and in foreign jurisdictions based on all available evidence both positive and negative 

stockbased compensation  we measure stockbased compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award and recognize expense ratably over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period we estimate the fair value of certain stockbased payment awards including grants of employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan using either the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model or a binomiallattice model eg monte carlo simulation model to determine the grantdate fair value of our stockbased payment awards we use a blackscholes model or the quoted stock price on the date of grant unless the awards are subject to market conditions in which case we use the monte carlo simulation model the monte carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables to estimate the probability that market conditions will be achieved these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors the riskfree interest rate for the expected term of the award and expected dividends the variables used in these models are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted as needed sharebased compensation cost for restricted stock is measured on the closing fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

legal contingencies  as described in part i  item 3  “ legal proceedings ” and part ii  item 8  note 8  “ commitments and contingencies ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations 

restructuring charges and other facility exit costs net and accruals  the company’s restructuring plans include one–time termination benefits as well as certain contractual termination benefits we record costs associated with exit activities related to restructuring plans in accordance with the asc topic 420 exit or disposal obligations  liabilities for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred the timing of associated cash payments is dependent upon the type of exit cost and may extend over a 12month period or longer we record restructuring charge liabilities in “other accrued liabilities” or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 

restructuring charges include employee termination costs facility closure accelerated depreciation of certain assets and relocation costs and contract termination costs one–time termination benefits are recognized as a liability at estimated fair value when the approved plan of termination has been communicated to employees unless employees must provide future service that is longer than the statutory requirement in which case the benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period for the facilityrelated restructuring charges we recognize upon exiting all or a portion of a leased facility and meeting ceaseuse and other requirements the amount of restructuring charges is based on the fair value of the lease obligation for the abandoned space which includes a sublease assumption that could be reasonably obtained we also recognize accelerated depreciation related to assets at the time we commit to a plan to abandon

restructuring charges require significant estimates and assumptions including sublease income and expenses for severance and other employee separation costs our estimates involve a number of risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control including future real estate market conditions and our ability to successfully enter into subleases or termination agreements with terms as favorable as those assumed when arriving at our estimates we monitor these estimates and assumptions on at least a quarterly basis for changes in circumstances and any corresponding adjustments to the accrual are recorded in our statement of operations in the period when such changes are known

overview of fiscal 2018 

 

we are undergoing a business model transition in which we have discontinued selling new perpetual licenses for most of our products in favor of subscriptions during the first three years of the transition revenue margins eps deferred revenue and cash flow from operations were impacted as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than upfront and as product subscription plan offerings generally have a lower initial purchase price 

  

revenue analysis 

during fiscal 2018  net revenue increased 1  as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to a 102 increase in subscription revenue the increase in subscription revenue was partially offset by a 64 decrease in license and other revenue 

further discussion of the drivers of these results are described below under the heading “results from operations” 

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including tech data corporation and its global affiliates collectively “tech data” total sales to tech data accounted for 31  30  and 25 of our consolidated net revenue during fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively our customers through tech data are the resellers and end users who purchase our software licenses and services should any of the agreements with tech data be terminated for any reason we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue consequently we believe our business is not substantially dependent on tech data 

business model transition metrics 

in order to help better understand our financial performance during and after the business model transition we use several metrics including recurring revenue total subscriptions arr and annualized revenue per subscription arps arr arps and recurring revenue are performance metrics and should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as arr arps and recurring revenue are not intended to be combined with those items our determination and presentation may differ from that of other companies please refer to the glossary of terms for the definitions of these metrics

the following table outlines our recurring revenue metric for the fiscal years ended 2018  2017  and 2016  



  

 

the following table outlines our arr subscriptions and arps metrics as of fiscal years ended january 31 2018 and 2017 



  

 

total arr increased 25 as of january 31 2018 as compared to the end of fiscal 2017 due to a 106 increase in subscription plan arr which for the first time represents the majority of our total arr the increase in subscription plan arr was driven by growth in all subscription plan types led by product subscription the increase was partially offset by an 18 decrease in maintenance plan arr 

subscription plan subscriptions increased 109 or approximately 12 million as compared to the end of fiscal 2017 driven by growth in all subscription plan types led by new product subscriptions subscription plan subscriptions benefited from approximately 342000 maintenance subscribers that were converted to product subscription under the maintenancetosubscription program during the fiscal year ended january 31 2018 

maintenance plan subscriptions decreased 28 or approximately 569000 as compared to the end of fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of the discontinuation of new maintenance agreement sales as well as the maintenancetosubscription program in which approximately 342000 maintenance plan subscriptions were converted to product subscription during the fiscal year 

2018 form 10k 43 

table of contents 

ended january 31 2018 the net decrease was expected and we expect to see ongoing declines in maintenance plan subscriptions going forward as part of the business model transition the rate of decline will vary based on the number of subscriptions subject to renewal the renewal rate and our ability to incentivize customers to switch over to enterprise business agreements ebas or product subscriptions 

arps was 553  a 5 increase compared to the prior fiscal year primarily driven by a 15 increase in maintenance plan arps as a result of the maintenancetosubscription program and a 14 increase in product subscription arps which is a component of our subscription plan partially offsetting the increase in maintenance plan and product subscription arps was a decrease in both cloud and eba subscription arps 

our arps is currently and will continue to be affected by various factors including subscription termlength migration from maintenance plan subscriptions geography and product mix promotions sales linearity within a quarter pricing changes and foreign currency we expect to see arps fluctuate up or down on a quarterly basis as we progress through our business model transition we expect all of the impacts of these factors to start to stabilize 

foreign currency analysis 

we generate a significant amount of our revenue in the us germany japan the united kingdom and canada 

the following table shows the impact of foreign exchanges rate changes on our net revenue and total spend 

  

 

changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue total spend and income loss from operations in future periods we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on a portion of the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions but do not attempt to completely mitigate the impact of fluctuations of such foreign currency against the us dollar 

deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue 

our deferred revenue balance at january 31 2018  was  196 billion and primarily relates to subscription and maintenance agreements invoiced for which the revenue has not yet been recognized but will be recognized as revenue ratably over the life of the contracts the term of our subscription contracts is typically between one and three years 

we define unbilled deferred revenue as contractually stated or committed orders under multiyear billing plans for subscription services license and maintenance for which the associated deferred revenue has not been recognized and the customer has not been invoiced unbilled deferred revenue is not included on our consolidated balance sheet until invoiced to the customer 



  

 

2018 form 10k 44 

table of contents 

we expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue and deferred revenue will change from quarter to quarter for several reasons including the specific timing duration and size of large customer subscription and support agreements varying billing cycles of such agreements the specific timing of customer renewals foreign currency fluctuations and the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue is recognized as revenue 

balance sheet and cash flow items 

at january 31 2018  we had  151 billion in cash and marketable securities this amount includes the aggregate net proceeds of  4920 million  after deducting the underwriting discounts and related offering expenses from our june 2017 registered underwritten public offering of  5000 million aggregate principal amount of 35 notes due june 15 2027  on july 27 2017 we redeemed in full  4000 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 195 senior notes due december 15 2017 to redeem the notes we used a portion of the proceeds of the june 2017 notes to pay a redemption price of approximately  4009 million  plus accrued and unpaid interest from june 15 2017 to but excluding the redemption date total cash repayment was  4018 million  our cash flow from operations decreased 99 to 09 million for the fiscal year ended january 31 2018 from 1697 million for the fiscal year ended january 31 2017  we repurchased 69 million shares of our common stock for  6901 million during fiscal 2018  comparatively we repurchased 97 million shares of our common stock for  6316 million during fiscal 2017  further discussion regarding the balance sheet and cash flow activities are discussed below under the heading “liquidity and capital resources” 

results of operations 

net revenue 

income statement presentation 

maintenance revenue consists of renewal fees for existing maintenance plan agreements that were initially purchased with a perpetual software license under our maintenance plan customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades when and if available and technical support we recognize maintenance revenue over the term of the agreements generally between one and three years 

subscription revenue consists of our termbased product subscriptions cloud service offerings and flexible enterprise business arrangements note that with the change in our presentation of revenue in our condensed consolidated statement of operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 our termbased product subscriptions and flexible enterprise business arrangements are classified and presented in a single line item revenue from these arrangements is recognized ratably over the contract term revenue for our cloud service offerings is recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date our service is made available to customers and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 

license and other revenue consists of 1 license revenue and 2 other revenue license revenue includes software license revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses other revenue includes revenue such as consulting and training and is recognized over time as the services are performed

our product offerings are focused in four primary product families aec mfg autocad and autocad lt “acad” and me during the business model transition revenue has been and will be negatively impacted as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than upfront and as new product offerings generally have a lower initial purchase price as part of the transition we discontinued selling new perpetual licenses of most individual software products effective february 1 2016 and discontinued selling new perpetual licenses of suites effective august 1 2016 these broad impacts are reflected in the summary below

net revenue by geographic area 



 

  constant currency data not provided at this level 

we believe that international revenue will continue to comprise a majority of our net revenue unfavorable economic conditions in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue including in emerging economies such as brazil russia india and china may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies have significantly affected and could continue to significantly affect our financial results for a given period even though we hedge a portion of our current and projected revenue increases to the levels of political and economic unpredictability in the global market may impact our future financial results additionally during the first three years of the business model transition revenue has been impacted as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than upfront and as new product offerings generally have a lower initial purchase price while the transition to a subscription model has had a broad impact within all markets it has had a particular impact to emerging economies as sales of perpetual licenses have historically comprised a greater percentage of total emerging economy sales in comparison to mature markets

interest and other expense net 

the following table sets forth the components of interest and other expense net 



interest and other expense net increased  240 million during fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  primarily related to increases in impairment losses on certain of our privatelyheld strategic investments and interest expense resulting from our june 2017 issuance of  5000 million aggregate principal amount of 35 notes due june 15 2027  

interest and other expense net increased  26 million during fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily related to a decrease in gains on certain of our privatelyheld strategic investments and an increase in losses on foreign currency this increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest and investments expense net that was primarily driven by mark to market gains on deferred compensation plans partially offset by an increase in interest expense resulting from the june 2015 issuance of  4500 million aggregate principal amount of 3125 senior notes due june 15 2020 and  3000 million aggregate principal amount of 4375 senior notes due june 15 2025  

interest expense and investment income fluctuates based on average cash marketable securities and debt balances average maturities and interest rates 

gains and losses on foreign currency are primarily due to the impact of remeasuring foreign currency transactions and net monetary assets into the functional currency of the corresponding entity the amount of the gain or loss on foreign currency is driven by the volume of foreign currency transactions and the foreign currency exchange rates for the year 

provision for income taxes 

we account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse 

income tax expense was 96 million and 583 million for fiscal 2018 and 2017  respectively relative to pretax losses of 5573 million and 5238 million  respectively for the same periods tax expense for fiscal 2018 consists primarily of foreign tax expense including withholding tax and tax amortization on indefinitelived intangibles offset by a benefit on the revaluation of our deferred tax liability due to the corporate rate reduction under the tax act tax expense for fiscal 2017 consisted primarily of foreign tax expense including withholding tax and tax amortization on indefinitelived intangibles 

the tax act was enacted on december 22 2017 and provides broad and significant changes to the us tax code and how the us imposes income tax on multinational corporations the tax act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously provided for in the us tax law these computations require significant judgments to be made regarding the interpretation of the provisions within the tax act along with preparation and analysis of information not previously required in conjunction with the tax act the sec issued sab 118 that allows for the company to record provisional amounts until a final assessment can be made within a period not to exceed one year from the date of enactment 

we have not completed our determination of the accounting implications of the tax act on our results of operations however we have reasonably estimated the effects of the tax act and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of january 31 2018 we recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the tax act of approximately 323 million this amount is primarily comprised of the remeasurement of our indefinitelived deferred tax liability resulting from the permanent reduction in the us statutory corporate rate from 35 to 21 we recorded a provisional estimate of the

mandatory onetime tax on accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that is primarily offset by other current year operating losses and net operating loss carryforwards that are fully valued resulting in no impact to the current year effective tax rate as additional regulatory guidance is issued and we continue to collect and analyze necessary data we may make adjustments to provisional amounts previously recorded we do not anticipate these adjustments to materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made since we are in a full valuation allowance in the us 

a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be recovered the valuation allowance is determined by assessing both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable such assessment is required on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis significant judgment is required in determining whether the valuation allowance should be recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we considered recent cumulative losses in the us arising from the companys business model transition as a significant source of negative evidence considering this negative evidence and the absence of sufficient positive objective evidence that we would generate sufficient taxable income in the us to realize the deferred tax assets we determined that it was more likely than not that the company would not realize the us federal and state deferred tax assets and recorded a full valuation allowance as we continually strive to optimize our overall business model tax planning strategies may become feasible whereby management may determine that it is more likely than not that the federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized as a result we will continue to evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax assets each quarter both in the us and in foreign jurisdictions based on all available evidence both positive and negative 

as of january 31 2018  the company had  3376 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which  3048 million would reduce our valuation allowance if recognized the remaining 328 million would impact the effective tax rate it is possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months however an estimate of the range of the possible change cannot be made at this time 

our future effective annual tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate changes in valuation allowances level of profit before tax accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits and changes in tax laws including impacts of the tax act a significant amount of our earnings is generated by our europe and asia pacific subsidiaries our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates 

at january 31 2018  we had noncurrent foreign net deferred tax assets of  680 million that management believes are more likely than not to be realized in future years

other financial information 

in addition to our results determined under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” discussed above we believe the following nongaap measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the fiscal years ended january 31 2018  2017  and 2016  our gross profit gross margin loss income from operations operating margin net loss income diluted net loss income per share and diluted shares used in per share calculation on a gaap and nongaap basis were as follows in millions except for gross margin operating margin and per share data 



  

 

 

for our internal budgeting and resource allocation process and as a means to provide consistency in periodtoperiod comparisons we use nongaap measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis these nongaap measures do not include certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results we also use nongaap measures in making operating decisions because we believe those measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our earning potential and performance for management by excluding certain benefits credits expenses and charges that may not be indicative of our core business operating results for the reasons set forth below we believe these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors both because 1 they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and 2 they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business this allows investors and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management compare financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the longterm performance of our core business we also use some of these measures for purposes of determining companywide incentive compensation 

there are limitations in using nongaap financial measures because nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies the nongaap financial measures included above are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results in addition they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the nongaap financial measures we compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a gaap basis as well as a nongaap basis and also by providing gaap measures in our public disclosures the presentation of nongaap financial information is meant to be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or in isolation from the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap we urge investors to review the reconciliation of our nongaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures included below and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business

our nongaap financial measures may exclude the following 

stockbased compensation expense s we exclude stockbased compensation expenses from nongaap measures primarily because they are noncash expenses and management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods moreover because of varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under fasb asc topic 718 we believe excluding stockbased compensation expenses allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies 

amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangibles we incur amortization of acquisitionrelated developed technology and purchased intangibles in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangibles is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions management finds it useful to exclude these variable charges from our cost of revenues to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangible assets will recur in future periods 

ceo transition costs we exclude amounts paid to the companys former ceos upon departure under the terms of their transition agreements including severance payments acceleration of restricted stock units and continued vesting of performance stock units and legal fees incurred with the transition also excluded from our nongaap measures are recruiting costs related to the search for a new ceo these costs represent nonrecurring expenses and are not indicative of our ongoing operating expenses we further believe that excluding the ceo transition costs from our nongaap results is useful to investors in that it allows for periodoverperiod comparability 

goodwill impairment this is a noncash charge to writedown goodwill to fair value when there was an indication that the asset was impaired as explained above management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

restructuring charges and other facility exit costs benefits net these expenses are associated with realigning our business strategies based on current economic conditions in connection with these restructuring actions or other exit actions we recognize costs related to termination benefits for former employees whose positions were eliminated the closure of facilities and cancellation of certain contracts we exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing business and operating results we believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses

table of contents 

loss gain on strategic investments we exclude gains and losses related to our strategic investments from our nongaap measures primarily because management finds it useful to exclude these variable gains and losses on these investments in assessing our financial results included in these amounts are noncash unrealized gains and losses on the derivative components and realized gains and losses on the sale or losses on the impairment of these investments we believe excluding these items is useful to investors because these excluded items do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business and these losses or gains were incurred in connection with strategic investments which do not occur regularly 

establishment of a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets this is a noncash charge to record a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets as explained above management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various cash expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

discrete tax items we exclude the gaap tax provision including discrete items from the nongaap measure of net loss income and include a nongaap tax provision based upon the projected annual nongaap effective tax rate discrete tax items include income tax expenses or benefits that do not relate to ordinary income from continuing operations in the current fiscal year unusual or infrequently occurring items or the tax impact of certain stockbased compensation examples of discrete tax items include but are not limited to certain changes in judgment and changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years certain costs related to business combinations certain changes in the ability to utilize deferred tax assets or changes in tax law management believes this approach assists investors in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations we believe the exclusion of these discrete tax items provides investors with useful supplemental information about our operational performance 

income tax effects on the difference between gaap and nongaap costs and expenses the income tax effects that are excluded from the nongaap measures relate to the tax impact on the difference between gaap and nongaap expenses primarily due to stockbased compensation amortization of purchased intangibles restructuring charges and other facilities exit costs and impacts of the corporate rate reduction and onetime deemed mandatory repatriation of certain foreign earnings under the tax act net for gaap and nongaap measures 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of cash is from subscriptions to our products maintenance payments and related services our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employeerelated expenses such as compensation and benefits as well as general operating expenses for marketing facilities and overhead costs in addition to operating expenses we also use cash to fund our stock repurchase program and invest in our growth initiatives which include acquisitions of products technology and businesses see further discussion of these items below 

at january 31 2018  our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  15 billion and net accounts receivable of  4382 million  

in june 2017 we issued  5000 million aggregate principal amount of 35 notes due june 15 2027  in june 2015 we issued  4500 million aggregate principal amount of 3125 notes due june 15 2020  and  3000 million aggregate principal amount of 4375 notes due june 15 2025  in december 2012 we issued  4000 million aggregate principal amount of 195 notes due december 15 2017  and  3500 million aggregate principal amount of 36 notes due december 15 2022 all five series of notes collectively the “notes” in july 2017 we redeemed in full  4000 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding 195 senior notes due december 15 2017  the redemption was completed pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of the first supplemental indenture dated december 13 2012 to redeem the notes we used a portion of the proceeds of the june 2017 notes to pay a redemption price of approximately  4009 million  plus accrued and unpaid interest total cash repayment was  4018 million  the company did not incur any additional early termination penalties relating to such redemption 

as of january 31 2018  we have  16 billion aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding in addition we have a line of credit facility that permits unsecured shortterm borrowings of up to  4000 million with a may 2020 maturity date with an option to request an increase in the amount of the credit facility by up to an additional 1000 million  this credit agreement contains customary covenants that could restrict the imposition of liens on our assets and restrict the company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness or make dispositions of assets if we fail to maintain the financial covenants the financial covenants consist of a maximum debt to total cash ratio a fixed charge coverage ratio through april 30 2018 and after april 30 2018 a minimum interest coverage ratio as of january 31 2018  we are compliant with all financial covenants related to our line of credit facility and as of march 22 2018 we have no amounts outstanding under the credit facility if we are unable to remain in compliance with the covenants we will not be able to draw on our credit facility borrowings under the credit facility and the

net proceeds from the offering of the notes are available for general corporate purposes 

our cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally our primary commercial banking relationship is with citigroup and its global affiliates in addition citibank na an affiliate of citigroup is one of the lead lenders and agent in the syndicate of our  4000 million line of credit 

longterm cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following repayment of debt common stock repurchases the acquisition of businesses software products or technologies complementary to our business and capital expenditures including the purchase and implementation of internaluse software applications 

our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products technology and businesses acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers however they entail cost and integration challenges and in certain instances negatively impact our operating margins we continually review these tradeoffs in making decisions regarding acquisitions we currently anticipate that we will continue to acquire products technology and businesses as compelling opportunities become available our decision to acquire businesses or technology is dependent on our business needs the availability of suitable sellers and technology and our own financial condition 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances are concentrated in a few locations around the world with substantial amounts held outside of the united states as of january 31 2018  approximately 74 of our total cash or cash equivalents and marketable securities are located in foreign jurisdictions and that percentage will fluctuate subject to business needs there are several factors that can impact our ability to utilize foreign cash balances such as foreign exchange restrictions foreign regulatory restrictions or adverse tax costs the tax act includes a mandatory onetime tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and generally eliminates us taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions in future periods as a result earnings in foreign jurisdictions are generally available for distribution to the us with little to no incremental us taxes we expect to meet our liquidity needs through current cash balances ongoing cash flows external borrowings or a combination we regularly review our capital structure and consider a variety of potential financing alternatives and planning strategies to ensure we have the proper liquidity available in the locations in which it is needed 

cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the risks detailed in part i item 1a titled “ risk factors ” however based on our current business plan and revenue prospects we believe that our existing balances our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months 

our revenue earnings cash flows receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for which we have put in place foreign currency contracts as part of our risk management strategy see part ii item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion 



net cash provided by operating activities of 09 million for fiscal 2018 consisted of 3307 million of noncash expenses including stockbased compensation expense depreciation amortization and accretion expense and 1357 million of cash flow provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities offsetting our net loss of 5669 million  

the primary working capital source of cash was an increase in deferred revenue from 17880 million as of january 31 2017  to 19551 million as of january 31 2018  the primary working capital uses of cash were decreases in accrued income taxes and other accrued liabilities 

net cash provided by investing was 5064 million for fiscal 2018 and was primarily due to the sale and maturities of marketable securities these cash inflows were partially offset by purchases of marketable securities and capital expenditures

at january 31 2018  our shortterm investment portfolio had an estimated fair value of  2452 million and a cost basis of  2364 million  the portfolio fair value consisted of 993 million invested in corporate debt securities 371 million invested in us government securities 275 million invested in commercial paper 131 million invested in asset backed securities and 92 million invested in other shortterm securities 

at january 31 2018   590 million of trading securities were invested in a defined set of mutual funds as directed by the participants in our deferred compensation plan see note 6  “ deferred compensation ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

net cash used in financing activities was 6566 million fiscal 2018 and was primarily due to repurchases of our common stock and the repayment of debt noted earlier in this section these cash outflows were offset in part by the issuance of debt also noted earlier in this section 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at january 31 2018  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 



 

 

notes consist of the senior notes issued in december 2012 june 2015 and june 2017 described above 

operating lease obligations consist primarily of obligations for facilities net of sublease income computer equipment and other equipment leases 

purchase obligations are contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services and are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on autodesk and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligations relate primarily to enterprise subscription agreements it infrastructure costs and marketing costs 

deferred compensation obligations relate to amounts held in a rabbi trust under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan see note 6  “ deferred compensation ” in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this plan 

pension obligations relate to our obligations for pension plans outside of the us see note 14  “ retirement benefit plans ” in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these obligations 

asset retirement obligations represent the estimated costs to bring certain office buildings that we lease back to their original condition after the termination of the lease 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase 

2018 form 10k 59 

table of contents 

orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months in addition we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees including limited product warranties historically costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant but because potential future costs are highly variable we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations 

issuer purchases of equity securities 

autodesks stock repurchase program provides autodesk with the ability to offset the dilution from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and reduce shares outstanding over time and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders under the share repurchase program autodesk may repurchase shares from time to time in open market transactions privatelynegotiated transactions accelerated share repurchase programs tender offers or by other means the share repurchase program does not have an expiration date and the pace and timing of repurchases will depend on factors such as cash generation from operations available surplus the volume of employee stock plan activity remaining shares available in the authorized pool cash requirements for acquisitions economic and market conditions stock price and legal and regulatory requirements 

during the three and twelve months ended january 31 2018  we repurchased 25 million and 69 million shares of our common stock respectively at january 31 2018  196 million shares remained available for repurchase under the repurchase program approved by the board of directors this programs does not have a fixed expiration date see note 9  “ stockholders deficit equity ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

foreign currency exchange risk 

our revenue earnings cash flows receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency volatility that exists as part of our ongoing business operations we utilize cash flow hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions in addition we use balance sheet hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables and payables as of january 31 2018  and 2017  we had open cash flow and balance sheet hedge contracts with future settlements within one to twelve months contracts were primarily denominated in euros japanese yen swiss francs british pounds canadian dollars and australian dollars we do not enter into foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes the notional amount of our option and forward contracts was  9495 million and  6400 million at january 31 2018  and 2017  respectively 

we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue and operating expenses of certain anticipated transactions a sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january 31 2018  indicated that a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 31 2018 and 2017 would increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by 579 million and 609 million  respectively a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the dollar from its value at january 31 2018  and 2017 would decrease the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by  832 million and  325 million  respectively 

interest rate risk 

interest rate movements affect both the interest income we earn on our shortterm investments and the market value of certain longer term securities at january 31 2018  we had 10786 million of cash equivalents and marketable securities including 2452 million classified as shortterm marketable securities and 1908 million classified as longterm marketable securities if interest rates were to move up by 50 or 100 basis points over a twelve month period the market value change of our marketable securities would have an unrealized gain or loss of 14 million and 28 million  respectively 

other market risk 

from time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies privately held company investments generally are considered inherently risky the technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies see note 2   financial instruments  for further discussion regarding our privately held investments

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2018  in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in the 2013 internal control—integrated framework our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within autodesk have been detected 

our management has concluded that as of january 31 2018  our internal control over financial reporting is effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in item 8 herein 

changes in internal control over financial reporting

product development and introduction 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware operating systems and software in addition our customers’ requirements and preferences rapidly evolve as do their expectations of the performance of our software and services to keep pace with these changes we maintain a vigorous program of new product development to address demands in the marketplace for our products 

the software industry is undergoing a transition from the personal computer to cloud social and mobile computing in fiscal 2017 we continued to successfully implement a strategic transition of our business model announced in fiscal 2014 to support our transition effective february 1 2016 we discontinued the sale of new commercial seats of most individual software products which are now exclusively available by desktop subscription and discontinued selling perpetual licenses of suites while introducing industry collections effective august 1 2016 industry collections allow access to a broad set of products and cloud services that exceeds those previously available in suites  simplifying the customers ability to access a complete set of industry tools we now offer termbased product subscriptions for individual products and industry collections cloud service offerings and flexible enterprise business agreements new model subscription offerings these offerings are designed to give our customers increased flexibility with how they use our products and service offerings and to attract a broader range of customers such as projectbased users and small businesses the transition to a subscription model reflects the significant and growing interaction of our desktop software and our cloud services working together to bring an integrated workflow to our customers 

we dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to further enhance our existing products and to create new products and technologies to expand our market opportunity for example in fiscal 2017 we continued strategically investing in digital manufacturing by bringing together a number of products and technologies focused on providing integrated solutions for additive subtractive hybrid manufacturing robotics and simulation digital manufacturing solutions provide our customers with the tools necessary to advance their manufacturing and production software processes and systems in order to achieve efficiency and cost reduction improvements digital manufacturing provides a unique opportunity for these customers to connect designing making and using we anticipate ongoing investments in digital manufacturing and other product groups to both serve existing customers and expand market opportunity 

research and development expenditures were 7661 million  or 38  of fiscal 2017  net revenue 7900 million  or 32  of fiscal 2016  net revenue and 7252 million  or 29  of fiscal 2015  net revenue the increase in research and development expenditures as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal 2016  and 2015  was driven by the decrease in our total revenue as a result of our business model transition our software is primarily developed internally however we also use independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities additionally we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing or licensing products and technology from third parties we continually review these investments in an effort to ensure that we are generating sufficient revenue or gaining a competitive advantage to justify their costs 

  

the majority of our research and product development is performed in the united states china singapore canada and the united kingdom however we employ experienced software developers in many of our other locations translation and localization of our products are performed in a number of local markets principally singapore and switzerland we generally localize and translate our products into german french italian spanish russian japanese korean and simplified and traditional chinese 

we plan to continue managing significant product development operations internationally over the next several years we believe that our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize

product development lower costs and integrate local market knowledge into our development activities we continually assess the significant costs and challenges including intellectual property protection against the benefits of our international development activities 

for further discussion regarding risks from our product development and introduction efforts see item 1a  “ risk factors ” 

marketing and sales 

we license or sell our products and services globally primarily through indirect channels consisting of distributors and resellers to a lesser extent we also transact directly with our enterprise and named account customers and with customers through our digitally transacted online autodesk branded store our indirect channel model includes both a twotiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a onetiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers we have a network of approximately 1700  resellers and distributors worldwide for fiscal 2017  approximately 72  of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the future 

  

we anticipate that our channel mix will continue to change particularly as we scale our digitally transacted online autodesk branded store business and our largest accounts shift towards directonly business models importantly we expect our indirect channel will continue to transact and support the majority of our revenue as we move beyond the business model transition we employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our reseller channel with our business strategies 

sales through our largest distributor tech data corporation and its global affiliates accounted for 30  25  and 25  of our net revenue for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively we believe our business is not substantially dependent on tech data our customers through tech data are the resellers and end users who purchase our software licenses and services should any of the agreements between us and tech data be terminated for any reason we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue no other distributor reseller or direct customer accounted for 10 or more of our revenue 

our customerrelated operations are divided into three geographic regions the americas europe middle east and africa “emea” and asia pacific “apac” each geographic region is supported by global marketing and sales organizations these organizations develop and manage overall marketing and sales programs and work closely with a network of domestic and international sales offices fiscal 2017  net revenue in the americas emea and apac was 8719 million   43  8004 million   39  and 3587 million   18  respectively we intend to continue to make our products available in foreign languages we believe that international sales will continue to comprise the majority of our total net revenue adverse economic conditions and currency exchange rates in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue including emerging economies may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance a summary of our financial information by geographic location is found in note 13  “ segments ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements our international operations and sales subject us to a variety of risks see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion 

we also work directly with reseller and distributor sales organizations computer manufacturers other software developers and peripherals manufacturers in cooperative advertising promotions and tradeshow presentations we employ massmarketing techniques such as webcasts seminars telemarketing direct mailings sponsorships advertising in business and trade journals and social media we have a worldwide user group organization and we have created online user communities dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products and services 

we generate revenue primarily through various offerings that provide recurring revenue the largest is our maintenance plan program under which customers who own a perpetual use license for the most recent version of the underlying product are able to renew a previously purchased maintenance plan that provides them with unspecified upgrades when and if available and receive online support during the term of their maintenance contract we also offer subscriptions which provide our customers with flexible termbased licenses of our software and services with the discontinuation of the sale of most perpetual licenses we have accelerated our transition away from selling a mix of perpetual licenses and maintenance plans toward a single subscription model

our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller networks the loss of or a significant reduction in business with any one of our major distributors or large resellers could harm our business see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion 

customer and reseller support 

we provide technical support and training to customers through a multitiered support model augmented by direct programs designed to address certain specific customer needs most of our customers receive support and training from the resellers and distributors from which they purchased subscriptions or licenses for our products or services with autodesk in turn providing second tier support to the resellers and distributors other customers are supported directly via selfservice using the autodesk knowledge network which guides customers to answers in our online support assets support forums webinars or to support representatives using a number of different modalities such as social media phone email and webchat we also support our resellers and distributors through technical product training sales training classes webinars and other knowledge sharing programs 

education sustainability and philanthropic programs

climate change 

in addressing the global challenges posed by climate change we make it possible for our customers to innovate and respond to associated changes in regulation building code physical climate parameters and other climaterelated developments this effort can directly and indirectly create more demand for existing and new autodesk products and services in the short and longterm furthermore our leadership is committed to taking climate action and that commitment goes handinhand with our reputation in the marketplace 

climate change management actions 

to drive continued progress and meet growing demand we continue to expand the solutions education and support we offer helping customers secure a competitive advantage for a low carbon future by designing highperformance buildings resilient cities and infrastructure and more efficient transportation and products to continue to grow this market we provide software and support to early stage entrepreneurs and startup companies who are designing clean technologies we plan to expand these offerings in the future based upon demand and opportunity in response to challenges posed by climate change 

internally we are investing in best practices to mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions and climate change risk through investments in renewable energy energy efficiency disaster management and recovery strategies and materials innovation we are on track to meet our sciencebased greenhouse gas reduction target of 43 absolute emissions by 2020

climate change governance 

ultimately our coceos have the highest level of direct responsibility for addressing our climatechange related risks and opportunities autodesk has established an environmental core team which reports indirectly to our coceos the environmental core team has direct responsibility for setting and implementing the corporate sustainability strategy including the climate change strategy 

emissions performance  other key performance indicators 

by end of fiscal 2016 autodesk had reduced its greenhouse gas emissions for its operational boundary by 33 from our fiscal year 2009 baseline to 172000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent this reduction was accomplished through increased investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency in our global real estate portfolio and continued transition from physical software delivery to cloud and electronic software delivery in fiscal 2017 we added emissions from our supply chain to our measurement boundary more information about our sustainability commitment can be found in our annual sustainability reports which we have published on our website since 2008 our fiscal 2017 sustainability report will be published in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 

philanthropy 

the autodesk foundation the foundation a privately funded 501c3 charity organization established and solely funded by us leads our philanthropic efforts the purpose of the foundation is twofold to support employees to create a better world at work at home and in the community by matching employee’s volunteer time andor donations to nonprofit organizations and to support organizations and individuals using design to drive positive social and environmental impact in the latter case we use grant funding software donations and training to accomplish this goal selecting the most impactful and innovative organizations around the world thus leading to a better future for our planet on our behalf the foundation also administers a discounted software donation program to nonprofit organizations social and environmental entrepreneurs and others who are developing design solutions that will shape a more sustainable future 

developer programs 

our business and our customers benefit from our relationships with an extensive developer network these developers create and sell their own interoperable products that further enhance the range of integrated solutions available to our customers one of our key strategies is to maintain an openarchitecture design of our software products to facilitate thirdparty development of complementary products and industryspecific software solutions this approach enables customers and thirdparties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses we offer several programs that provide strategic investment funding technological platforms user communities technical support forums and events to developers who develop addon applications for our products for example we have created our web services platform autodesk forge the forge platform includes a number of web services that enable software developers to rapidly develop the next generation of applications and experiences that will power the future of making things forge facilitates the development of a single connected ecosystem for integrating autodesk applications with other enterprise web and mobile solutions 

competition 

the markets for our products are highly competitive are subject to rapid change and can have complex interdependencies between many of the larger businesses we strive to increase our competitive separation by investing in research and development allowing us to bring new products to market and create exciting new versions of existing products that offer compelling efficiencies for our customers we also compete through investments in marketing and sales to more effectively reach new customers and better serve existing customers 

our competitors include large global publicly traded companies small geographically focused firms startup firms and solutions produced inhouse by their users our primary global competitors include adobe systems incorporated ansys inc apple inc aveva group plc avid technology inc bentley systems inc dassault systèmes sa and its subsidiary dassault systèmes solidworks corp environmental systems research institute inc esri intergraph corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of hexagon ab msc software corporation nemetschek ag ptc 3d systems siemens plm sony corporation technicolor and trimble navigation limited among others 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing power with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the industry is presently undergoing a 

2017 form 10k 10 

table of contents 

platform shift from the personal computer to cloud and mobile computing this shift further lowers barriers to entry and poses a disruptive challenge to established software companies the design software market is characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete both from existing competitors and by entry of new competitors with innovative technologies competition is increasingly enhanced by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies and the possibility that competitors in one vertical segment may enter other vertical segments that we serve in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources than we do because of these and other factors competitive conditions in these industries are likely to continue to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which could harm our business see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion of risks regarding competition 

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to better serve customers by offering new products including cloud and mobile computing products whether by internal development or acquisition and to continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to ease of use reliability performance range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation price and training 

intellectual property and licenses 

we maintain an active program to legally protect our investment in technology through intellectual property rights we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions the nature and extent of legal protection associated with each such intellectual property right depends on among other things the type of intellectual property right and the given jurisdiction in which such right arises we believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business 

nonetheless our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws and enforcement of the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws enforcement of intellectual property rights against alleged infringers can sometimes lead to costly litigation and counterclaims our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business 

from time to time we receive claims alleging infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights including patents disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to among other things costly litigation or product shipment delays which could harm our business 

we retain ownership of software we develop desktop software is licensed to users pursuant to ‘click through’ or signed license agreements containing restrictions on duplication disclosure and transfer cloud software and associated services are provided to users pursuant to online or signed terms of service agreements containing restrictions on access and use 

we believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our intellectual property and the rapid ongoing technological changes in both the computer hardware and software industries we must rely principally upon software engineering and marketing skills to continually maintain and enhance our competitive market position 

while we have recovered some revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the full extent to which piracy of our software products exists we believe however that software piracy is and can be expected to be a persistent problem that negatively impacts our revenue and financial results we believe that our transition from perpetual use software licenses to a subscriptionbased business model combined with the change from desktop to cloudbased computing will shift the incentives and means by which software is pirated 

in addition through various licensing arrangements we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others we expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing arrangements in the future as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions to support continued development and sales of our products and services some of these licensing arrangements require or may require royalty payments and other licensing fees the amount of these payments and fees may depend on various factors including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments offsetting considerations if any and the degree of use of the licensed technology

production and suppliers 

the production of our software products and services involves duplication or hosting of software media as we progress through our business model transition the way that we deliver software has evolved for certain cloudbased products we use a combination of infrastructureasaservice providers like amazon web services as well as colocated hosting facilities for other products we offer customers an electronic software download option for both initial product fulfillment as well as product updates for maintenance subscribers customers who choose electronic fulfillment receive the latest version of the software from our vendor’s secure servers customers may also obtain our software through media such as dvds and usb flash drives available from multiple sources the purchase of media and the transfer of the software programs onto media for distribution to customers are performed by us and by licensed subcontractors packaging materials are produced to our specifications by outside sources production is performed in leased facilities operated by independent thirdparty contractors to date we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the production of our software and documentation 

employees 

as of january 31 2017  we employed approximately 9000  people none of our employees in the united states are represented by a labor union in certain foreign countries our employees are represented by work councils we have never experienced any work stoppages and believe our employee relations are good reliance upon employees in other countries entails various risks and changes in these foreign countries such as government instability or regulation unfavorable to foreignowned businesses which could negatively impact our business in the future 

acquisitions 

over the past three years we acquired new technology or supplemented our technology by purchasing businesses or technology related assets focused in specific markets or industries for the fiscal years ended january 31 2017  2016  and 2015  we acquired a number of companies and technology related assets some of which were accounted for as business combinations the following were significant acquisitions for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015

risk factors 

tableend   

we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks a number of which are beyond our control in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following discussion highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on our business financial condition and future results of operations if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted causing the trading price of our common stock to decline in addition these risks and uncertainties may impact the “forwardlooking” statements described elsewhere in this form 10k and in the documents incorporated herein by reference they could affect our actual results of operations causing them to differ materially from those expressed in “forwardlooking” statements 

global economic and political conditions may further impact our business financial results and financial condition 

as our business has expanded globally we have increasingly become subject to risks arising from adverse changes in global economic and political conditions the past several years were characterized by mixed global economic conditions volatile credit markets volatile exchange rates relatively high unemployment increased government deficit spending and debt levels uncertainty about certain governments abilities to repay such debt or to address certain fiscal issues and volatility in many financial instrument markets if economic growth in countries where we do business slows such as in japan or in emerging economies or if such countries experience further economic recessions customers may delay or reduce technology purchases this could result in reductions in sales of our products and services longer sales cycles and slower adoption of our technologies 

over the past several years many of our customers have experienced tighter credit negative financial news and weaker financial performance of their businesses and have reduced their workforces thereby reducing the number of licenses and the number of maintenance contracts they purchase from us in addition a number of our customers rely directly and indirectly on government spending current debt balances of many countries without proportionate increases in revenues have caused many countries to reduce spending and in some cases have forced those countries to restructure their debt in an effort to avoid defaulting under those obligations this has not only impacted those countries but others that are holders of such debt and those assisting in such restructuring 

these actions may impact and over the past several years have negatively impacted our business financial results and financial condition moreover our financial performance may be negatively impacted by 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition in june 2016 voters in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” the brexit vote and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union may adversely affect business activity political stability and economic conditions in the united kingdom the european union and elsewhere

         it is uncertain at this time how the new us president administration and congress will affect our business including potentially through increased import tariffs and other influences on us trade relations with other countries such as mexico and china the imposition of tariffs or other trade barriers could increase our costs and reduce the competitiveness of our offerings in certain markets in addition other countries may change their own policies on business and foreign investment in companies in their respective countries 

geopolitical trends toward nationalism and protectionism and the weakening or dissolution of international trade pacts may increase the cost of or otherwise interfere with conducting business uncertainty about current and future economic and political conditions on us our customers and partners makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments 

further macroeconomic degradation a slower economic recovery in industries important to our business or adverse exchange rate movements may adversely affect our business financial results and financial condition 

if we fail to successfully manage our business model transition to cloudbased products and more flexible product licenses our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

to address the industry transition from personal computer to cloud mobile and social computing we have accelerated our move to the cloud and are offering more flexible product licenses to support our transition we discontinued selling new perpetual licenses of most individual software products effective february 1 2016 and discontinued selling new perpetual licenses of suites effective august 1 2016 as a result we expect to derive an increasing portion of our revenues in the future from subscriptions this subscription model prices and delivers our products in a way that differs from the historical perpetual pricing and delivery methods these changes reflect a significant shift from perpetual license sales and distribution of our software in favor of providing our customers the right to access certain of our software in a hosted environment or use downloaded software for a specified subscription period during our transition revenue billings gross margin operating margin net income loss earnings loss per share deferred revenue and cash flow from operations will be impacted as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than upfront and as new offerings bring a wider variety of price points 

our ability to achieve our financial objectives is subject to risks and uncertainties the new offerings require a considerable investment of technical financial legal and sales resources and a scalable organization market acceptance of such offerings is affected by a variety of factors including but not limited to security reliability performance current license terms customer preference socialcommunity engagement customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage their data public concerns regarding privacy and the enactment of restrictive laws or regulations whether our business model transition will prove successful and will accomplish our business and financial objectives is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including but not limited to customer demand attach and renewal rates channel acceptance our ability to further develop and scale infrastructure our ability to include functionality and usability in such offerings that address customer requirements tax and accounting implications pricing and our costs in addition the metrics we use to gauge the status of our business model transition may evolve over the course of the transition as significant trends emerge if we are unable to successfully establish these new offerings and navigate our business model transition in light of the foregoing risks and uncertainties our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

our strategy to develop and introduce new products and services exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance costs related to product defects and large expenditures each of which may not result in additional net revenue or could result in decreased net revenue 

rapid technological changes as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences characterize the software industry just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry 30 years ago we believe our industry is undergoing a similar transition from the personal computer to cloud mobile and social computing customers are also reconsidering the manner in which they license software products which requires us to constantly evaluate our business model and strategy in response we are focused on providing solutions to enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative on their projects we are also developing consumer products for digital art personal design and creativity and home design we devote significant resources to the development of new technologies in addition we frequently introduce new business models or methods that require a considerable investment of technical and financial resources such as our introduction of flexible license and service offerings it is uncertain whether these strategies will prove successful or whether we will be able to develop the necessary infrastructure and business models more quickly than our competitors we are making such investments through further development and enhancement of our existing products and services as well as through acquisitions of new product lines such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs and could result in decreased net revenue if we are not able to meet customer requirements either with respect to our software or 

2017 form 10k 15 

table of contents 

hardware products or the manner in which we provide such products or if we are not able to adapt our business model to meet our customers requirements our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted 

in particular a critical component of our growth strategy is to have customers of our autocad and autocad lt products expand their portfolios to include our other offerings and cloudbased services we want customers using individual autodesk products to expand their portfolio with our other offerings and cloudbased services and we are taking steps to accelerate this migration at times sales of licenses of our autocad and autocad lt or individual autodesk flagship products have decreased without a corresponding increase in industry collections or cloudbased services revenue or without purchases of customer seats to our industry collections should this continue our results of operations will be adversely affected also adoption of our cloud and mobile computing offerings and changes in the delivery of our software and services to our customers such as desktop subscription formerly referred to as rental offerings will change the way in which we recognize revenue relating to our software and services with a potential negative impact on our financial performance the accounting impact of these offerings and other business decisions are expected to result in an increase in the percentage of our ratable revenue as well as recurring revenue making for a more predictable business over time while potentially reducing our upfront perpetual revenue stream 

our executive management team must act quickly continuously and with vision given the rapidly changing customer expectations and technology advancements inherent in the software industry the extensive and complex efforts required to create useful and widely accepted products and the rapid evolution of cloud computing mobile devices new computing platforms and other technologies such as consumer products although we have articulated a strategy that we believe will fulfill these challenges if we fail to execute properly on that strategy or adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve we may fail to meet our customers expectations fail to compete with our competitors products and technology and lose the confidence of our channel partners and employees this in turn could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our entry into 3d printing presents many of the risks described above concerning developing and introducing new products as well as new risks for us the manufacturing and 3d printing markets are highly competitive and some of our competitors have experience and resources superior to ours we have limited experience designing developing and selling hardware products and no experience developing and selling printers the market for 3d printing is nascent and may not develop as rapidly as we expect our sale of 3d printers could subject us to product and other liability that we do not currently face if any of these risks materialize it could adversely affect our business and financial performance as well as our reputation and brand 

revenue from our offerings may be difficult to predict during our business model transition 

the discontinuance of our perpetual licenses for most individual software products on february 1 2016 and for perpetual suites on august 1 2016 has and will continue to result in the loss of future upfront licensing revenue this also has frozen the growth of our maintenance subscription revenue because there will be no further opportunities to attach maintenance licensing we expect our maintenance subscription revenue to decline over time but it may decline more quickly than anticipated due to low maintenance renewals at the same time our new model subscription revenue may not grow as rapidly as anticipated our new model subscription pricing allows customers to use our offerings at a lower initial cost when compared to the sale of a perpetual license although our new model subscriptions are designed to increase the number of customers who purchase offerings and create a recurring revenue stream that is more predictable over time it creates risks related to the timing of revenue recognition and expected reductions in cash flows in the near term 

we may not be able to predict subscription renewal rates and their impact on our future revenue and operating results 

our customers are not obligated to renew their subscriptions for our offerings and they may elect not to renew we cannot assure renewal rates or the mix of subscriptions renewals customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate due to a number of factors including offering pricing competitive offerings customer satisfaction and reductions in customer spending levels or customer activity due to economic downturns or financial markets uncertainty if our customers do not renew their subscriptions or if they renew on less favorable terms our revenues may decline

we are dependent on international revenue and operations exposing us to significant regulatory global economic intellectual property collections currency exchange rate taxation political instability and other risks which could adversely impact our financial results 

we are dependent on our international operations for a significant portion of our revenue international net revenue represented 63  and 68  of our net revenue in fiscal 2017  and 2016  respectively our international revenue including that from emerging economies is subject to general economic and political conditions in foreign markets including conditions in foreign markets resulting from economic and political conditions in the us our revenue is also impacted by the relative geographical and country mix of our revenue over time at times these factors adversely impact our international revenue and consequently our business as a whole our dependency on international revenue makes us much more exposed to global economic and political trends which can negatively impact our financial results even if our results in the us are strong for a particular period further a significant portion of our earnings from our international operations may not be freely transferable to the us due to remittance restrictions adverse tax consequences or other factors 

we anticipate that our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue and as we expand our international development sales and marketing expertise will provide significant support to our overall efforts in countries outside of the us 

risks inherent in our international operations include

some of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above 

the brexit vote has exacerbated and may further exacerbate many of the risks and uncertainties described above the proposed withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union could among other potential outcomes adversely affect the tax tax treaty currency operational legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject the withdrawal could also among other potential outcomes disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union and significantly disrupt trade between the united kingdom and the european union and other parties further uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the united kingdom and the other economies in which we operate 

even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks 

actions that we are taking to restructure our business in alignment with our business model transition strategy may be costly and may not be as effective as anticipated 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we commenced a companywide restructuring plan to accelerate the company’s move to the cloud and its transition to a subscriptionbased business model through the restructuring we sought to reduce expenses streamline the organization and reallocate resources to align more closely with the company’s needs going forward as a result of these actions we have incurred and may incur additional costs in the short term that have the effect of reducing our operating margins if we are unable to realize the expected outcomes from the restructuring efforts our business and operating results may be harmed 

our software is highly complex and may contain undetected errors defects or vulnerabilities each of which could harm our business and financial performance 

the software products that we offer are complex and despite extensive testing and quality control may contain errors defects or vulnerabilities some errors defects and vulnerabilities in our software products may only be discovered after the product or service has been released any errors defects or vulnerabilities could result in the need for corrective releases to our software products damage to our reputation loss of revenue an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products any of which would likely harm our business and financial performance 

existing and increased competition and rapidly evolving technological changes may reduce our revenue and profits 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing devices with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the industry is presently undergoing a platform shift from the personal computer to cloud and mobile computing this shift further lowers barriers to entry and poses a disruptive challenge to established software companies the markets in which we compete are characterized by vigorous competition both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources furthermore a reduction in the number and availability of compatible thirdparty applications or our inability to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes including those related to cloud computing mobile devices and new computing platforms may adversely affect the sale of our products because of these and other factors competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which would likely harm our business 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the us and we make certain business and resource decisions based on assumptions about foreign currency we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change for example the june 23 2016 announcement of brexit caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate 

2017 form 10k 18 

table of contents 

fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business our exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 

we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our cash flow exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as part of our risk management strategy we use foreign currency contracts to manage a portion of our exposures of underlying assets liabilities and other obligations which exist as part of our ongoing business operations these foreign currency instruments have maturities that extend for one to twelve months in the future and provide us with some protection against currency exposures however our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be completely successful resulting in an adverse impact on our financial results 

the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period although our foreign currency cash flow hedge program extends beyond the current quarter in order to reduce our exposure to foreign currency volatility we do not attempt to completely mitigate this risk and in any case will incur transaction fees in adopting such hedging programs such volatility even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings 

a breach of security in our products services or computer systems may compromise the integrity of our products or services harm our reputation create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results 

we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our source code and computer systems the risk of a security breach or disruption particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyber terrorists has increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased these threats include but are not limited to identity theft unauthorized access dns attacks wireless network attacks viruses and worms advanced persistent threat apt application centric attacks peertopeer attacks phishing backdoor trojans and distributed denial of service ddos attacks any of the foregoing could attack our products services or computer systems despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such programs it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk like all software our software is vulnerable to cyber attacks in the past hackers have targeted our software and they may do so in the future the impact of cyber attacks could disrupt the proper functioning of our software products or services cause errors in the output of our customers work allow unauthorized access to sensitive proprietary or confidential information of ours or our customers and other destructive outcomes moreover as we continue to invest in new lines of consumer products and services we are exposed to increased security risks and the potential for unauthorized access to or improper use of the information of our consumer users for example cyber attacks could make our customers hesitant to adopt our cloudbased hosted subscription services which could negatively impact our business model transition if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation may suffer customers may stop buying our products or services we could face lawsuits and potential liability and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

changes in laws or regulations related to the internet local data storage or related to privacy and data security concerns may impact our business or expose us to increased liability 

the future success of our business depends upon the continued use of the internet as a primary medium for commerce communication and business applications federal state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws or regulations affecting data privacy and the transmission of certain types of content using the internet for example the state of california has adopted legislation requiring operators of commercial websites and mobile applications that collect personal information from california residents to conspicuously post and comply with privacy policies that satisfy certain requirements several other us states have adopted legislation requiring companies to protect the security of personal information that they collect from consumers over the internet and more states may adopt similar legislation in the future additionally the federal trade commission has used its authority under section 5 of the federal trade commission act to bring actions against companies for failing to maintain adequate security for personal information collected from consumers over the internet and for failing to comply with privacy related representations made to internet users the us congress has at various times proposed federal legislation intended to protect the privacy of internet users and the security of personal information collected from internet users that would impose additional compliance burdens upon companies collecting personal information from internet users and the us congress may adopt such legislation in the future the european union also has adopted various directives regulating data privacy and security and the transmission of content using the internet involving residents of the european union including those directives known as the data protection directive the eprivacy directive and the privacy and electronic communications directive and may adopt similar directives in the future other countries including canada and several latin american and asian countries have constitutional protections for or have adopted legislation protecting individuals personal information additionally some federal state or foreign governmental bodies have 

2017 form 10k 19 

table of contents 

established laws that seek to censor the transmission of certain types of content over the internet or require that individuals be provided with the ability to permanently delete all electronic personal information such as the german multimedia law of 1997 and the california “eraser law” for minors additionally some foreign governmental bodies such as russia and china have established laws or have proposed laws that seek to require local data storage 

in addition new laws and industry selfregulatory codes have been enacted and more are being considered that may affect our ability to reach current and prospective customers to understand how our products and services are being used to respond to customer requests allowed under the laws and to implement our new business models effectively these new laws and regulations would similarly affect our competitors as well as our customers 

given the variety of global privacy and data protection regimes it is possible we may find ourselves subject to inconsistent obligations for instance the usa patriot act is considered by some to be in conflict with certain directives of the european union situations such as these require that we make prospective determinations regarding compliance with conflicting regulations increased enforcement of existing laws and regulations as well as any laws regulations or changes that may be adopted or implemented in the future could limit the growth of the use of public cloud applications or communications generally result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internetbased applications and require us to implement additional technological safeguards 

in addition in october 2015 the european court of justice issued a ruling immediately invalidating the useu safe harbor framework which facilitated personal data transfers to the us in compliance with applicable eu data protection laws in february 2016 the european commission and the united states agreed on a new framework for transatlantic data flows the euus privacy shield we rely on other legal mechanisms for data transfer and continue to comply with the previous useu safe harbor framework and usswiss safe harbor framework as set forth by the us department of commerce regarding the collection use and retention of personal information from european union member countries and switzerland 

increasing regulatory focus on privacy issues could impact our new business models and expose us to increased liability 

governments privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect process use store share or transmit personal data any perception of our practices or products as an invasion of privacy whether or not consistent with current regulations and industry practices may subject us to public criticism class action lawsuits reputational harm or claims by regulators industry groups or other third parties all of which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability 

we rely on thirdparties to provide us with a number of operational services including hosting and delivery and certain of our customer services and other operations and processing of data any interruption or delay in service from these third parties breaches of security or privacy could expose us to liability harm our reputation and adversely impact our financial performance 

we increasingly rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide our customers and computer operations for our internal use as we gather customer data and host certain customer data in thirdparty facilities a security breach could compromise the integrity or availability or result in the theft of customer data in addition our operations could be negatively affected in the event of a security breach and we could be subject to the loss or theft of confidential or proprietary information including source code 

unauthorized access to this data may be obtained through breakins breaches of our secure networks by unauthorized parties employee theft or misuse or other misconduct we rely on a number of third party suppliers in the operation of our business for the provision of various services and materials that we use in the operation of our business and production of our products we may from time to time rely on a single or limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country for these services or materials the inability of such third parties to satisfy our requirements could disrupt our business operations or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy if any of these situations were to occur our reputation could be harmed we could be subject to third party liability including under data protection and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

if we do not maintain good relationships with the members of our distribution channel or achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected if our distribution channel suffers financial losses becomes financially unstable or insolvent or is not provided the right mix of incentives to sell our products our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected 

2017 form 10k 20 

table of contents 

we sell our software products both directly to endusers and through a network of distributors and resellers for fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  approximately 72  and 79  respectively of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the future our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller network computer software distributors and resellers typically are not highly capitalized have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and experienced difficulties during the past several years we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of distributors and resellers prior to our sales to them in the past we have taken steps to support them and may take additional steps in the future such as extending credit terms and providing temporary discounts these steps if taken could harm our financial results if our distributors and resellers were to become insolvent they would not be able to maintain their business and sales or provide customer support services which would negatively impact our business and revenue 

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including the distributor tech data corporation and its global affiliates “tech data” tech data accounted for 30   and   25  of our total net revenue for fiscal 2017  and 2016  respectively although we believe that we are not substantially dependent on tech data if tech data were to experience a significant disruption with its business or if our relationship with tech data were to significantly deteriorate it is possible that our ability to sell to end users would be at least temporarily negatively impacted this could in turn negatively impact our financial results 

over time we have modified and will continue to modify aspects of our relationship with our distributors and resellers such as their incentive programs pricing to them and our distribution model to motivate and reward them for aligning their businesses with our strategy and business objectives changes in these relationships and underlying programs could negatively impact their business and harm our business in addition the loss of or a significant reduction in business with those distributors or resellers or the failure to achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough with any one of our major international distributors or large resellers could harm our business in particular if one or more of such distributors or resellers were unable to meet their obligations with respect to accounts payable to us we could be forced to write off such accounts and may be required to delay the recognition of revenue on future sales to these customers these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

a significant portion of our revenue is generated through maintenance revenue if decreases in maintenance revenue are not offset by increases in new model subscription revenue our future revenue and financial results will be negatively impacted 

our maintenance customers have no obligation to renew their maintenance contracts after the expiration of their maintenance period which is typically one year the discontinuance of our perpetual licenses for most individual software products on february 1 2016 and for perpetual suites on august 1 2016 resulted in the loss of future maintenance attach opportunities we expect customer renewal rates will decline or fluctuate over time as a result of a number of factors including the overall global economy the health of their businesses the perceived value of the maintenance program and planned maintenance pricing increases if our nonrenewing maintenance customers do not transition to our new business model subscriptions our future revenue and financial results will be negatively impacted 

we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the term of the maintenance contracts which is predominantly one year but may also range up to five years decreases in maintenance billings will negatively impact future maintenance revenue however future maintenance revenue will also be impacted by other factors such as the amount timing and mix of contract terms of future billings 

our financial results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenue and financial results difficult to predict 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so in the future these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines we also provide investors with quarterly and annual financial forwardlooking guidance that could prove to be inaccurate as a result of these fluctuations in addition to the other factors described in this part i item 1a some of the factors that could cause our financial results to fluctuate include

we have also experienced fluctuations in financial results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic or political conditions in particular our financial results in europe during our third quarter are usually affected by a slower summer period and our apac operations typically experience seasonal slowing in our third and fourth quarters 

our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenue and are relatively fixed in the short term accordingly any revenue shortfall below expectations has had and in the future could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability greater than anticipated expenses or a failure to maintain rigorous cost controls would also negatively affect profitability 

our business could suffer as a result of risks costs charges and integration risks associated with strategic acquisitions and investments 

we regularly acquire or invest in businesses software products and technologies that are complementary to our business through acquisitions strategic alliances or equity or debt investments the risks associated with such acquisitions include among others the difficulty of assimilating products operations and personnel inheriting liabilities such as intellectual property infringement claims the failure to realize anticipated revenue and cost projections the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business in accordance with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the diversion of managements time and attention for example we face risks relating to our fiscal 2017 integration of our delcam subsidiaries which previously operated autonomously 

in addition such acquisitions and investments involve other risks such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2017 form 10k 23 

table of contents 

 

we may not be successful in overcoming such risks and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business in addition such acquisitions and investments have in the past and may in the future contribute to potential fluctuations in our quarterly financial results these fluctuations could arise from transactionrelated costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or writeoffs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments these costs or charges could negatively impact our financial results for a given period cause quarter to quarter variability in our financial results or negatively impact our financial results for several future periods 

because we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from a small number of products including our autocadbased software products and collections if these products are not successful our revenue will be adversely affected 

we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from sales of licenses of a limited number of our products including autocad software products based on autocad which include our collections that serve specific markets and products that are interoperable with autocad any factor adversely affecting sales of these products including the product release cycle market acceptance product competition performance and reliability reputation price competition economic and market conditions and the availability of thirdparty applications would likely harm our financial results during fiscal 2017  and 2016  combined revenue from our autocad and autocad lt products not including collections formerly suites having autocad or autocad lt as a component represented 16   and 24   of our total net revenue respectively 

if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights our business could be harmed 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright and trademark laws trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software products or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our software products is timeconsuming and costly we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists and we expect that software piracy will remain a persistent problem particularly in emerging economies furthermore our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 

additionally we actively protect the secrecy of our confidential information and trade secrets including our source code if unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code the loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for thirdparties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our financial performance and our reputation we also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of nondisclosure agreements with our customers contractors vendors and partners however it is possible that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization if this were to occur it may be difficult andor costly for us to enforce our rights and our financial performance and reputation could be negatively impacted 

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in the loss of significant rights 

as more software patents are granted worldwide the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims infringement or misappropriation claims have in the past been and may in the future be asserted against us and any such assertions could harm our business additionally certain patent holders without products have become more aggressive in threatening and pursuing litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents any such claims or threats whether with or without merit have been and could in the future be timeconsuming to defend result in costly litigation and diversion of resources cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in addition such royalty or license agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms if at all which would likely harm our business

from time to time we realign or introduce new business and sales initiatives if we fail to successfully execute and manage these initiatives our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

as part of our effort to accommodate our customers needs and demands and the rapid evolution of technology we from time to time evolve our business and sales initiatives such as realigning our development and marketing organizations offering software as a service and realigning our internal resources in an effort to improve efficiency we may take such actions without clear indications that they will prove successful and at times we have been met with shortterm challenges in the execution of such initiatives market acceptance of any new business or sales initiative is dependent on our ability to match our customers needs at the right time and price often we have limited prior experience and operating history in these new areas of emphasis if any of our assumptions about expenses revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated and our financial results will be negatively impacted 

if we fail to remediate the material weakness identified in our internal control over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future the accuracy and timeliness of our financial and operating reporting may be adversely affected and could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended january 31 2017 our management concluded that it has a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the operating effectiveness of our controls over the calculation of income tax expense a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

management first identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting in connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended october 31 2015 since that time management’s remediation activities have included the following 

 

 

 

 

management has enhanced its controls to include refinements and improvements to controls over the accounting for income taxes while significant progress has been made as of january 31 2017 management does not believe these controls are operating effectively as a result management does not believe that the material weakness has been remediated and will continue to enhance its controls over the accounting for income tax expense 

there can be no assurance that our remedial measures will be sufficient to address the material weakness or that our internal control over financial reporting will not be subject to additional material weaknesses in the future if the remedial measures that we take are insufficient to address our material weakness or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results additionally we may encounter problems or delays in implementing any changes necessary for management to make a favorable assessment of our internal control over financial reporting if we cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting investors could lose confidence in our financial reports and the price of our common stock could decline 

net revenue billings earnings or subscriptions shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline

the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including the other factors described in this part i  item 1a  and the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant changes in the price of our common stock could expose us to costly and timeconsuming litigation historically after periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities a company becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts managements attention and resources 

our ceo transition may cause uncertainty regarding the future of our business and impact employee hiring and retention 

carl bass resigned as our president and ceo effective february 8 2017 after having held such positions for over ten years in connection with mr bass’ resignation the board has instituted a ceo search to consider candidates inside and outside autodesk and has formed an interim office of the chief executive to oversee the company’s daytoday operations the ceo transition and any related speculation and uncertainty regarding our future business strategy and direction in connection with the search and the appointment of a permanent ceo may cause or result in 

 

 

 

 

our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our success and ability to invest and grow depend largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical professional managerial sales and marketing personnel historically competition for these key personnel has been intense the loss of services of any of our key personnel including key personnel joining our company through acquisitions the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions and financial goals

our investment portfolio consists of a variety of investment vehicles in a number of countries that are subject to interest rate trends market volatility and other economic factors if general economic conditions decline this could cause the credit ratings of our investments to deteriorate illiquidity in the financial marketplace and we may experience a decline in interest income and an inability to sell our investments leading to impairment in the value of our investments 

it is our policy to invest our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in highly liquid instruments with and in the custody of financial institutions with high credit ratings and to limit the amounts invested with any one institution type of security and issuer however we are subject to general economic conditions interest rate trends and volatility in the financial marketplace that can affect the income that we receive from our investments the net realizable value of our investments including our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and our ability to sell them in the us for example the yields on our portfolio securities are very low due to general economic conditions any one of these factors could reduce our investment income or result in material charges which in turn could impact our overall net income loss and earnings loss per share 

from time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies privately held company investments are considered inherently risky the technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies 

a loss on any of our investments may cause us to record an otherthantemporary impairment charge the effect of this charge could impact our overall net income loss and earnings loss per share in any of these scenarios our liquidity may be negatively impacted which in turn may prohibit us from making investments in our business taking advantage of opportunities and potentially meeting our financial obligations as they come due 

we are subject to legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries and we may be named in additional legal proceedings or become involved in regulatory inquiries in the future all of which are costly distracting to our core business and could result in an unfavorable outcome or a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or the trading prices for our securities 

we are involved in legal proceedings and receive inquiries from regulatory agencies as the global economy has changed and our business has evolved we have seen an increase in litigation activity and regulatory inquiries like many other high technology companies the number and frequency of inquiries from us and foreign regulatory agencies we have received regarding our business and our business practices and the business practices of others in our industry have increased in recent years in the event that we are involved in significant disputes or are the subject of a formal action by a regulatory agency we could be exposed to costly and time consuming legal proceedings that could result in any number of outcomes any claims or regulatory actions initiated by or against us whether successful or not could result in expensive costs of defense costly damage awards injunctive relief increased costs of business fines or orders to change certain business practices significant dedication of management time diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business in any of these cases our financial results results of operations cash flows or the trading prices for our securities could be negatively impacted 

changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business further such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective 

for example the usbased financial accounting standards board “fasb” is currently working together with the international accounting standards board “iasb” on several projects to further align accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies who are required to follow us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” under sec regulations and those who are required to follow international financial reporting standards ifrs outside of the us these efforts by the fasb and iasb may result in different accounting principles under gaap

that may result in materially different financial results for us in areas including but not limited to principles for recognizing revenue and lease accounting 

furthermore in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under us gaap this standard establishes a principle for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services the standard also provides guidance on the recognition of costs related to obtaining and fulfilling customer contracts in august 2015 the fasb subsequently issued asu 201514 which deferred the effectiveness of asu 201409 so that it will now be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 including interim periods within that reporting period the revised effective date for the company under the new standard will be the beginning of fiscal 2019 we are assessing the impact on our consolidated financial statements defining our operational requirements and implementing changes to our policies procedures and systems this new standard is both technical and complex and we expect to incur significant ongoing costs to implement and maintain compliance with this new standard in addition there may be greater uncertainty with respect to projecting revenue results from future operations as we work through the new revenue recognition standard 

it is not clear whether we have the proper systems and controls in place to accommodate such changes and the impact that any such changes may have on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows adoption of asu no 201409 along with any other changes in accounting principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change any difficulties in the implementation of new or changed accounting standards including asu no 201409 could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations if our estimates relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions or judgments that change or prove to be incorrect our operating results could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in our stock price in addition as we evolve and change our business and sales models we are currently unable to determine how these potential changes may impact our new models particularly in the area of revenue recognition 

we are investing in resources to update and improve our information technology systems should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems disrupt our operations our business model transition could be compromised and our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network and data center infrastructure technology systems and our websites for our development marketing operational support sales accounting and financial reporting activities we continually invest resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet the growing and evolving requirements of our business and customers in particular our transition to cloudbased products and a subscription only business model requires considerable investment in the development of technologies and back office systems for technical financial compliance and sales resources to enable a scalable organization 

such improvements are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or uncover problems with our existing technology systems unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in disruption in our business operations loss of revenue errors in our accounting and financial reporting or damage to our reputation and could compromise our business model transition 

in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements which if not accurate may significantly impact our financial results 

we make assumptions judgments and estimates for a number of items including the fair value of financial instruments goodwill longlived assets and other intangible assets the realizability of deferred tax assets and the fair value of stock awards we also make assumptions judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee related liabilities including commissions bonuses and sabbaticals and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions partner incentive programs product returns reserves allowances for doubtful accounts asset retirement obligations and legal contingencies these assumptions judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from our estimates and such differences could significantly impact our financial results

we are subject to risks related to taxation in multiple jurisdictions 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions our effective tax rate is primarily based on our expected geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany arrangements including the manner in which we develop value and license our intellectual property and enacted tax rules significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis while we believe our tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 

tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied increasingly governmental tax authorities are scrutinizing corporate tax strategies many countries in the european union as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that if enacted could increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business if us or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge the manner in which our profits are currently recognized our overall taxes could increase and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted 

we rely on third party technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies our product and service development may be delayed and our financial results negatively impacted 

we rely on certain software that we license from third parties including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions these thirdparty software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and the software may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software can be developed identified licensed and integrated which would likely harm our business 

disruptions with licensing relationships and third party developers could adversely impact our business 

we license certain key technologies from third parties licenses may be restricted in the term or the use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business similarly we may not be able to obtain or renew license agreements for key technology on favorable terms if at all and any failure to do so could harm our business 

our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with thirdparty developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn in particular markets such disruptions have in the past and would likely in the future negatively impact these thirdparty developers and end users which could harm our business 

additionally technology created by outsourced product development whether outsourced to third parties or developed externally and transferred to us through business or technology acquisitions has certain additional risks such as effective integration into existing products adequate transfer of technology knowhow and ownership and protection of transferred intellectual property 

as a result of our strategy of partnering with other companies for product development our product delivery schedules could be adversely affected if we experience difficulties with our product development partners 

we partner with certain independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities we believe our partnering strategy allows us to among other things achieve efficiencies in developing new products and maintaining and enhancing existing product offerings our partnering strategy creates a dependency on such independent developers independent developers including those who currently develop products for us in the us and throughout the world may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future in addition use of development resources through consulting relationships particularly in nonus jurisdictions with developing legal systems may be adversely impacted by and expose us to risks relating to evolving employment export and intellectual property laws these risks could among other things expose our intellectual property to misappropriation and result in disruptions to product delivery schedules

our business may be significantly disrupted upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event 

our business is highly automated and relies extensively on the availability of our network and data center infrastructure our internal technology systems and our websites we also rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide to our customers and computer operations for our internal use the failure of our systems or hosted computer services due to a catastrophic event such as an earthquake fire flood tsunami weather event telecommunications failure power failure cyber attack terrorism or war could adversely impact our business financial results and financial condition we have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems in order to reduce the potential impact of a catastrophic event however there can be no assurance that these plans and systems would enable us to return to normal business operations in addition any such event could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products this could in turn decrease that countrys or regions demand for our products thereby negatively impacting our financial results 

if we were required to record an impairment charge related to the value of our longlived assets or an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets our results of operations would be adversely affected 

our longlived assets are tested for impairment if indicators of impairment exist if impairment testing shows that the carrying value of our longlived assets exceeds their estimated fair values we would be required to record a noncash impairment charge which would decrease the carrying value of our longlived assets as the case may be and our results of operations would be adversely affected our deferred tax assets include net operating loss amortizable tax assets and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods each quarter we assess the need for a valuation allowance considering both positive and negative evidence to determine whether all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in fiscal 2016 we determined that it was more likely than not that the company would not realize our us deferred tax assets and established a valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets we continued to have a full valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets in 2017 and increased the amount of the valuation allowance to include deferred tax assets generated in 2017 including deferred tax assets that were established as a result of the adoption of asu 20169 in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 changes in the amount of the valuation allowance could result in a material noncash expense or benefit in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted and our results of operations could be materially affected we will continue to perform these tests and any future adjustments may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we issued  15 billion  aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes in debt offerings and have an existing  4000 million  revolving credit facility and expect to incur other debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

in june 2015 we issued 3125 notes due june 15 2020 in an aggregate principal amount of  4500 million  and 4375 notes due june 15 2025 in an aggregate principal amount of  3000 million  in december 2012 we issued 195 notes due december 15 2017 in an aggregate principal amount of  4000 million  and 36 notes due december 15 2022 in an aggregate principal amount of  3500 million  as the debt matures we will have to expend significant resources to either repay or refinance these notes if we decide to refinance the notes we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all both of which may adversely affect our financial condition 

we also have a  4000 million  revolving credit facility as of january 31 2017  we had no outstanding borrowings on the line of credit although we have no current plans to borrow under this credit facility we may use the proceeds of any future borrowing for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business our existing and future levels of indebtedness may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 

 

 

 

this credit agreement contains customary covenants that could restrict the imposition of liens on autodesk’s assets and restrict the company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness or make dispositions of assets if autodesk fails to maintain the financial covenants the financial covenants consist of a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio we are required to comply with the covenants set forth in our unsecured notes and revolving credit facility our ability to comply with these

covenants may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or lenders then subject to applicable cure periods any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable as a result of the business model transition the leverage ratio requirement of the credit agreement was waived during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 autodesk is discussing amendments to the financial covenants in the credit agreement with the lenders and expects to conclude this process during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 if we are unable to obtain an agreement on modified covenants that the company can meet during our business model transition we may cancel this credit agreement which would decrease our liquidity by 400 million in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities under certain circumstances if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility could increase downgrades in our credit ratings could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing

strategy 

autodesk makes software for people who make things if youve ever driven a highperformance car admired a towering skyscraper used a smartphone or watched a great film chances are youve experienced what millions of autodesk customers are doing with our software autodesk gives you the power to make anything 

autodesk was founded during the platform transition from mainframe computers and engineering workstations to personal computers we developed and sustained a compelling value proposition based upon desktop software for the personal computer just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry over 30 years ago we believe our industry is undergoing a similar transition from the personal computer to cloud mobile and social computing to address this transition we have accelerated our move to the cloud and mobile devices and are offering more flexible licensing our product subscriptions presently represent a hybrid of desktop software and cloudbased functionality which provides a deviceindependent collaborative design workflow for designers and their stakeholders our cloud service offerings for example bim 360 shotgun fusion 360 and autocad 360 pro provide tools including mobile and social capabilities to help streamline design collaboration and data management processes we believe that customer adoption of these new offerings will continue to grow as customers across a range of industries begin to take advantage of the scalable computing power and flexibility provided through these new services 

our strategy is to lead the industries we serve to cloudbased technologies and business models this entails both a technological shift and a business model shift as part of the transition we discontinued selling new perpetual licenses of most individual software products effective february 1 2016 and discontinued selling new perpetual licenses of suites while introducing industry collections effective august 1 2016 industry collections allow access to a broad set of products and services that exceeds those previously available in suites  simplifying the customer ability to get access to a complete set of tools for their industry we now offer subscriptions for individual products and industry collections cloud service offerings and flexible enterprise business agreements new model subscription offerings these offerings are designed to give our customers more flexibility with how they use our products and service offerings and to attract a broader range of customers such as projectbased users and small businesses 

with the discontinuation of the sale of most perpetual licenses we have accelerated our transition away from selling a mix of perpetual licenses and termbased product subscriptions toward a single subscription model as a result of this shift and various other factors described in note 13   segments  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we have 

2017 form 10k 36 

table of contents 

reassessed the way we allocate resources and evaluate financial performance and now operate as a single operating segment during the transition revenue margins eps deferred revenue and cash flow from operations have been and will be impacted as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than upfront and as new product subscription offerings generally have a lower initial purchase price   

as we progress through the business model transition reported revenue is less relevant to measure the success of the business as perpetual license sales have been discontinued in favor of subscription offerings which have considerably lower upfront prices annualized recurring revenue arr and growth of subscriptions better reflect business momentum and provide additional transparency into the transition to further analyze progress we disaggregate our growth in these metrics between the original maintenance model maintenance and the new model subscription offerings maintenance subscriptions peaked in the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2016 and we expect them to decline slowly over time 

we sell our products and services globally through a combination of indirect and direct channels during the fiscal year ended   january 31 2017  2016  and 2015  our indirect channels which include value added resellers direct market resellers distributors computer manufacturers and other software developers were responsible for 72  79  and 83  of our overall revenue respectively during the same periods our direct channels which include sales resources dedicated to selling in our largest accounts our highly specialized products and business transacted through our online autodesk branded store were responsible for 28  21  and 17  of our overall revenue respectively 

we anticipate that our channel mix will continue to change particularly as we scale our digitally transacted online autodesk branded store business and our largest accounts shift towards directonly business models importantly we expect our indirect channel will continue to transact and support the majority of our revenue as we move beyond the business model transition we employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our direct and indirect channels with our business strategies in addition we have a worldwide user group organization and we have created online user communities dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products 

one of our key strategies is to maintain an openarchitecture design of our software products to facilitate thirdparty development of complementary products and industryspecific software solutions this approach enables customers and third parties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses we offer several programs that provide strategic investment funding technological platforms user communities technical support forums and events to developers who develop addon applications for our products for example we have established the autodesk spark program to support ideas that push the boundaries of 3d printing and nurture the companies that will advance innovations within 3d printing hardware and software we have also created the autodesk forge program to support innovators that build solutions to facilitate the development of a single connected ecosystem for the future of how things are designed made and used 

in addition to the competitive advantages afforded by our technology our large global network of distributors resellers thirdparty developers customers educational institutions educators and students is a key competitive advantage this network of partners and relationships provides us with a broad and deep reach into volume markets around the world our distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with the resources to purchase deploy learn and support our products quickly and easily we have a significant number of registered thirdparty developers who create products that work well with our products and extend them for a variety of specialized applications 

 autodesk is committed to helping fuel a lifelong passion for design in students of all ages we offer free educational subscriptions of autodesk software worldwide to students educators and educational institutions through autodesk design academy we provide secondary and postsecondary school markets hundreds of standardsaligned class projects to support designbased disciplines in science technology engineering digital arts and math steam while using autodesks professionalgrade 3d design engineering and entertainment software used in industry we also have made autodesk design academy curricula available on itunes u our intention is to make autodesk software ubiquitous and the design software of choice for those poised to become the next generation of professional users 

our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products technology and businesses acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers however they entail cost and integration challenges and may in certain instances negatively impact our operating margins we continually review these tradeoffs in making decisions regarding acquisitions we currently anticipate that we will continue to acquire products technology and businesses as compelling opportunities become available

our strategy depends upon a number of assumptions to successfully make the transition toward new cloud and mobile platforms including the related technology and business model shifts making our technology available to mainstream markets leveraging our large global network of distributors resellers thirdparty developers customers educational institutions and students improving the performance and functionality of our products and adequately protecting our intellectual property if the outcome of any of these assumptions differs from our expectations we may not be able to implement our strategy which could potentially adversely affect our business for further discussion regarding these and related risks see part i  item 1a  “ risk factors ” 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we regularly reevaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we believe that of all our significant accounting policies the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 

for multiple element arrangements containing only software and softwarerelated elements we allocate the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on our vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value vsoe is the price charged when an element is sold separately or a price set by management with the relevant authority if we do not have vsoe of an undelivered software license we defer revenue recognition on the entire sales arrangement until all elements for which we do not have vsoe are delivered if we do not have vsoe for undelivered product subscriptions maintenance or services the revenue for the arrangement is recognized over the longest contractual service period in the arrangement we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 

for multiple elements arrangements involving nonsoftware elements including cloud subscription services our revenue recognition policy is based upon the accounting guidance contained in accounting standards codification asc 605 revenue recognition  for these arrangements we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the nonsoftware elements we then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group using the residual method as described above we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of revenue to be recognized in each accounting period 

we allocate the total arrangement consideration among the various elements based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on its vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or the best estimated selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available besp represents the price at which autodesk would transact for the deliverable if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis to establish besp for those elements for which neither vsoe nor tpe are available we perform a quantitative analysis of pricing data points for historical standalone transactions involving such elements for a twelvemonth period as part of this analysis we monitor and evaluate the besp against actual pricing to ensure that it continues to represent a reasonable estimate of the standalone selling price considering several other external and internal factors including but not limited to pricing and discounting practices contractually stated prices the geographies in which we offer our products and services and the type of customer ie distributor valueadded reseller and direct end user among others we analyze besp at least annually or on a more frequent basis if a significant change in our business necessitates a more timely analysis or if we experience significant variances in our selling prices 

in situations when we have multiple contracts with a single counterparty we use the guidance in asc 985605 to evaluate both the form and the substance of the arrangements to determine if they should be combined and accounted for as one arrangement or as separate arrangements 

2017 form 10k 38 

table of contents 

our assessment of the likelihood of collection is also a critical factor in determining the timing of revenue recognition if we do not believe that collection is probable the revenue will be deferred until payment is received 

our indirect channel model includes both a twotiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a onetiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers our subscription revenue from distributors and resellers generally commences recognition at the time access is provided to their customers provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met this policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns among other criteria we are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

as part of the indirect channel model we have a partner incentive program that uses quarterly attainment of monetary rewards to motivate distributors and resellers to achieve mutually agreed upon business goals in a specified time period a portion of these incentives reduce license and other revenue in the current period the remainder which relates to incentives on our subscription program is recorded as a reduction to deferred revenue in the period the subscription transaction is billed and subsequently recognized as a reduction to subscription revenue over the contract period these incentive balances do not require significant assumptions or judgments depending on how the payments are made the reserves associated with the partner incentive program are treated on the balance sheet as either contra account receivable or accounts payable 

marketable securities and privately held company investments as described in note 2  “ financial instruments ” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements our investments in marketable securities are measured at the end of each reporting period and reported at fair value fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date in determining the fair value of our investments we are sometimes required to use various alternative valuation techniques inputs to valuation techniques are either observable or unobservable observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions these two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy 

 

 

 

this hierarchy requires us to minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to use observable market data if available when determining fair value this is generally true for our cash and cash equivalents and the majority of our marketable securities which we consider to be level 1 assets and level 2 assets however determining the fair value of marketable securities or convertible note investments in privately held companies when observable inputs are not available level 3 requires significant judgment for example we use probability weighted discounted cash flow models in which some of the inputs are unobservable in the market to estimate the fair value of our convertible debt securities these assumptions are inherently subjective and involve significant management judgment whenever possible we use observable market data and rely on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available when determining fair value 

all of autodesk’s marketable securities and privately held company investments are subject to a periodic impairment review we recognize an impairment charge when a decline in the fair value of its investments below the cost basis is judged to be otherthantemporary autodesk considers various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than autodesk’s cost basis the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the investee and autodesk’s intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value 

business combinations   we allocate the fair value of the consideration transferred to the assets and liabilities acquired as well as to inprocess research and development based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the purchase price allocation requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations 

2017 form 10k 39 

table of contents 

although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain examples of critical estimates used in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to 

 

 

 

 

these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and if such events occur we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities 

realizability of longlived assets we assess the realizability of our longlived assets and related intangible assets other than goodwill annually during the fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review significant underperformance of a business or product line relative to budget shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends and the results of past impairment reviews when such events or changes in circumstances occur we assess recoverability of these assets 

we assess   recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows we would perform a discounted cash flow analysis to assess impairments on longlived assets variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge impairment charges if any result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values 

in addition to our recoverability assessments we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our longlived assets any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made as well as in subsequent quarters 

we will continue to evaluate the values of our longlived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability approach under this method deferred tax assets including those related to tax loss carryforwards and credits and deferred tax liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we recognize the tax benefit for an uncertain tax position when it meets a more likely than not threshold we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense 

a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be recovered the valuation allowance is determined by assessing both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable such assessment is required on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis significant judgment is required in determining whether the valuation allowance should be recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we considered cumulative losses in the us arising from the company’s business model transition as a significant source of negative evidence considering this negative evidence and the absence of sufficient positive objective evidence that we would generate sufficient taxable income in the us to realize the deferred tax assets we determined that it was more likely than not 

2017 form 10k 40 

table of contents 

that the company would not realize us federal and state deferred tax assets and recorded a valuation allowance on our federal and state deferred tax assets we continue to have a full valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets in fiscal 2017 and increased the amount of the valuation allowance to include deferred tax assets generated in fiscal 2017 including deferred tax assets that were established as a result of the adoption of asu 20169 in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 

as we continually strive to optimize our overall business model tax planning strategies may become feasible and prudent whereby management may determine that it is more likely than not that the federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized therefore we will continue to evaluate the evidence around our ability to utilize our net deferred tax assets each quarter both in the us and in foreign jurisdictions based on all available evidence both positive and negative 

stockbased compensation  we measure stockbased compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award and recognize expense ratably over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period we estimate the fair value of certain stockbased payment awards including grants of employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan using either the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model or a binomiallattice model eg monte carlo simulation model to determine the grantdate fair value of our stockbased payment awards we use a blackscholes model or the quoted stock price on the date of grant unless the awards are subject to market conditions in which case we use the monte carlo simulation model the monte carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables to estimate the probability that market conditions will be achieved these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors the riskfree interest rate for the expected term of the award and expected dividends the variables used in these models are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted as needed sharebased compensation cost for restricted stock is measured on the closing fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

legal contingencies  as described in part i  item 3  “ legal proceedings ” and part ii  item 8  note 8  “ commitments and contingencies ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations 

restructuring charges and other facility exit costs net and accruals  in february 2016 the board of directors approved a worldwide restructuring plan “fiscal 2017 plan” in order to rebalance staffing levels and reduce operating expenses to better align them with the evolving needs of the companys business the company’s restructuring plans include one–time termination benefits as well as certain contractual termination benefits we record costs associated with exit activities related to restructuring plans in accordance with the asc topic 420 exit or disposal obligations  liabilities for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred the timing of associated cash payments is dependent upon the type of exit cost and may extend over a 12month period we record restructuring charge liabilities in “other accrued liabilities” or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 

restructuring charges include employee termination costs facility closure and relocation costs and contract termination costs one–time termination benefits are recognized as a liability at estimated fair value when the approved plan of termination has been communicated to employees unless employees must provide future service in which case the benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period ongoing termination benefits arrangements are recognized as a liability at estimated fair value when the amount of such benefits becomes estimable and payment is probable for the facility facilityrelated restructuring charges we recognize upon exiting all or a portion of a leased facility and meeting ceaseuse and other requirements the amount of restructuring charges is based on the fair value of the lease obligation for the abandoned space which includes a sublease assumption that could be reasonably obtained 

restructuring charges require significant estimates and assumptions including sublease income and expenses for severance and other employee separation costs our estimates involve a number of risks and uncertainties some of which are beyond our control including future real estate market conditions and our ability to successfully enter into subleases or termination agreements with terms as favorable as those assumed when arriving at our estimates we monitor these estimates and assumptions on at least a quarterly basis for changes in circumstances and any corresponding adjustments to the accrual are recorded in our statement of operations in the period when such changes are known

overview of fiscal 2017   



 

 

we are undergoing a business model transition in which we have discontinued selling new perpetual licenses for most of our products in favor of new model subscriptions during the transition revenue margins eps deferred revenue and cash flow from operations have been and will be impacted as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than upfront and as new product subscription offerings generally have a lower initial purchase price 

revenue analysis 

during fiscal 2017 net revenue decreased 19  as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to a 40  decrease in license and other revenue resulting from the discontinuation of the sale of most individual perpetual products as of february 1 2016 and of new perpetual licenses of suites effective august 1 2016 the decrease in license and other revenue was partially   offset by a 1  increase in subscription revenue driven by a 39  increase in revenue from our new model subscription offerings largely offset by a 3  decrease in maintenance revenue 

further discussion of the drivers of these results are discussed below under the heading “results from operations” 

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including tech data corporation and its global affiliates collectively “tech data” tech data accounted for 30  25  and 25  of our consolidated net revenue during fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively our customers through tech data are the resellers and end users who purchase our software licenses and services should any of the agreements between tech data and us be terminated for any reason we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue consequently we believe our business is not substantially dependent on tech data 

operating margin analysis 

income from operations decreased  in fiscal 2017  due to a 4731 million  decrease in revenue as discussed above and a 566 million  increase in our operating expenses as compared to fiscal 2016  our operating margin decreased to 25  for fiscal 2017  from 0  for fiscal 2016  the increase in operating expenses between fiscal 2017  and 2016  was driven by restructuring charges and other facility exit costs 

further discussion regarding the cost of revenue and operating expense activities are discussed below under the heading “results of operations” 

business model transition metrics 

in order to help better understand our financial performance during and after the transition we have introduced several new metrics including recurring revenue total subscriptions arr and annualized revenue per subscription arps arr 

2017 form 10k 42 

table of contents 

arps and recurring revenue are performance metrics and should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as arr and arps are not intended to be combined with those items please refer to the glossary of terms for further discussion regarding the new metric terminology 

recurring revenue represents  the revenue for the period from our maintenance plans and revenue from our new model subscription offerings including portions of revenue allocated to license and other revenue for those offerings it excludes subscription revenue related to education offerings consumer product offerings select creative finishing product offerings autodesk buzzsaw autodesk constructware and third party products recurring revenue acquired with the acquisition of a business is reported when total subscriptions are captured in our systems and may cause variability in the comparison of this calculation   

the following table outlines our recurring revenue for the fiscal year ended   2017  2016  and 2015  



 

 

during fiscal 2017  recurring revenue was 74  of total net revenue as compared to 54  and 46  of total net revenue for fiscal 2016  and 2015  respectively 

2017 form 10k 43 

table of contents 

the following table outlines our subscriptions arr and arps metrics as of fiscal years ended january 31 2017  and january 31 2016  

yearoveryear maintenance subscriptions decreased 6 as of january 31 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of the discontinuation of new perpetual license sales for most individual products at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and the end of perpetual suites at the end of second quarter of fiscal 2017 partially offset by the addition of approximately 14000 maintenance subscriptions associated with an acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 yearoveryear new model subscriptions increased 155 as of january 31 2017  as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily driven by growth in all new model subscription types led by product subscription new model subscriptions also benefited from a promotion aimed at converting legacy nonsubscribers which captured approximately 75000 additional product subscriptions 

total arr increased 16 as of january 31 2017 as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to a 107 increase in new model arr driven by growth in all new model subscription types led by product subscription arr growth was negatively impacted by 3 percentage points from the allocation of our market development funds mdf 

the 4  decrease in total arps was primarily due to a 19  decrease in new model arps the decline in new model arps is a result of individual product subscriptions leading the growth in new model subscriptions which are priced lower than our flexible enterprise business agreements and in turn decreases arps 

our arps is also declining because of various factors including mix foreign currency and the contrarevenue impact of mdf discussed above going forward the arps calculation will continue to be extremely sensitive to shortterm shifts in termlength geography mix and promotions we expect to see arps fluctuate up or down on a quarterly basis and we do not expect it will increase evenly throughout the year as we complete our business model transition we expect all of these impacts to start to stabilize 

foreign currency analysis 

we generate a significant amount of our revenue in the us germany japan the united kingdom and canada total net revenue for fiscal 2017  decreased 19  on an as reported basis compared to the prior fiscal year and was negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate changes during fiscal 2017  had applicable exchange rates from fiscal 2016  been in effect during fiscal 2017  and had we excluded foreign exchange hedge gains and losses from both fiscal 2016  and 2017  net revenue would have decreased   16  on a constant currency basis compared to the prior fiscal year 

our total spend defined as cost of revenue plus operating expenses during fiscal 2017   increased   1  on an as reported basis as compared to the prior fiscal year had applicable exchange rates from fiscal 2016  been in effect during fiscal 2017  and 

2017 form 10k 44 

table of contents 

had we excluded foreign exchange hedge gains and losses from both fiscal 2016  and 2017  total spend would have increased   3  on a constant currency basis compared to the prior fiscal year 

changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue total spend and income from operations in future periods we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on a portion of the net revenue and spend of certain anticipated transactions but do not attempt to completely mitigate the impact of fluctuations of such foreign currency against the us dollar 

balance sheet and cash flow items 

at january 31 2017  we had  22 billion  in cash and marketable securities we completed fiscal 2017  with higher deferred revenue and lower accounts receivable balances as compared to the prior fiscal year our deferred revenue balance at january 31 2017  was 18 billion  which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the life of the contracts the term of our subscription contracts is typically between one and three years our cash flow from operations decreased   59  to 1697 million  as of january 31 2017  from 4140 million  at january 31 2016  we repurchased 97 million  shares of our common stock for  6316 million  during fiscal 2017  comparatively we repurchased 85 million  shares of our common stock for  4580 million  during fiscal 2016  further discussion regarding the balance sheet and cash flow activities are discussed below under the heading “liquidity and capital resources”

fiscal 2017  net revenue compared to fiscal 2016  net revenue 

subscription revenue 

our subscription revenue consists of three components 1 maintenance plan revenue from our perpetual software products 2 maintenance revenue from our termbased product subscriptions and flexible enterprise business agreements and 3 revenue from our cloud service offerings   our maintenance plan provides our customers with a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of our new releases and enhancements when and if released during the term of their contracts under our maintenance plan customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades when and if available and online support we recognize maintenance plan revenue over the term of the agreements generally between one and three years  with the discontinuation of our perpetual license sales we no longer offer new maintenance subscriptions and expect our maintenance subscription revenue to decline over time our flexible enterprise business agreements are designed to give our customers increased flexibility with how they use our products and service offerings and to attract a broader range of customers such as projectbased users and small businesses we recognize maintenance revenue from these enterprise agreements ratably over their contract terms revenue for our cloud service offerings is recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date our service is made available to customers and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 

subscription revenue increased   1  during fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily due to a 39   increase  in new model subscription revenue partially offset by a 3   decrease  in maintenance plan revenue the 39   increase  in new model subscription revenue was primarily attributable to a 186   increase  in product subscription revenue and a 28   increase  in revenue from flexible enterprise business agreements the 3   decrease  in maintenance plan revenue was attributable to the business model transition as we expect maintenance plan revenue will slowly decline as perpetual license sales have ended and customers adopt our new model subscription offerings 

maintenance revenue from perpetual software products represented 86  and 90  of subscription revenue for the fiscal 2017  and 2016  respectively new model subscription revenue represented 14  and 10  of subscription revenue for the fiscal year ended january 31 2017  and 2016  respectively

license and other revenue 

license and other revenue consists of two components 1 all forms of product license revenue and 2 other revenue product license revenue includes software license revenue from the sale of perpetual licenses termbased licenses from our product subscriptions and flexible enterprise business agreements and product revenue for creative finishing other revenue includes revenue from consulting training autodesk developers network and creative finishing customer support and is recognized over time as the services are performed 

license and other revenue decreased   40  during fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  product license revenue as a percentage of license and other revenue was 82  and 88  for fiscal 2017  and 2016  respectively the decrease in product license revenue was due to the business model transition which led to a 63   decrease  in revenue from perpetual licenses as we have discontinued selling perpetual seats of most of our product offerings this decrease was partially offset by a 122   increase  in license revenue from our new model subscription offerings 

other revenue de creased by 7  during fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  other revenue represented 7  and 6  of total net revenue for fiscal 2017  and 2016  respectively 

there was no backlog at january 31 2017  compared to 314 million  at january 31 2016  due to the business model transition we do not expect material backlog in future periods 

net revenue by product family 

our product offerings are focused in four primary product families aec mfg autocad and autocad lt “acad” and me during the business model transition revenue has been and will be negatively impacted as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than upfront and as new product offerings generally have a lower initial purchase price as part of the transition we discontinued selling new perpetual licenses of most individual software products effective february 1 2016 and discontinued selling new perpetual licenses of suites effective august 1 2016 these broad impacts are reflected in the drivers below 

net revenue for aec product family decreased  by 7  during fiscal 2017  as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to 15 decrease in revenue from individual product offerings 

net revenue for mfg product family decreased  by 14  during fiscal 2017  as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to a 14 decrease in individual product offerings and a 13 decrease in our mfg suites 

net revenue for acad product family decreased  by 45  during fiscal 2017  as compared to the prior fiscal year as part of the transition to termbased product subscriptions for our individual software products in february 2016 products like autocad and acad lt are negatively impacted when compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year as revenue is recognized ratably rather than upfront 

net revenue for me product family decreased  by 13  during fiscal 2017  as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to a 50 decrease in creative finishing as we exited the creative finishing hardware business at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016

net revenue by geographic area 



net revenue in the americas geography decreased  by 10  on an as reported basis and on a constant currency basis during fiscal 2017  as compared to the prior fiscal year net revenue in the americas attributable to the united states was approximately 85  and 83  for fiscal 2017  and 2016  respectively 

international net revenue represented 63  and 68  of our net revenue for fiscal 2017  and 2016  respectively net revenue in the europe middle east and africa emea geography decreased  by 14  on an as reported basis and 8  on a constant currency basis during fiscal 2017  as compared to the prior fiscal year net revenue in the asia pacific apac geography decreased   40  on an as reported basis and 39  on a constant currency basis during fiscal 2017  as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of the business model transition and continued weakness in japan 

we believe that international revenue will continue to comprise a majority of our net revenue unfavorable economic conditions in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue including in emerging economies such as brazil russia india and china may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies have significantly affected and could continue to significantly affect our financial results for a given period even though we hedge a portion of our current and projected revenue weak global economic conditions that have been characterized by restructuring of sovereign debt high unemployment and volatility in the financial markets may impact our future financial results additionally during the business model transition revenue has been and will be negatively impacted as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than upfront and as new product offerings generally have a lower initial purchase price this transition has a particular impact to emerging economies as sales of perpetual licenses have historically comprised a greater percentage of total emerging economy sales in comparison to mature markets 

net revenue in emerging economies decreased   38  on an as reported basis and 37  on a constant currency basis during fiscal 2017  as compared to the prior fiscal year revenue from emerging economies represented 11  and 15  of total net revenue for fiscal 2017  and 2016  respectively

net revenue by product family

net revenue for the mfg product family increased by 7 during fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to a 78 increase in revenue from our delcam products as a result of including 12 months of delcam operating results during fiscal 2016 compared to 10 months during fiscal 2015 also contributing to the increase in net revenue for mfg during fiscal 2016 was a 12 increase in revenue from our flagship product autocad mechanical

interest and other expense net 

the following table sets forth the components of interest and other expense net 



interest and other expense net increased  26 million  during fiscal 2017  as compared to fiscal 2016  primarily related to a decrease in gains on certain of our privatelyheld strategic investments and an increase in losses on foreign currency this increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest and investments expense net that was primarily driven by mark to market gains on deferred compensation plans partially offset by an increase in interest expense resulting from the june 2015 issuance of  4500 million  aggregate principal amount of 3125  senior notes due june 15 2020  and  3000 million  aggregate principal amount of 4375  senior notes due june 15 2025  

interest and other expense net decreased  161 million  during fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  the decrease is primarily related to nonrecurring settlement gains on certain of our privatelyheld strategic investments and marktomark gains recognized on the derivative portion on certain of our other privatelyheld strategic investments during the current fiscal year comparatively we incurred nonrecurring impairment losses on certain of our privatelyheld strategic investments in the same periods in the prior fiscal year this decrease was offset by an increase in interest expense resulting from the june 2015 issuance of  4500 million  aggregate principal amount of 3125  senior notes due june 15 2020  and  3000 million  aggregate principal amount of 4375  senior notes due june 15 2025  

provision for income taxes 

we account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse 

income tax expense was 583 million  and 3102 million  for fiscal 2017  and 2016  respectively relative to a pretax loss of 5238 million  and pretax income of 203 million  respectively for the same periods tax expense for fiscal 2017 consists primarily of foreign tax expense including withholding tax and tax amortization on indefinitelived intangibles tax expense for fiscal 2016 related to foreign tax expense and the establishment of a 2308 million valuation allowance against the companys us federal and remaining state deferred tax assets recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in making that assessment we consider both positive and negative evidence whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance we considered recent cumulative losses in the us arising from our business model transition as a significant piece of negative evidence and determined that it was more likely than not that the federal and state deferred tax assets would not be realized 

income tax expense was 3102 million  and 12 million  for fiscal 2016  and 2015  respectively relative to pretax income of 203 million  and 830 million  respectively for the same periods our tax expense increased from fiscal 2015  to fiscal 2016  due to the establishment of a valuation allowance on our us federal and state deferred tax assets in fiscal 2016 recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 

our future effective annual tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate changes in valuation allowances level of profit before tax accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits and changes in tax laws including possible us tax law changes that if enacted could significantly impact how us multinational companies are taxed a significant amount of our earnings is generated by our europe and asia pacific subsidiaries our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower

than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates or we repatriate certain foreign earnings on which us taxes have not previously been provided 

at january 31 2017  we had noncurrent foreign net deferred tax assets of  497 million  that management believes are more likely than not to be realized in future years 

for additional information regarding our income tax provision and reconciliation of our effective rate to the federal statutory rate of 35 see note 4  “ income taxes ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

other financial information 

in addition to our results determined under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” discussed above we believe the following nongaap measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the fiscal years ended january 31 2017  2016  and 2015  our gross profit gross margin loss income from operations operating margin net loss income diluted net loss income per share and diluted shares used in per share calculation on a gaap and nongaap basis were as follows in millions except for gross margin operating margin and per share data 



  

 

 

for our internal budgeting and resource allocation process and as a means to provide consistency in periodtoperiod comparisons we use nongaap measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis these nongaap measures do not include certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results we also use nongaap measures in making operating decisions because we believe those measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our earning potential and performance for management by excluding certain benefits credits expenses and charges that may not be indicative of our core business operating results for the reasons set forth below we believe these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors both because 1 they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and 2 they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business this allows investors and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management compare financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the longterm performance of our core business we also use some of these measures for purposes of determining companywide incentive compensation 

there are limitations in using nongaap financial measures because nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies the nongaap financial measures included above are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results in addition they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by

management about which charges are excluded from the nongaap financial measures we compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a gaap basis as well as a nongaap basis and also by providing gaap measures in our public disclosures the presentation of nongaap financial information is meant to be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or in isolation from the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap we urge investors to review the reconciliation of our nongaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures included below and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business

our nongaap financial measures may exclude the following 

stockbased compensation expense s we exclude stockbased compensation expenses from nongaap measures primarily because they are noncash expenses and management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods moreover because of varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under fasb asc topic 718 we believe excluding stockbased compensation expenses allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies 

amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangibles we incur amortization of acquisitionrelated developed technology and purchased intangibles in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangibles is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions management finds it useful to exclude these variable charges from our cost of revenues to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangible assets will recur in future periods 

goodwill impairment this is a noncash charge to writedown goodwill to fair value when there was an indication that the asset was impaired as explained above management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

restructuring charges and other facility exit costs net these expenses are associated with realigning our business strategies based on current economic conditions in connection with these restructuring actions or other exit actions we recognize costs related to termination benefits for former employees whose positions were eliminated the closure of facilities and cancellation of certain contracts we exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing business and operating results we believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses 

loss gain on strategic investments  we exclude gains and losses related to our strategic investments from our nongaap measures primarily because management finds it useful to exclude these variable gains and losses on these investments in assessing our financial results included in these amounts are noncash unrealized gains and losses on the derivative components and realized gains and losses on the sale or losses on the impairment of these investments we believe excluding these items is useful to investors because these excluded items do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business and these losses or gains were incurred in connection with strategic investments which do not occur regularly 

establishment of a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets this is a noncash charge to record a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets as explained above management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various cash expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

discrete tax items  we exclude the gaap tax provision including discrete items from the nongaap measure of income and include a nongaap tax provision based upon the projected annual nongaap effective tax rate discrete tax items include income tax expenses or benefits that do not relate to ordinary income from continuing operations in the current fiscal year unusual or infrequently occurring items or the tax impact of certain stockbased compensation examples of discrete tax items include but are not limited to certain changes in judgment and changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years certain costs related to business combinations certain changes in the ability to utilize deferred tax assets or changes in tax law management believes this approach assists investors in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations we believe the exclusion of these discrete tax items provides investors with useful supplemental information about our operational performance 

income tax effects on the difference between gaap and nongaap costs and expenses  the income tax effects that are excluded from the nongaap measures relate to the tax impact on the difference between gaap and nongaap expenses primarily due to stockbased compensation amortization of purchased intangibles and restructuring charges and other facilities exit costs net for gaap and nongaap measures

our primary source of cash is from the sale and maintenance of our products our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employeerelated expenses such as compensation and benefits as well as general operating expenses for marketing facilities and overhead costs in addition to operating expenses we also use cash to fund our stock repurchase program and invest in our growth initiatives which include acquisitions of products technology and businesses see further discussion of these items below 

at january 31 2017  our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  22 billion  and net accounts receivable of  4523 million  net of our senior notes we have cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 07 billion  at january 31 2017

our cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally our primary commercial banking relationship is with citigroup and its global affiliates in addition citibank na an affiliate of citigroup is one of the lead lenders and agent in the syndicate of our  4000 million  line of credit 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased to  22 billion  at january 31 2017  from  28 billion  at january 31 2016  primarily as a result of cash used for repurchases of our common stock net of stock issuance proceeds acquisitions including business combinations and technology purchases and capital expenditures the decrease in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was partially offset by the cash generated through operations the cash proceeds from issuance of common stock vary based on our stock price stock option exercise activity and the volume of employee purchases under the employee stock purchase plan 

the primary source of net cash provided by operating activities of  1697 million  in fiscal 2017  was 3568 million  of cash flow provided by the change in operating assets and liabilities and 3222 million  of noncash expenses including stockbased compensation expense and depreciation amortization and accretion expense offsetting our net loss of 5821 million  the primary working capital sources of cash was an increase in deferred revenue and a decrease in accounts receivable for fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  the primary working capital use of cash was a decrease in other accrued liabilities for fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  our days sales outstanding in trade receivables was 86  at january 31 2017  compared to 92  at january 31 2016  the decrease in days sales outstanding primarily relates to changes in billings linearity within each comparative period 

at january 31 2017  our shortterm investment portfolio had an estimated fair value of  6868 million  and a cost basis of  6845 million  the portfolio fair value consisted of 2345 million  invested in corporate debt securities 1573 million  invested in certificates of deposit 1092 million  invested in commercial paper 434 million  invested in municipal securities 323 million  invested in us treasury bills 300 million  invested in sovereign debt 196 million  invested in asset backed securities and 132 million  invested in us government agency securities 

at january 31 2017  473 million  of trading securities were invested in a defined set of mutual funds as directed by the participants in our deferred compensation plan see note 6  “ deferred compensation ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

longterm cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following repayment of debt common stock repurchases the acquisition of businesses software products or technologies complementary to our business and capital expenditures including the purchase and implementation of internaluse software applications 

our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products technology and businesses acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers however they entail cost and integration challenges and in certain

instances negatively impact our operating margins we continually review these tradeoffs in making decisions regarding acquisitions we currently anticipate that we will continue to acquire products technology and businesses as compelling opportunities become available our decision to acquire businesses or technology is dependent on our business needs the availability of suitable sellers and technology and our own financial condition 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances are concentrated in a few locations around the world with substantial amounts held outside of the united states as of january 31 2017  approximately 91  of our total cash or cash equivalents and marketable securities are located in foreign jurisdictions and that percentage will fluctuate subject to business needs there are several factors that can impact our ability to utilize foreign cash balances such as foreign exchange restrictions foreign regulatory restrictions or adverse tax costs our intent is that amounts related to foreign earnings permanently reinvested outside the us will remain outside the united states we expect to meet our us liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows foreign cash for which us federal income taxes have been provided external borrowings or a combination we regularly review our capital structure and consider a variety of potential financing alternatives and planning strategies to ensure we have the proper liquidity available in the locations in which it is needed 

cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the risks detailed in part i item 1a  titled “ risk factors ” however based on our current business plan and revenue prospects we believe that our existing balances our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months 

our revenue earnings cash flows receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for which we have put in place foreign currency contracts as part of our risk management strategy see part ii item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees including limited product warranties historically costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant but because potential future costs are highly variable we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations 

issuer purchases of equity securities 

autodesks stock repurchase program provides autodesk with the ability to offset the dilution from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and reduce shares outstanding over time and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders under the share repurchase program autodesk may repurchase shares from time to time in open market transactions privatelynegotiated transactions accelerated share repurchase programs tender offers or by other means the share repurchase program does not have an expiration date and the pace and timing of repurchases will depend on factors such as cash generation from operations available surplus the volume of employee stock plan activity remaining shares available in the authorized pool cash requirements for acquisitions economic and market conditions stock price and legal and regulatory requirements 

in september 2016 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 300 million  shares of the companys common stock during the three and twelve months ended january 31 2017  we repurchased 29 million  and 97 million  shares of our common stock respectively at january 31 2017  266 million  shares remained available for repurchase under the repurchase programs approved by the board of directors these programs do not have a fixed expiration date see note 9  “ stockholders equity ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our revenue earnings cash flows receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency volatility that exists as part of our ongoing business operations we utilize cash flow hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions in addition we use balance sheet hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables and payables as of january 31 2017  and 2016  we had open cash flow and balance sheet hedge contracts with future settlements within one to twelve months contracts were primarily denominated in euros japanese yen swiss francs british pounds canadian dollars and australian dollars we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes the notional amount of our option and forward contracts was  6400 million  and  3740 million  at january 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 

we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue and operating expenses of certain anticipated transactions a sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january 31 2017  indicated that a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 31 2017  and 2016  would increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by 609 million  and 333 million  respectively a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the dollar from its value at january 31 2017  and 2016  would decrease the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by  325 million  and  256 million  respectively 

interest rate risk 

interest rate movements affect both the interest income we earn on our short term investments and the market value of certain longer term securities at january 31 2017  we had 18989 million  of cash equivalents and marketable securities including 6868 million  classified as shortterm marketable securities and 3062 million  classified as longterm marketable securities if interest rates were to move up by 50 or 100 basis points over a twelve month period the market value change of our marketable securities would have an unrealized gain or loss of 29 million  and 56 million  respectively 

other market risk 

from time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies privately held company investments generally are considered inherently risky the technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies see note 2   financial instruments  for further discussion regarding our privately held investments

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the exchange act our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the securities and exchange commission and ii accumulated and communicated to autodesk management including our cochief executive officers and chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our cochief executive officers and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k based upon this evaluation our cochief executive officers and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of january 31 2017  for reasons described below 

we have performed additional analyses and other procedures to enable management to conclude that notwithstanding the existence of the material weakness described above the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k present fairly in all material respects our financial position results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with gaap additionally corrective actions continue to address the internal control material weakness as described below under the section remediation efforts with respect to material weakness 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2017  in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in the 2013 internal control—integrated framework our management including our cochief executive officers and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within autodesk have been detected 

our management has concluded that as of january 31 2017  our internal control over financial reporting was not effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles due to the material weakness discussed in further detail below our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in item 8 herein 

in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended january 31 2017  our management concluded that it has a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the operating effectiveness of our controls over the calculation of income tax expense a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

remediation efforts with respect to material weakness 

management first identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting in connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended october 31 2015 since that time management’s remediation activities have included the following 

2017 form 10k 106 

table of contents 

 

 

 

 

management has enhanced its controls to include refinements and improvements to controls over the accounting for income taxes while significant progress has been made as of january 31 2017  management does not believe these controls are operating effectively as a result management does not believe that the material weakness has been remediated and will continue to enhance its controls over the accounting for income tax expense 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

other than with respect to the remediation efforts described above there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as such term is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 during the quarter ended january 31 2017  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware operating systems and software in addition our customers’ requirements and preferences rapidly evolve as do their expectations of the performance of our software to keep pace with these changes we maintain a vigorous program of new product development to address demands in the marketplace for our products 

the software industry is undergoing a transition from the personal computer to cloud social and mobile computing in fiscal 2016 we continued to successfully implement a strategic transition of our business model announced in fiscal 2014 we accelerated our move to the cloud and expanded our flexible product license offerings we continued to expand desktop subscription for a broader range of our product portfolio expanded our tokenbased licensing program to more enterprise customers and continued to expand our industryleading cloudbased offerings including the launch of our north american estore which creates a better customer experience and can meaningfully increase the volume of our online business these offerings are designed to give our customers even more value and flexibility to use our products and also to attract new types of customers such as projectbased users and small businesses that have more variable needs further to support our transition effective february 1 2016 we discontinued the sale of new commercial seats of most individual software products which are now exclusively available by desktop subscription and we plan to discontinue selling perpetual licenses of suites products effective august 1 2016 

we dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to further enhance our existing products and to create new products and technologies to expand our market opportunity for example in fiscal 2016 we began

marketing and sales 

we license or sell our products and services globally primarily through indirect channels consisting of distributors and resellers to a lesser extent we also transact directly with a select set of customers who are primarily large corporations our indirect channel model includes both a twotiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a onetiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers we have a network of approximately 2000  resellers and distributors worldwide for fiscal 2016  approximately 79  of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the future we anticipate that our channel mix will change to support our new business model and are proactively working with our channel partners to ensure a smooth transition we employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our reseller channel with our business strategies sales through our largest distributor tech data corporation and its affiliates accounted for 25  25  and 24  of our net revenue for fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively we believe our business is not substantially dependent on tech data our customers through tech data are the resellers and end users who purchase our software licenses and services should any of the agreements between us and tech data be terminated for any reason we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue no other distributor reseller or direct customer accounted for 10 or more of our revenue 

our customerrelated operations are divided into three geographic regions the americas europe middle east and africa “emea” and asia pacific “apac” each geographic region is supported by global marketing and sales organizations these organizations develop and manage overall marketing and sales programs and work closely with a network of domestic and international sales offices fiscal 2016  net revenue in the americas emea and apac was 9728 million   39  9346 million   37  and 5967 million   24  respectively we intend to continue to make our products available in foreign languages we believe that international sales will continue to comprise the majority of our total net revenue adverse economic conditions and currency exchange rates in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue including emerging economies may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance a summary of our financial information by geographic location is found in note 13  “ segments ” in the notes to consolidated

climate change 

autodesk recognizes inherent opportunities related to climate change which have potential to expand our business opportunities driven by changes in regulation changes in building code physical climate parameters and other climaterelated developments can directly and indirectly create more demand for existing and new autodesk products and services in the short and longterm opportunities relating to autodesk’s leadership on climate action can further improve our reputation in the marketplace 

climate change management actions 

to drive continued progress and meet growing demand we continue to expand the solutions education and support we offer helping customers secure a competitive advantage for a low carbon future by designing highperformance buildings resilient cities and infrastructure and more efficient transportation and products to continue to grow this market we provide software and support to early stage entrepreneurs and startup companies who are designing clean technologies we plan to expand these offerings in the future based upon demand and opportunity in response to challenges posed by climate change 

internally we are investing in best practices to mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions and climate change risk through investments in renewable energy energy efficiency disaster management and recovery strategies and materials innovation we are on track to meet our sciencebased greenhouse gas reduction target of 43 absolute emissions by 2020 

climate change governance 

ultimately our ceo carl bass has the highest level of direct responsibility for addressing our climatechange related risks and opportunities autodesk has established an environmental core team which reports indirectly to mr bass the environmental core team has direct responsibility for setting and implementing the corporate sustainability strategy including the climate change strategy 

emissions performance  other key performance indicators 

autodesk has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions for its operational boundary by 27 from our fiscal year 2009 baseline to 76700 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent this reduction was accomplished through increased investment in renewable energy leed certification and energy efficiency in our global real estate portfolio and continued transition from physical software delivery to cloud and electronic software delivery more information about our sustainability commitment can be found in our annual sustainability reports which we have published on our website since 2008 

philanthropy 

the autodesk foundation the foundation a privately funded 501c3 charity organization established and solely funded by us leads our philanthropic efforts the purpose of the foundation is twofold to support employees to create a better world at work at home and in the community by matching employee’s volunteer time andor donations to nonprofit organizations and to support organizations and individuals using design to drive positive social and environmental impact in the latter case we use grant funding software donations and training to accomplish this goal selecting the most impactful and innovative organizations around the world thus leading to a better future for our planet on our behalf the foundation also administers a discounted software donation program to nonprofit organizations social and environmental entrepreneurs and others who are developing design solutions that will shape a more sustainable future 

developer programs 

one of our key strategies is to maintain an openarchitecture design of our software products to facilitate thirdparty development of complementary products and industryspecific software solutions this approach enables customers and third parties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses we offer several programs that provide strategic investment funding technological platforms user communities technical support forums and events to developers who develop addon applications for our products for example we have established the autodesk spark program to support ideas that push the boundaries of 3d printing and nurture the companies that will advance innovations within 3d printing hardware and software we have also created the autodesk forge program to support innovators that build solutions to facilitate the development of a single connected ecosystem for the future of how things are designed made and used through our programs over 4100  developers in the autodesk developer network create interoperable products that further enhance the range of integrated solutions available to our customers

competition 

the markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to rapid change we strive to increase our competitive separation by investing in research and development allowing us to bring new products to market and create exciting new versions of existing products that offer compelling efficiencies for our customers we also compete through investments in marketing and sales to more effectively reach new customers and better serve existing customers 

our competitors include large global publicly traded companies small geographically focused firms startup firms and solutions produced inhouse by their users our primary global competitors in the pseb aec and mfg segments include adobe systems incorporated ansys inc aveva group plc bentley systems incorporated dassault systèmes sa and its subsidiary dassault systèmes solidworks corp environmental systems research institute inc esri intergraph corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of hexagon ab msc software corporation nemetschek ag ptc 3d systems siemens plm and trimble navigation limited 

our me segment also competes with a wide range of different companies from large global publiclytraded companies to small private entities large organizations that produce products that compete in some or all of our markets include adobe systems incorporated apple inc avid technology inc sony corporation and technicolor among others the media and entertainment market is highly fragmented with complex interdependencies between many of the larger businesses as a result some of our competitors also own subsidiaries that are our customers or our partners in developing or bringing to market some of our solutions in addition to traditional competitors in developed economies we encounter new competitors in emerging economies 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing power with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the industry is presently undergoing a platform shift from the personal computer to cloud and mobile computing this shift further lowers barriers to entry and poses a disruptive challenge to established software companies the design software market is characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete both from existing competitors and by entry of new competitors with innovative technologies competition is increasingly enhanced by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies and the possibility that competitors in one vertical segment may enter other vertical segments that we serve in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources than we do because of these and other factors competitive conditions in these industries are likely to continue to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which could harm our business see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion of risks regarding competition 

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to better serve customers by offering new products including cloud and mobile computing products whether by internal development or acquisition and to continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to ease of use reliability performance range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation price and training 

intellectual property and licenses 

we maintain an active program to legally protect our investment in technology through intellectual property rights we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions the nature and extent of legal protection associated with each such intellectual property right depends on among other things the type of intellectual property right and the given jurisdiction in which such right arises we believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business including each of our segments 

nonetheless our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws and enforcement of the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws enforcement of intellectual property rights against alleged infringers can sometimes lead to costly litigation and counterclaims our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business 

2016 form 10k 12 

table of contents 

from time to time we receive claims alleging infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights including patents disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to among other things costly litigation or product shipment delays which could harm our business 

we retain ownership of software we develop desktop software is licensed to users pursuant to ‘click through’ or signed license agreements containing restrictions on duplication disclosure and transfer cloud software and associated services are provided to users pursuant to online or signed terms of service agreements containing restrictions on access and use 

we believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our intellectual property and the rapid ongoing technological changes in both the computer hardware and software industries we must rely principally upon software engineering and marketing skills to continually maintain and enhance our competitive market position 

while we have recovered some revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the full extent to which piracy of our software products exists we believe however that software piracy is and can be expected to be a persistent problem that negatively impacts our revenue and financial results we believe that our transition from perpetual use software licenses to a subscriptionbased business model combined with the change from desktop to cloudbased computing will shift the incentives and means by which software is pirated 

in addition through various licensing arrangements we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others we expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing arrangements in the future as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions to support continued development and sales of our products and services some of these licensing arrangements require or may require royalty payments and other licensing fees the amount of these payments and fees may depend on various factors including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments offsetting considerations if any and the degree of use of the licensed technology 

see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion of risks related to protecting our intellectual property 

production and suppliers 

the production of our aec mfg pseb and certain me software products and services involves duplication or hosting of software media as we progress through our business model transition the way that we deliver software has evolved for certain cloudbased products we use a combination of colocated hosting facilities as well as infrastructureasaservice providers like amazon web services for other products we offer customers an electronic software download option for both initial product fulfillment as well as product updates for maintenance subscribers customers who choose electronic fulfillment receive the latest version of the software from our vendor’s secure servers customers may also obtain our software through media such as dvds and usb flash drives available from multiple sources the purchase of media and the transfer of the software programs onto media for distribution to customers are performed by us and by licensed subcontractors packaging materials are produced to our specifications by outside sources production is performed in leased facilities operated by independent thirdparty contractors to date we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the production of our software and documentation 

employees 

as of january 31 2016  we employed approximately 9500  people none of our employees in the united states are represented by a labor union in certain foreign countries our employees are represented by work councils we have never experienced any work stoppages and believe our employee relations are good reliance upon employees in other countries entails various risks and changes in these foreign countries such as government instability or regulation unfavorable to foreignowned businesses which could negatively impact our business in the future in february 2016 we announced a restructuring plan that will result in the termination of approximately 10 of the company’s workforce or approximately 925 employees in fiscal 2017 through the restructuring we seek to reduce expenses streamline the organization and reallocate resources to align more closely with the company’s needs going forward

acquisitions 

over the past three years we acquired new technology or supplemented our technology by purchasing businesses or technology related assets focused in specific markets or industries for the fiscal years ended january 31 2016  2015  and 2014  we acquired a number of companies and technology related assets some of which were accounted for as business combinations the following were key acquisitions for fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  



backlog 

we typically ship products shortly after receipt of an order which is common in the software industry our backlog consists of current software license product orders which have not yet shipped the category of current software license product orders which we have not yet shipped consists of orders from customers with approved credit status for currently available software products 

backlog was 314 million  at january 31 2016  compared to 404 million  at january 31 2015  the actual amount of backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects as this amount is impacted by a number of factors not related to future trends or events such as the order fulfillment process the method of software delivery or the linearity of our business within the fiscal period

risk factors 

tableend   

we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks a number of which are beyond our control in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following discussion highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on our business financial condition and future results of operations if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted causing the trading price of our common stock to decline in addition these risks and uncertainties may impact the “forwardlooking” statements described elsewhere in this form 10k and in the documents incorporated herein by reference they could affect our actual results of operations causing them to differ materially from those expressed in “forwardlooking” statements 

global economic and political conditions may further impact our business financial results and financial condition 

as our business has expanded globally we have increasingly become subject to risks arising from adverse changes in global economic and political conditions the past several years were characterized by weak global economic conditions volatile credit markets volatile exchange rates relatively high unemployment increased government deficit spending and debt levels uncertainty about certain governments abilities to repay such debt or to address certain fiscal issues and volatility in many financial instrument markets if economic growth in countries where we do business slows such as in japan or in emerging economies or if such countries experience further economic recessions customers may delay or reduce technology purchases this could result in reductions in sales of our products and services longer sales cycles and slower adoption of our technologies 

over the past several years many of our customers have experienced tighter credit negative financial news and weaker financial performance of their businesses and have reduced their workforces thereby reducing the number of licenses and the number of maintenance contracts they purchase from us in addition a number of our customers rely directly and indirectly on government spending current debt balances of many countries without proportionate increases in revenues have caused many countries to reduce spending and in some cases have forced those countries to restructure their debt in an effort to avoid defaulting under those obligations this has not only impacted those countries but others that are holders of such debt and those assisting in such restructuring 

these actions may impact and over the past several years have negatively impacted our business financial results and financial condition moreover our financial performance may be negatively impacted by 

 

 

 

 

 

uncertainty about current and future economic and political conditions on us our customers and partners makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments 

further macroeconomic degradation a slower economic recovery in industries important to our business or adverse exchange rate movements may adversely affect our business financial results and financial condition 

if we fail to successfully manage our business model transition to cloudbased products and more flexible product licenses our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

to address the industry transition from personal computer to cloud mobile and social computing we have accelerated our move to the cloud and are offering more flexible product licenses to support our transition we discontinued licensing upgrades effective march 6 2015 discontinued selling new perpetual licenses of most individual software products effective february 1 2016 and plan to discontinue selling new perpetual licenses of suites effective

august 1 2016   as a result we expect to derive an increasing portion of our revenues in the future from subscriptions this subscription model prices and delivers our products in a way that differs from the historical perpetual pricing and delivery methods these changes reflect a significant shift from perpetual license sales and distribution of our software in favor of providing our customers the right to access certain of our software in a hosted environment or use downloaded software for a specified subscription period during our transition revenue billings gross margin operating margin net income loss earnings loss per share deferred revenue and cash flow from operations will be impacted as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than up front and as new offerings bring a wider variety of price points 

our ability to achieve our financial objectives is subject to risks and uncertainties the new offerings require a considerable investment of technical financial legal and sales resources and a scalable organization market acceptance of such offerings is affected by a variety of factors including but not limited to security reliability performance current license terms customer preference socialcommunity engagement customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage their data public concerns regarding privacy and the enactment of restrictive laws or regulations whether our business model transition will prove successful and will accomplish our business and financial objectives is subject to numerous uncertainties including but not limited to customer demand attach and renewal rates channel acceptance our ability to further develop and scale infrastructure our ability to include functionality and usability in such offerings that address customer requirements tax and accounting implications pricing and our costs in addition the metrics we use to gauge the status of our business model transition may evolve over the course of the transition as significant trends emerge if we are unable to successfully establish these new offerings and navigate our business model transition in light of the foregoing risks and uncertainties our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

our strategy to develop and introduce new products and services exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance costs related to product defects and large expenditures each of which may not result in additional net revenue or could result in decreased net revenue 

rapid technological changes as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences characterize the software industry just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry 30 years ago we believe our industry is undergoing a similar transition from the personal computer to cloud mobile and social computing customers are also reconsidering the manner in which they license software products which requires us to constantly evaluate our business model and strategy in response we are focused on providing solutions to enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative on their projects we are also developing consumer products for digital art personal design and creativity and home design we devote significant resources to the development of new technologies in addition we frequently introduce new business models or methods that require a considerable investment of technical and financial resources such as our introduction of flexible license and service offerings it is uncertain whether these strategies will prove successful or whether we will be able to develop the necessary infrastructure and business models more quickly than our competitors we are making such investments through further development and enhancement of our existing products and services as well as through acquisitions of new product lines such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs and could result in decreased net revenue if we are not able to meet customer requirements either with respect to our software or hardware products or the manner in which we provide such products or if we are not able to adapt our business model to meet our customers requirements our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted 

in particular a critical component of our growth strategy is to have customers of our autocad and autocad lt products expand their portfolios to include our other offerings and cloudbased services we want customers using individual autodesk products to expand their portfolio with our other offerings and cloudbased services and we are taking steps to accelerate this migration at times sales of licenses of our autocad and autocad lt or individual autodesk flagship products have decreased without a corresponding increase in suites product or cloudbased services revenue or without purchases of customer seats to our suites should this continue our results of operations will be adversely affected also adoption of our cloud and mobile computing offerings and changes in the delivery of our software and services to our customers such as desktop subscription formally referred to as rental offerings will change the way in which we recognize revenue relating to our software and services with a potential negative impact on our financial performance the accounting impact of these offerings and other business decisions are expected to result in an increase in the percentage of our ratable revenue as well as recurring revenue making for a more predictable business over time while potentially reducing our upfront perpetual revenue stream 

our executive management team must act quickly continuously and with vision given the rapidly changing customer expectations and technology advancements inherent in the software industry the extensive and complex efforts required to create useful and widely accepted products and the rapid evolution of cloud computing mobile devices new computing platforms and other technologies such as consumer products although we have articulated a strategy that we 

2016 form 10k 17 

table of contents 

believe will fulfill these challenges if we fail to execute properly on that strategy or adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve we may fail to meet our customers expectations fail to compete with our competitors products and technology and lose the confidence of our channel partners and employees this in turn could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our entry into 3d printing presents many of the risks described above concerning developing and introducing new products as well as new risks for us the manufacturing and 3d printing markets are highly competitive and some of our competitors have superior experience and resources to us we have limited experience designing developing and selling hardware products and no experience developing and selling printers the market for 3d printing is nascent and may not develop as rapidly as we expect our sale of 3d printers could subject us to product and other liability that we do not currently face if any of these risks materialize it could adversely affect our business and financial performance as well as our reputation and brand 

revenue from our offerings may be difficult to predict during our business model transition 

the discontinuance of our perpetual licenses for most individual software products on february 1 2016 and for perpetual suites on august 1 2016 will result in the loss of future upfront licensing revenue this also will freeze growth of our maintenance subscription revenue because there will be no further opportunities to attach maintenance licensing once we cease the sale of suites licenses we expect our maintenance subscription revenue to decline over time but it may decline more quickly than anticipated due to low maintenance renewals at the same time our new model subscription revenue may not grow as rapidly as anticipated our new model subscription pricing allows customers to use our offerings at a lower initial cost when compared to the sale of a perpetual license although our new model subscriptions are designed to increase the number of customers who purchase offerings and create a recurring revenue stream that is more predictable over time it creates risks related to the timing of revenue recognition and expected reductions in cash flows in the near term 

we may not be able to predict subscription renewal rates and their impact on our future revenue and operating results 

our customers are not obligated to renew their subscriptions for our offerings and they may elect not to renew we cannot assure renewal rates or the mix of subscriptions renewals customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate due to a number of factors including offering pricing competitive offerings customer satisfaction and reductions in customer spending levels or customer activity due economic downturns or financial markets uncertainty if our customers do not renew their subscriptions or if they renew on less favorable terms our revenues may decline 

actions that we are taking to restructure our business in alignment with our business model transition strategy may be costly and may not be as effective as anticipated 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we commenced a companywide restructuring plan to accelerate the company’s move to the cloud and its transition to a subscriptionbased business model through the restructuring we seek to reduce expenses streamline the organization and reallocate resources to align more closely with the company’s needs going forward as a result of these actions we have incurred and will incur additional costs in the short term that have the effect of reducing our operating margins if we are unable to realize the expected outcomes from the restructuring efforts our business and operating results may be harmed 

our software is highly complex and may contain undetected errors defects or vulnerabilities each of which could harm our business and financial performance 

the software products that we offer are complex and despite extensive testing and quality control may contain errors defects or vulnerabilities some errors defects and vulnerabilities in our software products may only be discovered after the product or service has been released any errors defects or vulnerabilities could result in the need for corrective releases to our software products damage to our reputation loss of revenue an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products any of which would likely harm our business and financial performance

we are dependent on international revenue and operations exposing us to significant regulatory global economic intellectual property collections currency exchange rate taxation political instability and other risks which could adversely impact our financial results 

we are dependent on our international operations for a significant portion of our revenue international net revenue represented 68  and 71  of our net revenue in fiscal 2016  and 2015  respectively our international revenue including that from emerging economies is subject to general economic and political conditions in foreign markets including conditions in foreign markets resulting from economic and political conditions in the us our revenue is also impacted by the relative geographical and country mix of our revenue over time at times these factors adversely impact our international revenue and consequently our business as a whole our dependency on international revenue makes us much more exposed to global economic and political trends which can negatively impact our financial results even if our results in the us are strong for a particular period further a significant portion of our earnings from our international operations may not be freely transferable to the us due to remittance restrictions adverse tax consequences or other factors our intent is that amounts related to foreign earnings permanently reinvested outside the us will remain outside the us and we will meet our us liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings such as our 2012 and 2015 notes or both however if in the future amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are needed to fund our operations in the us or to service our external borrowings the repatriation of such amounts to the us could result in a significant incremental tax liability in the period in which the decision to repatriate occurs and payment of any such tax liability would reduce the cash available to fund our operations 

we anticipate that our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue and as we expand our international development sales and marketing expertise will provide significant support to our overall efforts in countries outside of the us risks inherent in our international operations include

some of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks 

existing and increased competition and rapidly evolving technological changes may reduce our revenue and profits 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing devices with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the industry is presently undergoing a platform shift from the personal computer to cloud and mobile computing this shift further lowers barriers to entry and poses a disruptive challenge to established software companies the markets in which we compete are characterized by vigorous competition both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources furthermore a reduction in the number and availability of compatible thirdparty applications or our inability to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes including those related to cloud computing mobile devices and new computing platforms may adversely affect the sale of our products because of these and other factors competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which would likely harm our business 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the us and we make certain business and resource decisions based on assumptions about foreign currency we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 

we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our cash flow exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as part of our risk management strategy we use foreign currency contracts to manage a portion of our exposures of underlying assets liabilities and other obligations which exist as part of our ongoing business operations these foreign currency instruments have maturities that extend for one to twelve months in the future and provide us with some protection against currency exposures however our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be completely successful resulting in an adverse impact on our financial results 

the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period although our foreign currency cash flow hedge program extends beyond the current quarter in order to reduce our exposure to foreign currency volatility we do not attempt to completely mitigate this risk and in any case will incur transaction fees in adopting such hedging programs such volatility even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings 

a breach of security in our products services or computer systems may compromise the integrity of our products or services harm our reputation create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results 

we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our source code and computer systems the risk of a security breach or disruption particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyber terrorists has increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased these threats include but are not limited to identity theft unauthorized access dns attacks wireless network attacks viruses and worms advanced persistent threat apt application centric attacks peertopeer attacks phishing backdoor trojans and distributed denial of service ddos attacks any of the foregoing could attack our products services or computer systems despite significant efforts to create

security barriers to such programs it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk like all software our software is vulnerable to cyber attacks in the past hackers have targeted our software and they may do so in the future the impact of cyber attacks could disrupt the proper functioning of our software products or services cause errors in the output of our customers work allow unauthorized access to sensitive proprietary or confidential information of ours or our customers and other destructive outcomes moreover as we continue to invest in new lines of consumer products and services we are exposed to increased security risks and the potential for unauthorized access to or improper use of the information of our consumer users if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation may suffer customers may stop buying our products or services we could face lawsuits and potential liability and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

changes in laws or regulations related to the internet local data storage or related to privacy and data security concerns may impact our business or expose us to increased liability 

the future success of our business depends upon the continued use of the internet as a primary medium for commerce communication and business applications federal state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws or regulations affecting data privacy and the transmission of certain types of content using the internet for example the state of california has adopted legislation requiring operators of commercial websites and mobile applications that collect personal information from california residents to conspicuously post and comply with privacy policies that satisfy certain requirements several other us states have adopted legislation requiring companies to protect the security of personal information that they collect from consumers over the internet and more states may adopt similar legislation in the future additionally the federal trade commission has used its authority under section 5 of the federal trade commission act to bring actions against companies for failing to maintain adequate security for personal information collected from consumers over the internet and for failing to comply with privacyrelated representations made to internet users the us congress has at various times proposed federal legislation intended to protect the privacy of internet users and the security of personal information collected from internet users that would impose additional compliance burdens upon companies collecting personal information from internet users and the us congress may adopt such legislation in the future the european union also has adopted various directives regulating data privacy and security and the transmission of content using the internet involving residents of the european union including those directives known as the data protection directive the eprivacy directive and the privacy and electronic communications directive and may adopt similar directives in the future other countries including canada and several latin american and asian countries have constitutional protections for or have adopted legislation protecting individuals personal information additionally some federal state or foreign governmental bodies have established laws that seek to censor the transmission of certain types of content over the internet or require that individuals be provided with the ability to permanently delete all electronic personal information such as the german multimedia law of 1997 and the california “eraser law” for minors additionally some foreign governmental bodies such as russia and china have established laws or have proposed laws that seek to require local data storage 

in addition new laws and industry selfregulatory codes have been enacted and more are being considered that may affect our ability to reach current and prospective customers to understand how our products and services are being used to respond to customer requests allowed under the laws and to implement our new business models effectively these new laws and regulations would similarly affect our competitors as well as our customers 

given the variety of global privacy and data protection regimes it is possible we may find ourselves subject to inconsistent obligations for instance the usa patriot act is considered by some to be in conflict with certain directives of the european union situations such as these require that we make prospective determinations regarding compliance with conflicting regulations increased enforcement of existing laws and regulations as well as any laws regulations or changes that may be adopted or implemented in the future could limit the growth of the use of public cloud applications or communications generally result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internetbased applications and require us to implement of additional technological safeguards 

in addition in october 2015 the european court of justice issued a ruling immediately invalidating the useu safe harbor framework which facilitated personal data transfers to the us in compliance with applicable eu data protection laws in february of 2016 the european commission and the united states agreed on a new framework for transatlantic data flows the euus privacy shield autodesk is currently awaiting additional guidance from european regulators on how the euus privacy shield will be implemented we continue to comply with the previous safe harbor principles and rely on other legal mechanisms for data transfers

increasing regulatory focus on privacy issues could impact our new business models and expose us to increased liability 

governments privacy advocates and class action attorneys are increasingly scrutinizing how companies collect process use store share or transmit personal data any perception of our practices or products as an invasion of privacy whether or not consistent with current regulations and industry practices may subject us to public criticism class action lawsuits reputational harm or claims by regulators industry groups or other third parties all of which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability 

we rely on thirdparties to provide us with a number of operational services including hosting and delivery and certain of our customer services and other operations and processing of data any interruption or delay in service from these third parties breaches of security or privacy could expose us to liability harm our reputation and adversely impact our financial performance 

we rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide our customers and computer operations for our internal use as we gather customer data and host certain customer data in thirdparty facilities a security breach could compromise the integrity or availability or result in the theft of customer data in addition our operations could be negatively affected in the event of a security breach and we could be subject to the loss or theft of confidential or proprietary information including source code 

unauthorized access to this data may be obtained through breakins breaches of our secure networks by unauthorized parties employee theft or misuse or other misconduct we rely on a number of third party suppliers in the operation of our business for the provision of various services and materials that we use in the operation of our business and production of our products we may from time to time rely on a single or limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country for these services or materials the inability of such third parties to satisfy our requirements could disrupt our business operations or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy if any of these situations were to occur our reputation could be harmed we could be subject to third party liability including under data protection and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

if we do not maintain good relationships with the members of our distribution channel or achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected if our distribution channel suffers financial losses becomes financially unstable or insolvent or is not provided the right mix of incentives to sell our products our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected 

we sell our software products both directly to endusers and through a network of distributors and resellers for fiscal 2016  and fiscal 2015  approximately 79  and 83  of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the future our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller network computer software distributors and resellers typically are not highly capitalized have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and experienced difficulties during the past several years we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of distributors and resellers prior to our sales to them in the past we have taken steps to support them and may take additional steps in the future such as extending credit terms and providing temporary discounts these steps if taken could harm our financial results if our distributors and resellers were to become insolvent they would not be able to maintain their business and sales or provide customer support services which would negatively impact our business and revenue 

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including the distributor tech data corporation and its global affiliates “tech data” tech data accounted for 25   of our total net revenue for both fiscal 2016  and 2015  respectively although we believe that we are not substantially dependent on tech data if tech data were to experience a significant disruption with its business or if our relationship with tech data were to significantly deteriorate it is possible that our ability to sell to end users would be at least temporarily negatively impacted this could in turn negatively impact our financial results 

over time we have modified and will continue to modify aspects of our relationship with our distributors and resellers such as their incentive programs pricing to them and our distribution model to motivate and reward them for aligning their businesses with our strategy and business objectives changes in these relationships and underlying programs could negatively impact their business and harm our business in addition the loss of or a significant reduction in business with those distributors or resellers or the failure to achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough with any one of our major international distributors or large resellers could harm our business in particular if one or more of such

distributors or resellers were unable to meet their obligations with respect to accounts payable to us we could be forced to write off such accounts and may be required to delay the recognition of revenue on future sales to these customers these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

a significant portion of our revenue is generated through maintenance revenue decreases in maintenance renewal rates would negatively impact our future revenue and financial results 

our maintenance customers have no obligation to attach maintenance to their initial license or renew their maintenance contract after the expiration of their initial maintenance period which is typically one year the discontinuance of our perpetual licenses for most individual software products on february 1 2016 and for perpetual suites on august 1 2016 will result in the loss of future maintenance attach opportunities and freeze maintenance growth once we discontinue new perpetual suites we expect customers renewal rates will decline or fluctuate over time as a result of a number of factors including the overall global economy the health of their businesses and the perceived value of the maintenance program if our customers do not renew their maintenance contract for our products our maintenance revenue will decline and our financial results will suffer 

we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the term of the maintenance contracts which is predominantly one year but may also range up to five years decreases in maintenance billings will negatively impact future maintenance revenue however future maintenance revenue will also be impacted by other factors such as the amount timing and mix of contract terms of future billings 

our financial results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenue and financial results difficult to predict 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so in the future these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines we also provide investors with quarterly and annual financial forwardlooking guidance that could prove to be inaccurate as a result of these fluctuations in addition to the other factors described in this part i item 1a some of the factors that could cause our financial results to fluctuate include

we have also experienced fluctuations in financial results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic or political conditions in particular our financial results in europe during our third quarter are usually affected by a slower summer period and our asia pacific operations typically experience seasonal slowing in our third and fourth quarters

our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenue and are relatively fixed in the short term accordingly any revenue shortfall below expectations has had and in the future could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability greater than anticipated expenses or a failure to maintain rigorous cost controls would also negatively affect profitability 

our business could suffer as a result of risks costs charges and integration risks associated with strategic acquisitions and investments 

we regularly acquire or invest in businesses software products and technologies that are complementary to our business through acquisitions strategic alliances or equity or debt investments the risks associated with such acquisitions include among others the difficulty of assimilating products operations and personnel inheriting liabilities such as intellectual property infringement claims the failure to realize anticipated revenue and cost projections the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business in accordance with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the diversion of managements time and attention for example we face risks relating to our fiscal 2017 integration of our delcam subsidiaries which previously operated autonomously 

in addition such acquisitions and investments involve other risks such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may not be successful in overcoming such risks and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business in addition such acquisitions and investments have in the past and may in the future contribute to potential fluctuations in our quarterly financial results these fluctuations could arise from transactionrelated costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or writeoffs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments these costs or charges could negatively impact our financial results for a given period cause quarter to quarter variability in our financial results or negatively impact our financial results for several future periods 

because we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from a small number of products including our autocadbased software products and suites if these products are not successful our revenue will be adversely affected 

we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from sales of licenses of a limited number of our products including autocad software products based on autocad which include our suites that serve specific markets and products that are interoperable with autocad any factor adversely affecting sales of these products including the product release cycle market acceptance product competition performance and reliability reputation price competition economic and market conditions and the availability of thirdparty applications would likely harm our financial results during fiscal 2016  and 2015  combined revenue from our autocad and autocad lt products not including suites having autocad or autocad lt as a component represented 24   and 28   of our total net revenue respectively

if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights our business could be harmed 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright and trademark laws trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software products or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our software products is timeconsuming and costly we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists and we expect that software piracy will remain a persistent problem particularly in emerging economies furthermore our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 

additionally we actively protect the secrecy of our confidential information and trade secrets including our source code if unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code the loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for thirdparties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our financial performance and our reputation we also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of nondisclosure agreements with our customers contractors vendors and partners however it is possible that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization if this were to occur it may be difficult andor costly for us to enforce our rights and our financial performance and reputation could be negatively impacted 

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in the loss of significant rights 

as more software patents are granted worldwide the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims infringement or misappropriation claims have in the past been and may in the future be asserted against us and any such assertions could harm our business additionally certain patent holders without products have become more aggressive in threatening and pursuing litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents any such claims or threats whether with or without merit have been and could in the future be timeconsuming to defend result in costly litigation and diversion of resources cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in addition such royalty or license agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms if at all which would likely harm our business 

from time to time we realign or introduce new business and sales initiatives if we fail to successfully execute and manage these initiatives our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

as part of our effort to accommodate our customers needs and demands and the rapid evolution of technology we from time to time evolve our business and sales initiatives such as realigning our development and marketing organizations and expanding our portfolio of suites and our offering of software as a service and realigning our internal resources in an effort to improve efficiency we may take such actions without clear indications that they will prove successful and at times we have been met with shortterm challenges in the execution of such initiatives market acceptance of any new business or sales initiative is dependent on our ability to match our customers needs at the right time and price often we have limited prior experience and operating history in these new areas of emphasis if any of our assumptions about expenses revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated and our financial results will be negatively impacted 

if we fail to remediate the material weakness identified in our internal control over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future the accuracy and timeliness of our financial and operating reporting may be adversely affected and could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

in connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended october 31 2015 our management concluded that a material weakness exists in our internal control over financial reporting related to our controls over the technical review of our reconciliation of our deferred tax accounts and the effective tax rate a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis

management initiated remediation plans including the following 

 

 

 

 

there can be no assurance that our remedial measures will be sufficient to address the material weakness or that our internal control over financial reporting will not be subject to additional material weaknesses in the future if the remedial measures that we take are insufficient to address our material weakness or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future our condensed consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results additionally we may encounter problems or delays in implementing any changes necessary for management to make a favorable assessment of our internal control over financial reporting if we cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting investors could lose confidence in our financial reports and the price of our common stock could decline 

net revenue billings earnings or subscriptions shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline 

the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including the other factors described in this part i  item 1a  and the following

significant changes in the price of our common stock could expose us to costly and timeconsuming litigation historically after periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities a company becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts managements attention and resources 

our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our success and ability to invest and grow depend largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical professional managerial sales and marketing personnel historically competition for these key personnel has been intense the loss of services of any of our key personnel including key personnel joining our company through acquisitions the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions and financial goals 

our investment portfolio consists of a variety of investment vehicles in a number of countries that are subject to interest rate trends market volatility and other economic factors if general economic conditions decline this could cause the credit ratings of our investments to deteriorate illiquidity in the financial marketplace and we may experience a decline in interest income and an inability to sell our investments leading to impairment in the value of our investments 

it is our policy to invest our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in highly liquid instruments with and in the custody of financial institutions with high credit ratings and to limit the amounts invested with any one institution type of security and issuer however we are subject to general economic conditions interest rate trends and volatility in the financial marketplace that can affect the income that we receive from our investments the net realizable value of our investments including our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and our ability to sell them in the us for example the yields on our portfolio securities are very low due to general economic conditions any one of these factors could reduce our investment income or result in material charges which in turn could impact our overall net income loss and earnings loss per share 

from time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies privately held company investments are considered inherently risky the technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies 

a loss on any of our investments may cause us to record an otherthantemporary impairment charge the effect of this charge could impact our overall net income loss and earnings loss per share in any of these scenarios our liquidity may be negatively impacted which in turn may prohibit us from making investments in our business taking advantage of opportunities and potentially meeting our financial obligations as they come due 

we are subject to legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries and we may be named in additional legal proceedings or become involved in regulatory inquiries in the future all of which are costly distracting to our core business and could result in an unfavorable outcome or a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or the trading prices for our securities 

we are involved in legal proceedings and receive inquiries from regulatory agencies as the global economy has changed and our business has evolved we have seen an increase in litigation activity and regulatory inquiries like many other high technology companies the number and frequency of inquiries from us and foreign regulatory agencies we have received regarding our business and our business practices and the business practices of others in our industry have increased in recent years in the event that we are involved in significant disputes or are the subject of a formal action by a regulatory agency we could be exposed to costly and time consuming legal proceedings that could result in any number of outcomes any claims or regulatory actions initiated by or against us whether successful or not could result in expensive costs of defense costly damage awards injunctive relief increased costs of business fines or orders to change certain business practices significant dedication of management time diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business in any of these cases our financial results results of operations cash flows or the trading prices for our securities could be negatively impacted

changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business further such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective 

for example the usbased financial accounting standards board “fasb” is currently working together with the international accounting standards board “iasb” on several projects to further align accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies who are required to follow us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” under sec regulations and those who are required to follow international financial reporting standards ifrs outside of the us these efforts by the fasb and iasb may result in different accounting principles under gaap that may result in materially different financial results for us in areas including but not limited to principles for recognizing revenue and lease accounting 

it is not clear if or when these potential changes in accounting principles may become effective whether we have the proper systems and controls in place to accommodate such changes and the impact that any such changes may have on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows in addition as we evolve and change our business and sales models we are currently unable to determine how these potential changes may impact our new models particularly in the area of revenue recognition 

we are investing in resources to update and improve our information technology systems should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems disrupt our operations our business model transition could be compromised and our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network and data center infrastructure technology systems and our websites for our development marketing operational support sales accounting and financial reporting activities we continually invest resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet the growing and evolving requirements of our business and customers in particular our transition to cloudbased products and a subscription only business model requires considerable investment in the development of technologies and back office systems for technical financial compliance and sales resources to enable a scalable organization 

such improvements are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or uncover problems with our existing technology systems unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in disruption in our business operations loss of revenue errors in our accounting and financial reporting or damage to our reputation and compromise our business model transition 

in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements which if not accurate may significantly impact our financial results 

  

we make assumptions judgments and estimates for a number of items including the fair value of financial instruments goodwill longlived assets and other intangible assets the realizability of deferred tax assets and the fair value of stock awards we also make assumptions judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee related liabilities including commissions bonuses and sabbaticals and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions partner incentive programs product returns reserves allowances for doubtful accounts asset retirement obligations and legal contingencies these assumptions judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from our estimates and such differences could significantly impact our financial results 

our financial results could be negatively impacted if our tax positions are overturned by tax authorities 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions our effective tax rate is primarily based on our expected geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany transfer pricing and enacted tax rules significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis we believe our tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are 

2016 form 10k 29 

table of contents 

consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 

we rely on third party technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies our product and service development may be delayed and our financial results negatively impacted 

we rely on certain software that we license from third parties including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions these thirdparty software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and the software may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software can be developed identified licensed and integrated which would likely harm our business 

disruptions with licensing relationships and third party developers could adversely impact our business 

we license certain key technologies from third parties licenses may be restricted in the term or the use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business similarly we may not be able to obtain or renew license agreements for key technology on favorable terms if at all and any failure to do so could harm our business 

our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with thirdparty developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn in particular markets such disruptions have in the past and would likely in the future negatively impact these thirdparty developers and end users which could harm our business 

additionally technology created by outsourced product development whether outsourced to third parties or developed externally and transferred to us through business or technology acquisitions have certain additional risks such as effective integration into existing products adequate transfer of technology knowhow and ownership and protection of transferred intellectual property 

as a result of our strategy of partnering with other companies for product development our product delivery schedules could be adversely affected if we experience difficulties with our product development partners 

we partner with certain independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities we believe our partnering strategy allows us to among other things achieve efficiencies in developing new products and maintaining and enhancing existing product offerings our partnering strategy creates a dependency on such independent developers independent developers including those who currently develop products for us in the us and throughout the world may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future in addition use of development resources through consulting relationships particularly in nonus jurisdictions with developing legal systems may be adversely impacted by and expose us to risks relating to evolving employment export and intellectual property laws these risks could among other things expose our intellectual property to misappropriation and result in disruptions to product delivery schedules 

our business may be significantly disrupted upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event 

our business is highly automated and relies extensively on the availability of our network and data center infrastructure our internal technology systems and our websites we also rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide to our customers and computer operations for our internal use the failure of our systems or hosted computer services due to a catastrophic event such as an earthquake fire flood tsunami weather event telecommunications failure power failure cyber attack or war could adversely impact our business financial results and financial condition we have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems in order to reduce the potential impact of a catastrophic event however there can be no assurance that these plans and systems would enable us to return to normal business operations in addition any such event could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products this could in turn decrease that countrys or regions demand for our products thereby negatively impacting our financial results

if we were required to record an impairment charge related to the value of our longlived assets or an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets our results of operations would be adversely affected 

our longlived assets are tested for impairment if indicators of impairment exist if impairment testing shows that the carrying value of our longlived assets exceeds their estimated fair values we would be required to record a noncash impairment charge which would decrease the carrying value of our longlived assets as the case may be and our results of operations would be adversely affected our deferred tax assets include net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods each quarter we assess the need for a valuation allowance considering both positive and negative evidence to determine whether all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are not more likely than not to be realized and determined during our second quarter of fiscal 2016 that our us deferred tax assets were no longer more likely than not to be realized changes in the amount of the valuation allowance could result in a material noncash expense or benefit in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted and our results of operations could be materially affected we will continue to perform these tests and any future adjustments may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we issued  15 billion  aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes in debt offerings and have an existing  4000 million  revolving credit facility and expect to incur other debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

in december 2012 we issued 195 notes due december 15 2017 in an aggregate principal amount of  4000 million  and 36 notes due december 15 2022 in an aggregate principal amount of  3500 million  in june 2015 we issued 3125 notes due june 15 2020 in an aggregate principal amount of  4500 million  and 4375 notes due june 15 2025 in an aggregate principal amount of  3000 million  as the debt matures we will have to expend significant resources to either repay or refinance these notes if we decide to refinance the notes we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all both of which may adversely affect our financial condition 

we also have a  4000 million  revolving credit facility as of january 31 2016  we had no outstanding borrowings on the line of credit although we have no current plans to borrow under this credit facility we may use the proceeds of any future borrowing for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business our existing and future levels of indebtedness may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 

 

 

 

we are required to comply with the covenants set forth in our unsecured notes and revolving credit facility our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or lenders then subject to applicable cure periods any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities under certain circumstances if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility could increase downgrades in our credit ratings could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing

issuer purchases of equity securities 

autodesks stock repurchase program is largely to help offset the dilution from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and for such other purposes as may be in the interests of autodesk and its stockholders and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders the number of shares acquired and the timing of the purchases are based on several factors including general market and economic conditions the number of employee stock option exercises and restricted stock unit issuances the trading price of autodesk common stock cash on hand and available in the united states cash requirements for acquisitions and company defined trading windows during the three and twelve months ended january 31 2016  we repurchased 16 million  and 85 million  shares respectively of our common stock at january 31 2016  63 million  shares remained available for repurchase under the repurchase program approved by the board of directors this program does not have a fixed expiration date see note 9  “ stockholders equity ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

strategy 

autodesk’s vision is to help people imagine design and create a better world we do this by developing software and services for the world’s designers architects engineers digital artists professionals and nonprofessionals alike—the people who imagine design and create the worlds products buildings infrastructure films and games autodesk serves professional customers in three primary markets architecture engineering and construction manufacturing and digital media and entertainment 

our goal is to provide our customers with the world’s most innovative and engaging design software and services our product and services portfolio allows our customers to digitally visualize simulate and analyze their projects helping them to better understand the consequences of their design decisions save time money and resources and become more innovative 

autodesk was founded during the platform transition from mainframes and engineering workstations to personal computers we developed and sustained a compelling value proposition based upon desktop software for the personal computer just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry over 30 years ago we believe our industry is undergoing a similar transition from the personal computer to cloud mobile and social computing to address this transition we have accelerated our move to the cloud and mobile devices and are offering more flexible licensing for example autodesk bim 360 plm 360 fusion 360 and autocad360 pro some of our cloud based offerings provide tools including mobile and social capabilities to help streamline design collaboration and data management processes we believe that customer adoption of these new offerings will continue to grow as customers across a range of industries begin to take advantage of the scalable computing power and flexibility provided through these new services 

our strategy is to lead the industries we serve to cloud based technologies and business models this entails both a technological shift and a business model shift we now have termbased license offerings including desktop subscriptions for certain products and flexible enterprise offerings these offerings are designed to give our customers even more flexibility with how they use our products and service offerings and to address new types of customers such as projectbased users and small businesses as part of this transition we discontinued licensing upgrades effective march 6 2015 discontinued selling new

perpetual licenses of most individual software products effective february 1 2016 and plan to discontinue selling new perpetual licenses of suites effective august 1 2016 

with the discontinuation of the sale of most perpetual licenses we are accelerating our transition away from selling a hybrid of perpetual licenses and termbased offerings toward a single subscription model during the transition billings revenue gross margin operating margin earnings loss per share deferred revenue and cash flow from operations will be impacted as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than up front and as new offerings bring a wider variety of price points 

as we progress through the business model transition billings and reported revenue will become less relevant to measure the success of the business as perpetual license sales are discontinued in favor of subscription offerings which have considerably lower upfront prices annualized recurring revenue arr and subscription additions will better reflect business momentum and provide additional transparency into the transition to further analyze progress we will also disaggregate our growth in these metrics between the original maintenance subscription model maintenance and the new desktop cloud and mobile and enterprise flexible license agreements new model we expect maintenance subscriptions to peak as perpetual license sales end this year and we expect them to decline slowly over time 

another key element of our strategy is increasing our global penetration emerging economies such as brazil russia india and china represent a construction and manufacturing opportunity emerging economies face many of the challenges that our design technology can help address including infrastructure buildout and innovative design and manufacturing however conducting business in these countries presents significant challenges including economic volatility geopolitical risk local competition limited intellectual property protection poorly developed business infrastructure scarcity of talent software piracy and different purchase patterns as compared to the developed world we believe that our move to the new model increases the number of potential markets for autodesk by connecting all of the participants in the process of designing and making things we can sell new offerings into the construction and manufacturing spaces in fiscal 2016  revenue from emerging economies decreased   4  as compared to fiscal 2015  and represented 15  of our total net revenue for both fiscal 2016  and fiscal 2015  respectively 

today complex challenges such as globalization urbanization and sustainable design are driving our customers to new levels of performance and competitiveness and we are committed to helping them address those challenges and take advantage of new opportunities to achieve these goals we are capitalizing on two of our strongest competitive advantages our ability to bring advanced technology to mainstream markets and the breadth and depth of our product portfolio 

we bring powerful new design capabilities to volume markets our products are designed to be easytolearn and use and to provide customers with a low cost of deployment a low total cost of access to our software offerings and a rapid return on investment in addition our software architecture allows for extensibility and integration with other products the breadth of our technology and product line gives us a unique competitive advantage because it allows our customers to address a wide variety of problems in ways that transcend industry and disciplinary boundaries this is particularly important in helping our customers address the complex challenges mentioned above we also believe that our technological leadership and global brand recognition have positioned us well for longterm growth and industry leadership 

in addition to the competitive advantages afforded by our technology our large global network of distributors resellers thirdparty developers customers educational institutions educators and students is a key competitive advantage this network of partners and relationships provides us with a broad and deep reach into volume markets around the world our distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with the resources to purchase deploy learn and support our products quickly and easily we have a significant number of registered thirdparty developers who create products that work well with our products and extend them for a variety of specialized applications 

autodesk is committed to helping fuel a lifelong passion for design in students of all ages we offer free educational licenses of autodesk software worldwide to students educators and educational institutions in fiscal 2016 we initiated project ignite a free and open learning platform delivering a unique package of technology learning content and services created specifically for the classroom the project ignite learning platform additionally offers classroom bundles which include hardware such as 3d printers and electronics kits along with professional development and training services to help educators through autodesk design academy we provide secondary and postsecondary school markets hundreds of standardsaligned class projects to support designbased disciplines in science technology engineering digital arts and math steam while using autodesks professionalgrade 3d design engineering and entertainment software used in industry beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we have also made autodesk design academy curricula available on itunes u our intention is to make autodesk software ubiquitous and the design software of choice for those poised to become the next generation of professional users

our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products technology and businesses acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers however they entail cost and integration challenges and may in certain instances negatively impact our operating margins we continually review these tradeoffs in making decisions regarding acquisitions we currently anticipate that we will continue to acquire products technology and businesses as compelling opportunities become available 

our strategy depends upon a number of assumptions to successfully make the transition toward new cloud and mobile platforms including the related technology and business model shifts making our technology available to mainstream markets leveraging our large global network of distributors resellers thirdparty developers customers educational institutions and students improving the performance and functionality of our products and adequately protecting our intellectual property if the outcome of any of these assumptions differs from our expectations we may not be able to implement our strategy which could potentially adversely affect our business for further discussion regarding these and related risks see part i  item 1a  “ risk factors ” 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we regularly reevaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we believe that of all our significant accounting policies the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 

for multiple element arrangements containing only software and softwarerelated elements we allocate the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on our vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value vsoe is the price charged when an element is sold separately or a price set by management with the relevant authority if we do not have vsoe of an undelivered software license we defer revenue recognition on the entire sales arrangement until all elements for which we do not have vsoe are delivered if we do not have vsoe for undelivered maintenance or services the revenue for the arrangement is recognized over the longest contractual service period in the arrangement we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 

for multiple elements arrangements involving nonsoftware elements including cloud subscription services our revenue recognition policy is based upon the accounting guidance contained in asc 605 revenue recognition  for these arrangements we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the nonsoftware elements we then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group using the residual method as described above we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of revenue to be recognized in each accounting period 

we allocate the total arrangement consideration among the various elements based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on its vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or the best estimated selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available besp represents the price at which autodesk would transact for the deliverable if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis to establish besp for those elements for which neither vsoe nor tpe are available we perform a quantitative analysis of pricing data points for historical standalone transactions involving such elements for a twelvemonth period as part of this analysis we monitor and evaluate the besp against actual pricing to ensure that it continues to represent a reasonable estimate of the standalone selling price considering several other external and internal factors including but not limited to pricing and discounting practices contractually stated prices the geographies in which we offer our products and services and the type of customer ie distributor valueadded 

2016 form 10k 39 

table of contents 

reseller and direct end user among others we analyze besp at least annually or on a more frequent basis if a significant change in our business necessitates a more timely analysis or if we experience significant variances in our selling prices 

in situations when we have multiple contracts with a single counterparty we use the guidance in asc 985605 to evaluate both the form and the substance of the arrangements to determine if they should be combined and accounted for as one arrangement or as separate arrangements 

our assessment of the likelihood of collection is also a critical factor in determining the timing of revenue recognition if we do not believe that collection is probable the revenue will be deferred until the earlier of when collection is deemed probable or payment is received 

our indirect channel model includes both a twotiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a onetiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers our product license revenue from distributors and resellers are generally recognized at the time title to our product passes to the distributor in a twotiered structure or reseller in a onetiered structure provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met this policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns among other criteria we are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers our policy also presumes that we have no significant performance obligations in connection with the sale of our product licenses by our distributors and resellers to their customers if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

as part of the indirect channel model we have a partner incentive program that uses quarterly attainment of monetary rewards to motivate distributors and resellers to achieve mutually agreed upon business goals in a specified time period a portion of these incentives reduce license and other revenue in the current period the remainder which relates to incentives on our subscription program is recorded as a reduction to deferred revenue in the period the subscription transaction is billed and subsequently recognized as a reduction to subscription revenue over the contract period these incentive balances do not require significant assumptions or judgments the reserves associated with the partner incentive program are treated on the balance sheet as either contra account receivable when due to distributors and direct resellers or accounts payable when due to indirect resellers 

marketable securities as described in note 2  “ financial instruments ” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements our investments in marketable securities are measured at the end of each reporting period and reported at fair value fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date in determining the fair value of our investments we are sometimes required to use various alternative valuation techniques inputs to valuation techniques are either observable or unobservable observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions these two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy 

 

 

 

this hierarchy requires us to minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to use observable market data if available when determining fair value this is generally true for our cash and cash equivalents and the majority of our marketable securities which we consider to be level 1 assets and level 2 assets however determining the fair value of marketable securities when observable inputs are not available level 3 requires significant judgment for example we use probability weighted discounted cash flow models in which some of the inputs are unobservable in the market to estimate the fair value of our convertible debt securities these assumptions are inherently subjective and involve significant management judgment whenever possible we use observable market data and rely on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available when determining fair value 

2016 form 10k 40 

table of contents 

all of autodesk’s marketable securities are subject to a periodic impairment review we recognize an impairment charge when a decline in the fair value of its investments below the cost basis is judged to be otherthantemporary autodesk considers various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than autodesk’s cost basis the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the investee and autodesk’s intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value 

business combinations   we allocate the fair value of the consideration transferred to the assets and liabilities acquired as well as to inprocess research and development based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the purchase price allocation requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations 

although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain examples of critical estimates used in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to 

 

 

 

 

these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and if such events occur we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities 

goodwill when we acquire a business a portion of the consideration transferred is typically allocated to acquired technology and other identifiable intangible assets such as customer relationships and developed technology the excess of the consideration transferred over the net of the acquisitiondate fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill the amounts allocated to acquired technology and other intangible assets represent our estimates of their fair values at the acquisition date we amortize the acquired technology and other intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives the estimation of acquisitiondate fair values of intangible assets and their useful lives requires us to make assumptions and judgments including but not limited to an evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as they relate to our business industry and market trends projections of future cash flows and appropriate discount rates 

we test goodwill for impairment annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment an optional assessment of qualitative factors of impairment “optional assessment” can be performed prior to necessitating a twostep quantitative impairment test should the optional assessment be performed for any given fiscal year qualitative factors to consider include cost factors financial performance legal regulatory contractual political business or other factors entity specific factors industry and market considerations macroeconomic conditions and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value then performing the twostep impairment test is unnecessary 

under the twostep quantitative impairment test we use discounted cash flow models that include assumptions regarding projected cash flows variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether goodwill is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge impairment charges if any result from instances where the fair values of net assets associated with goodwill are less than their carrying values as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

2016 form 10k 41 

table of contents 

for our annual impairment assessment in fiscal 2016  we utilized the optional assessment for the following reporting units platform solutions and emerging business “pseb” manufacturing mfg architecture engineering and construction aec and media and entertainment “me” based on a review of the qualitative factors described above we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value as a result we concluded that performing the twostep impairment test was not necessary and therefore the goodwill of our pseb mfg aec and me reporting units were not impaired during the fiscal year ended january 31 2016  

for the delcam reporting unit we deemed the twostep impairment test was necessary and used a discounted cash flow model which included assumptions regarding projected cash flows based on this testing we estimated fair value was 16  in excess of the carrying value for delcam and therefore the goodwill was not impaired during the fiscal year ended january 31 2016  

estimating the fair value of the reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments regarding future cash flows that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results forecasted billings revenue and spend targets discount rate assumptions and longterm growth rate assumptions the estimates and judgments described above could adversely change in future periods and we cannot provide absolute assurance that all of the targets will be achieved which could lead to future impairment charges   

realizability of longlived assets we assess the realizability of our longlived assets and related intangible assets other than goodwill annually during the fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review significant underperformance of a business or product line relative to budget shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends and the results of past impairment reviews when such events or changes in circumstances occur we assess recoverability of these assets 

we assess   recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows we would perform a discounted cash flow analysis to assess impairments on longlived assets variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge impairment charges if any result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values 

in addition to our recoverability assessments we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our longlived assets any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made as well as in subsequent quarters 

we will continue to evaluate the values of our longlived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability approach under this method deferred tax assets including those related to tax loss carryforwards and credits and deferred tax liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse we recognize the tax benefit for an uncertain tax position when it meets a more likely than not threshold we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense 

a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be recovered the valuation allowance is determined by assessing both positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable such assessment is required on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis significant judgment is required in determining whether the valuation allowance should be recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of future taxable income beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we considered recent cumulative losses in the united states arising from the company’s business model transition as a significant source of negative evidence considering this negative evidence and the absence of sufficient positive objective evidence that we would generate sufficient taxable income in our united states tax jurisdiction to realize the deferred tax assets we determined that is was not more likely than not that the company would realize us federal and state deferred tax assets and recorded a valuation allowance on our federal and state deferred tax assets as we continually strive to optimize our overall business model tax planning strategies may become feasible and prudent whereby management may determine that it is more 

2016 form 10k 42 

table of contents 

likely than not that the federal and state deferred tax assets will be realized therefore we will continue to evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax assets each quarter both in the us and in foreign jurisdictions based on all available evidence both positive and negative 

stockbased compensation  we measure stockbased compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award and recognize expense ratably over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period we estimate the fair value of certain stockbased payment awards including grants of employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan using either the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model or a binomiallattice model eg monte carlo simulation model to determine the grantdate fair value of our stockbased payment awards we use a blackscholes model or the quoted stock price on the date of grant unless the awards are subject to market conditions in which case we use the monte carlo simulation model the monte carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables to estimate the probability that market conditions will be achieved these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors the riskfree interest rate for the expected term of the award and expected dividends the variables used in these models are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted as needed sharebased compensation cost for restricted stock is measured on the closing fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

legal contingencies  as described in part i  item 3  “ legal proceedings ” and part ii  item 8  note 8  “ commitments and contingencies ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations

overview of fiscal 2016   



we are undergoing a business model transition in which we will discontinue selling new perpetual licenses in favor of subscriptions and flexible license arrangements during the transition billings revenue gross margin operating margin eps deferred revenue and cash flow from operations will be impacted as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than up front and as new offerings bring a wider variety of price points in order to help better understand our financial performance during and after the transition we have introduced several new metrics including recurring revenue total subscriptions arr and annualized revenue per subscription arps arr and arps are performance metrics and should be viewed independently of revenue deferred revenue and net billings as arr and arps are not intended to be combined with any of these items 

during fiscal 2016  net revenue decreased slightly as compared to the prior fiscal year gross profit decreased   2  and income from operations decreased   99  contributing to the year over year decrease in income from operations during fiscal 2016  was an increase in both operating expenses and cost of revenue and a decrease in license and other revenue partially offset by an increase in subscription revenue areas of revenue growth yearoveryear included increases in our aec segment 

2016 form 10k 43 

table of contents 

highlighted by an increase in our flexible enterprise offerings our mfg segment fueled by growth in delcam and autocad mechanical and the americas geographic area we also experienced growth in our total subscriptions and billings during fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  primarily due to strong maintenance renewals and growth in new offerings such as desktop subscriptions and enterprise offerings offsetting these areas of growth were yearoveryear revenue declines in our pseb segment many of our major products particularly autocad lt and the emea and apac geographic areas 

  

income from operations for fiscal 2016  was negatively impacted by increased spend primarily from higher employeerelated and cloudrelated costs as well as increased spending on other key initiatives 

the reasons for these changes are discussed below under the heading “results from operations” 

revenue analysis 

revenue from flagship products represented 45  and 48  of total net revenue during fiscal 2016  and fiscal 2015  respectively revenue from flagship products decreased  by 5  as compared to the prior fiscal year revenue from suites represented 37  and 36  of total net revenue for fiscal 2016  and fiscal 2015  respectively and remained flat compared to the prior fiscal year revenue from new and adjacent products represented 18  and 16  of total net revenue during fiscal 2016  and fiscal 2015  respectively revenue from new and adjacent products increased by 12  as compared to fiscal 2015  

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including tech data corporation and its global affiliates collectively “tech data” tech data accounted for 25  of our consolidated net revenue during both fiscal 2016  and 2015  respectively we believe our business is not substantially dependent on tech data our customers through tech data are the resellers and end users who purchase our software licenses and services should any of the agreements between tech data and us be terminated for any reason we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue 

operating margin analysis 

income from operations decreased   99  in fiscal 2016  due to an  827 million  or 4  increase in our operating expenses and a 286 million  or 8  increase in cost of revenue as compared to fiscal 2015  our operating margin decreased to 0  for fiscal 2016  from 5  for fiscal 2015  the increase in cost of revenue was driven by employee related expenses as a result of increased employee headcount and product support costs also contributing to the increase in cost of revenue was an increase in cloud and hosting related costs in support of our business model transition the increase in operating expenses between fiscal 2016  and 2015  was driven by higher employee related costs due to increased headcount and an increase in it costs also impacting the increase in operating expenses during fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  was an increase stock based compensation expense as a result of higher fair market value of awards granted 

further discussion regarding the cost of revenue and operating expense activities are discussed below under the heading “results of operations” 

business model transition metrics 

recurring revenue represents the revenue for the period from our maintenance desktop cloud services and enterprise license offerings including portions of revenue allocated to license  other revenue for those offerings it excludes revenue from autodesk consulting services and subscription revenue related to education offerings consumer product offerings select creative finishing product offerings autodesk buzzsaw autodesk constructware and third party products recurring revenue acquired with the acquisition of a business is captured and may cause variability in the comparison of this calculation  recurring revenue is a statistical measure rather than a nongaap measure and is not meant as a substitute for net revenues 

during fiscal 2016  recurring revenue was 54  of total net revenue as compared to 46  of total net revenue for fiscal 2015  

2016 form 10k 44 

table of contents 

the following table outlines our subscriptions arr and arps metrics as of fiscal years ended january 31 2016  and january 31 2015  

yearoveryear maintenance subscriptions increased 7 as of january 31 2016 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year yearoveryear new model subscriptions increased 94 as of january 31 2016  as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year primarily due to 292 growth in desktop subscriptions over the corresponding period also contributing to the overall subscription growth was an increase in maintenance renewal rates 

total subscriptions arr increased 10 as of january 31 2016 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year primarily due to a 68 increase in new model arr driven by desktop license subscriptions and our flexible enterprise offerings also contributing to the increase was growth in maintenance arr which increased 2 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year 

the 5  decrease in total arps was primarily due to growth in lowerpriced subscription offerings causing total subscriptions growth to exceed total subscriptions arr growth 

foreign currency analysis 

we generate a significant amount of our revenue in the us japan germany france and the united kingdom total net revenue for fiscal 2016  was flat on an as reported basis compared to the prior fiscal year and was negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate changes during fiscal 2016  had applicable exchange rates from fiscal 2015  been in effect during fiscal 2016  and had we excluded foreign exchange hedge gains and losses from both fiscal 2015  and 2016  “on a constant currency basis” net revenue would have increased   4  compared to the prior fiscal year 

our total spend defined as cost of revenue plus operating expenses during fiscal 2016   increased   5  on an as reported basis as compared to the prior fiscal year had applicable exchange rates from fiscal 2015  been in effect during fiscal 2016  and had we excluded foreign exchange hedge gains and losses from both fiscal 2015  and 2016  total spend would have increased   9  on a constant currency basis compared to the prior fiscal year 

changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue total spend and income from operations in future periods we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on a portion of the net revenue and spend of certain anticipated transactions but do not attempt to completely mitigate the impact of fluctuations of such foreign currency against the us dollar

business outlook 

autodesk is undergoing a business model transition in which the company will discontinue selling new perpetual licenses in favor of subscriptions and flexible license arrangements during the transition billings revenue gross margin operating margin eps deferred revenue and cash flow from operations will be impacted as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than up front and as new offerings bring a wider variety of price points over time we expect our business model transition to expand our customer base by eliminating higher upfront licensing costs and provide more flexibility in how customers gain access to and pay for our products in the future we expect this business model transition will increase our longterm revenue growth rate by increasing total subscriptions arr and customer value over time 

in february 2016 we commenced a restructuring plan to reduce headcount by approximately 10 and to consolidate certain facilities around the world in order to accelerate the company’s move to the cloud and its transition to a subscriptionbased business model through the restructuring we seek to reduce expenses streamline the organization and reallocate resources to align more closely with the company’s needs going forward see further discussion of our restructuring plan in note 17 “subsequent events” of the notes to consolidated financial statements as a result of these actions we have incurred and will incur additional costs in the short term that negatively impact our net income and cash flows from operating activities and have the effect of reducing our operating margins

interest and other expense net decreased  161 million  during fiscal 2016  as compared to fiscal 2015  the decrease is primarily related to nonrecurring settlement gains on certain of our privatelyheld strategic investments and marktomark gains recognized on the derivative portion on certain of our other privatelyheld strategic investments during the current fiscal year comparatively we incurred nonrecurring impairment losses on certain of our privatelyheld strategic investments in the same periods in the prior fiscal year this decrease was offset by an increase in interest expense resulting from the june 2015 issuance of  4500 million  aggregate principal amount of 3125  senior notes due june 15 2020  and  3000 million  aggregate principal amount of 4375  senior notes due june 15 2025

provision for income taxes 

we account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse 

income tax expense was 3102 million  and 12 million  for fiscal 2016  and 2015  respectively relative to a pretax loss of 203 million  and pretax income of 830 million  respectively for the same periods tax expense for fiscal 2016 consists primarily of foreign taxes and changes to valuation allowances including a 2308 million valuation allowance against the companys us federal and remaining state deferred tax assets recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in making that assessment we consider both positive and negative evidence whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance we considered recent cumulative losses in the united states arising from the companys business model transition as a significant piece of negative evidence and determined that it was more likely than not that the federal and state deferred tax assets would not be realized 

income tax expense was 12 million  and 511 million  for fiscal 2015  and 2014  respectively relative to pretax income of 830 million  and 2799 million  respectively for the same periods our effective tax rate was 1  and 18  during fiscal 2015  and 2014  respectively our effective tax rate decreased seventeen percentage points from fiscal 2014  to fiscal 2015  due to an increase in tax benefits from foreign earnings taxed at different rates in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  and increased benefit from research credits offset in part by lower tax benefits from stockbased compensation 

the protecting americans from tax hikes path act of 2015 enacted on december 18 2015 extended and made permanent the federal rd tax credit as a result our income tax provision for fiscal 2016 includes a tax benefit of 94 million  which was offset by the valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets 

our future effective annual tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate changes in valuation allowances level of profit before tax accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits and changes in tax laws including possible us tax law changes that if enacted could significantly impact how us multinational companies are taxed on foreign subsidiary earnings a significant amount of our earnings is generated by our europe and asia pacific subsidiaries our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates or we repatriate certain foreign earnings on which us taxes have not previously been provided 

at january 31 2016  we had noncurrent foreign net deferred tax assets of  92 million  which management believes are more likely than not to be realized in future years

other financial information 

in addition to our results determined under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” discussed above we believe the following nongaap measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the fiscal years ended january 31 2016  2015  and 2014  our gross profit gross margin income from operations operating margin net loss income and diluted net loss income per share on a gaap and nongaap basis were as follows in millions except for yearoveryear change in total net revenue and billings yearoveryear change in net subscription revenue and billings gross margin operating margin and per share data 



  

 

 

for our internal budgeting and resource allocation process and as a means to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons we use nongaap measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis these nongaap measures do not include certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results we also use nongaap measures in making operating decisions because we believe those measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our earning potential and performance for management by excluding certain expenses and charges that may not be indicative of our core business operating results for the reasons set forth below we believe these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors both because 1 they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and 2 they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business this allows investors and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management compare financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the longterm performance of our core business we also use some of these measures for purposes of determining companywide incentive compensation 

there are limitations in using nongaap financial measures because nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies the nongaap financial measures included above are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results in addition they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the nongaap financial measures we compensate for these limitations by

analyzing current and future results on a gaap basis as well as a nongaap basis and also by providing gaap measures in our public disclosures the presentation of nongaap financial information is meant to be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or in isolation from the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap we urge investors to review the reconciliation of our nongaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures included below and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business

our nongaap financial measures may exclude the following 

stockbased compensation expense s we exclude stockbased compensation expenses from nongaap measures primarily because they are noncash expenses and management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods moreover because of varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under fasb asc topic 718 we believe excluding stockbased compensation expenses allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies 

amortization of acquisitionrelated developed technologies and purchased intangibles we incur amortization of acquisitionrelated developed technology and purchased intangibles in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangibles is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions management finds it useful to exclude these variable charges from our cost of revenues to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangible assets will recur in future periods 

goodwill impairment this is a noncash charge to writedown goodwill to fair value when there was an indication that the asset was impaired as explained above management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

restructuring charges benefits net these expenses are associated with realigning our business strategies based on current economic conditions in connection with these restructuring actions we recognize costs related to termination benefits for former employees whose positions were eliminated and the closure of facilities and cancellation of certain contracts we exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing business and operating results we believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses 

loss gain on strategic investments  we exclude gains and losses related to our strategic investments from our nongaap measures primarily because management finds it useful to exclude these variable gains and losses on these investments in assessing our financial results included in these amounts are noncash unrealized gains and losses on the derivative components and realized gains and losses on the sale or losses on the impairment of these investments we believe excluding these items is useful to investors because these excluded items do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business and these losses or gains were incurred in connection with strategic investments which do not occur regularly

establishment of a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets this is a noncash charge to record a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets as explained above management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various cash expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

discrete tax items  we exclude the gaap tax provision including discrete items from the nongaap measure of income and include a nongaap tax provision based upon the projected annual nongaap effective tax rate discrete tax items include income tax expenses or benefits that do not relate to ordinary income from continuing operations in the current fiscal year unusual or infrequently occurring items or the tax impact of certain stockbased compensation examples of discrete tax items include but are not limited to certain changes in judgment and changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years certain costs related to business combinations certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets or changes in tax law management believes this approach assists investors in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations we believe the exclusion of these discrete tax items provides investors with useful supplemental information about the companys operational performance 

income tax effects on the difference between gaap and nongaap costs and expenses  the income tax effects that are excluded from the nongaap measures relate to the tax impact on the difference between gaap and nongaap expenses primarily due to stockbased compensation amortization of purchased intangibles and restructuring charges benefits for gaap and nongaap measures 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of cash is from the sale of licenses to our products our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employeerelated expenses such as compensation and benefits as well as general operating expenses for marketing facilities and overhead costs in addition to operating expenses we also use cash to fund our stock repurchase program and invest in our growth initiatives which include acquisitions of products technology and businesses see further discussion of these items below 

at january 31 2016  our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  28 billion  and net accounts receivable of  6536 million  net of longterm debt we have cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 13 billion  at january 31 2016  

in june 2015 we issued  4500 million  aggregate principal amount of 3125  senior notes due june 15 2020  and  3000 million  aggregate principal amount of 4375  senior notes due june 15 2025  in december 2012 we issued  4000 million  aggregate principal amount of 195  notes due december 15 2017  and  3500 million  aggregate principal amount of 36  notes due december 15 2022  all four series of notes collectively the “notes” as of march 23 2016  we have  15 billion  aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding in addition we have a line of credit facility that permits unsecured shortterm borrowings of up to  4000 million  as of march 23 2016  we have no  amounts outstanding under the credit facility in may 2015 autodesk amended and restated the credit agreement to extend the facilitys maturity date from may 2018 to may 2020  and to amend the financial covenants borrowings under the credit facility and the net proceeds from the offering of the notes are available for general corporate purposes 

our cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally our primary commercial banking relationship is with citigroup and its global affiliates in addition citibank na an affiliate of citigroup is one of the lead lenders and agent in the syndicate of our  4000 million  line of credit 

the increase in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities to  28 billion  at january 31 2016  from  23 billion  at january 31 2015  was primarily the result of the proceeds from the issuance of our june 2015 notes and the result of cash generated from operations these increases to cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were partially offset by cash used for repurchases of our common stock net of stock issuance proceeds acquisitions including business combinations and technology purchases capital expenditures and other investing activities the cash proceeds from issuance of common stock vary based on our stock price stock option exercise activity and the volume of employee purchases under the employee stock purchase plan 

the primary source of net cash provided by operating activities of  4140 million  in fiscal 2016  was 5789 million  of noncash expenses including our deferred tax asset valuation allowance stockbased compensation expense and depreciation amortization and accretion expense offsetting our net loss of 3305 million  in addition net cash flow provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities was 1906 million  the primary working capital sources of cash was an increase in deferred revenue for fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  our days sales outstanding in trade receivables was 92  at january 31 2016   

2016 form 10k 60 

table of contents 

compared to 63  at january 31 2015  the increase in days sales outstanding primarily relates to a shift in billings linearity the primary working capital use of cash was an increase in accounts receivable for fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  

at january 31 2016  our shortterm investment portfolio had an estimated fair value of  8979 million  and a cost basis of  8990 million  the portfolio fair value consisted of 3769 million  invested in corporate debt securities 1903 million  invested in certificates of deposit 1411 million  invested in commercial paper 746 million  invested in us treasury bills 399 million  invested in us government agency securities 201 million  invested in sovereign debt 97 million  invested in municipal securities and 73 million  invested in asset backed securities and  380 million  of trading securities invested in a defined set of mutual funds as directed by the participants in our deferred compensation plan see note 6  “ deferred compensation ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

longterm cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following common stock repurchases the acquisition of businesses software products or technologies complementary to our business and capital expenditures including the purchase and implementation of internaluse software applications 

our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products technology and businesses acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers however they entail cost and integration challenges and in certain instances negatively impact our operating margins we continually review these tradeoffs in making decisions regarding acquisitions we currently anticipate that we will continue to acquire products technology and businesses as compelling opportunities become available our decision to acquire businesses or technology is dependent on our business needs the availability of suitable sellers and technology and our own financial condition 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances are concentrated in a few locations around the world with substantial amounts held outside of the us as of january 31 2016  approximately 74  of our total cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are located offshore and will fluctuate subject to business needs certain amounts held outside the us could be repatriated to the us subject to local law restrictions but under current us tax law could be subject to us income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits we have provided for the us income tax liability on foreign earnings except for foreign earnings that are considered permanently reinvested outside the us our intent is that amounts related to foreign earnings permanently reinvested outside the us will remain outside the us and we will meet our us liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings or both we regularly review our capital structure and consider a variety of potential financing alternatives and planning strategies to ensure we have the proper liquidity available in the locations in which it is needed and to fund our existing stock buyback program with cash that has not been permanently reinvested outside the us 

cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the risks detailed in part i item 1a  titled “ risk factors ” however based on our current business plan and revenue prospects we believe that our existing balances our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months 

our revenue earnings cash flows receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for which we have put in place foreign currency contracts as part of our risk management strategy see part ii item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at january 31 2016  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 



 

 

notes consist of the senior notes issued in december 2012 and june 2015 the 2012 senior notes consist of  4000 million  aggregate principal amount of 195  senior notes due december 15 2017  notes and  3500 million  aggregate principal amount of 36  senior notes due december 15 2022  the 2015 senior notes consist of  4500 million  aggregate principal amount of 3125  senior notes due june 15 2020  and  3000 million  aggregate principal amount of 4375  senior notes due june 15 2025  

operating lease obligations consist primarily of obligations for facilities net of sublease income computer equipment and other equipment leases 

purchase obligations are contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services and are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on autodesk and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligations relate primarily to enterprise subscription agreements it infrastructure costs and marketing costs 

deferred compensation obligations relate to amounts held in a rabbi trust under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan see note 6  “ deferred compensation ” in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this plan 

pension obligations relate to our obligations for pension plans outside of the us see note 14  “ retirement benefit plans ” in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these obligations 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months in addition we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees including limited product warranties historically costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant but because potential future costs are highly variable we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations

issuer purchases of equity securities 

autodesks stock repurchase program is largely to help offset the dilution from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and for such other purposes as may be in the interests of autodesk and its stockholders and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders the number of shares acquired and the timing of the purchases are based on several factors including general market and economic conditions the number of employee stock option exercises and restricted stock unit issuances the trading price of autodesk common stock cash on hand and available in the united states cash requirements for acquisitions and company defined trading windows during the three and twelve months ended january 31 2016  we repurchased 16 million  and 85 million  shares of our common stock respectively at january 31 2016  63 million  shares remained available for repurchase under our current repurchase program approved by the board of directors this program does not have a fixed expiration date see note 9  “ stockholders equity ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

foreign currency exchange risk 

our revenue earnings cash flows receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency volatility that exists as part of our ongoing business operations we utilize cash flow hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions in addition we use balance sheet hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables and payables as of january 31 2016  and 2015  we had open cash flow and balance sheet hedge contracts with future settlements within one to twelve months contracts were primarily denominated in euros japanese yen swiss francs british pounds canadian dollars and australian dollars we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes the notional amount of our option and forward contracts was  3740 million  and  3812 million  at january 31 2016  and 2015  respectively 

we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue and operating expenses of certain anticipated transactions a sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january 31 2016  indicated that a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 31 2016  and 2015  would increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by 333 million  and 351 million  respectively a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the dollar from its value at january 31 2016  and 2015  would decrease the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by  256 million  and  165 million  respectively 

interest rate risk 

interest rate movements affect both the interest income we earn on our short term investments and the market value of certain longer term securities at january 31 2016  we had 23054 million  of cash equivalents and marketable securities including 8979 million  classified as shortterm marketable securities and 5323 million  classified as longterm marketable securities if interest rates were to move up by 50 or 100 basis points over a twelve month period the potential decline in fair value on our marketable securities would be 55 million  or 98 million  respectively 

other market risk 

from time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies the privately held companies in which we invest are considered inherently risky the technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies see note 2   financial instruments  for further discussion regarding our privately held investments

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the exchange act our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules of the securities and exchange commission and ii accumulated and communicated to autodesk management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k based upon this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of january 31 2016  for reasons described below 

however corrective actions have been initiated to address the internal control weakness as described below under the section remediation efforts with respect to material weakness 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2016  in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in the 2013 internal control—integrated framework our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within autodesk have been detected 

during the year ended january 31 2016  our management has concluded our internal control over financial reporting was not effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles due to the material weakness discussed in further detail below our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in item 8 herein 

in connection with the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended october 31 2015 our management concluded that a material weakness exists in our internal control over financial reporting related to our controls over the technical review of our reconciliation of our deferred tax accounts and the effective tax rate a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

we have performed additional analyses and other procedures to enable management to conclude that notwithstanding the existence of the material weakness described above the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k present fairly in all material respects our financial position results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with gaap 

2016 form 10k 111

remediation efforts with respect to material weakness 

management initiated remediation plans including the following 

 

 

 

 

management will continue to enhance its controls to include refinements and improvements to certain controls over the accounting for income taxes the company’s enhanced controls will continue to evolve and have not had a sufficient period of time to operate for management to conclude that they were operating effectively management believes the foregoing efforts will effectively remediate the material weakness 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

other than with respect to the remediation efforts described above there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as such term is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 during the quarter ended january 31 2016  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting

product development and introduction 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware operating systems and software in addition our customers’ requirements and preferences rapidly evolve as do their expectations of the performance of our software to keep pace with these changes we maintain a vigorous program of new product development to address demands in the marketplace for our products 

the software industry is undergoing a transition from the personal computer to cloud social and mobile computing in fiscal 2015 we continued to successfully implement a strategic transition of our business model announced in fiscal 2014 we accelerated our move to the cloud and expanded our flexible product license offerings we introduced desktop subscription formerly known as rental for a broader range of our product portfolio expanded our new tokenbased licensing program to more enterprise customers and continued to expand our industry leading cloud based offerings these offerings are designed to give our customers even more value and flexibility to use our products and also to attract new types of customers such as projectbased users and small businesses that have more variable needs further to support our transition we have discontinued licensing upgrades effective march 6 2015 and on february 4 2015 we also announced that new commercial seats of most standalone software products will be available only by desktop subscription beginning february 1 2016 collectively these measures helped increase many of our performance metrics including billings deferred revenue and subscriptions which will result in more predictable and ratable revenue over time 

we dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to further enhance our existing products and to create new products and technologies for example in fiscal 2015 we announced that we would create spark a 3d printing software platform for developers to facilitate the advancement of 3d printing technology and begin manufacturing and selling ember an autodeskbranded 3d printer the ember 3d printer became available for consumer purchase in february 2015 

research and development expenditures were  7252 million  or 29  of fiscal 2015  net revenue  6111 million  or 27  of fiscal 2014  net revenue and  6000 million  or 26  of fiscal 2013  net revenue our software is primarily developed internally however we also use independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities additionally we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing or licensing products and technology from third parties we continually review these investments in an effort to ensure that we are generating sufficient revenue or gaining a competitive advantage to justify their costs 

the majority of our research and product development is performed in the united states china singapore and canada however we employ experienced software developers in many of our other locations translation and localization of our products are performed in a number of local markets principally singapore and switzerland we generally localize and translate our products into german french italian spanish russian japanese korean and simplified and traditional chinese 

we plan to continue to manage significant product development operations internationally over the next several years we believe that our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize product development lower costs and integrate local market knowledge into our development activities we continually assess the significant costs and challenges including intellectual property protection against the benefits of our international development activities

in addition our business and our customers benefit from our relationships with a network of over 4000  thirdparty developers who develop and sell their own products that further enhance the range of integrated solutions available to our customers 

for further discussion regarding risks from our product development and introduction efforts see item 1a  “ risk factors ” 

marketing and sales 

we license or sell our products and services globally primarily through indirect channels consisting of distributors and resellers to a lesser extent we also transact directly with a select set of customers who are primarily large corporations our indirect channel model includes both a twotiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a onetiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers we have a network of approximately 2200  resellers and distributors worldwide for fiscal 2015  approximately 83  of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the future we anticipate that our channel mix will change to support our new business model and plan to proactively work with our channel partners to ensure a smooth transition we employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our reseller channel with our business strategies sales through our largest distributor tech data corporation and its affiliates accounted for 25  24  and 23  of our net revenue for fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively we believe our business is not substantially dependent on tech data our customers through tech data are the resellers and end users who purchase our software licenses and services should any of the agreements between us and tech data be terminated for any reason we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue no other distributor reseller or direct customer accounted for 10 or more of our revenue 

our customerrelated operations are divided into three geographic regions the americas europe middle east and africa “emea” and asia pacific “apac” each geographic region is supported by global marketing and sales organizations these organizations develop and manage overall marketing and sales programs and work closely with a network of domestic and international sales offices fiscal 2015  net revenue in the americas emea and apac was  8980 million   36   9800 million   39  and  6342 million   25  respectively we intend to continue to make our products available in foreign languages we believe that international sales will continue to comprise the majority of our total net revenue adverse economic conditions and currency exchange rates in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue including emerging economies may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance a summary of our financial information by geographic location is found in note 13  “ segments ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements our international operations and sales subject us to a variety of risks see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion 

we also work directly with reseller and distributor sales organizations computer manufacturers other software developers and peripherals manufacturers in cooperative advertising promotions and tradeshow presentations we employ massmarketing techniques such as webcasts seminars telemarketing direct mailings sponsorships advertising in business and trade journals and social media we have a worldwide user group organization and we have created online user communities dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products 

in addition to sales of new perpetual use software licenses we generate revenue through several subscriptionbased business models the largest is our maintenance program under which customers who own a perpetual use license for the most recent version of the underlying product are able to purchase maintenance that provides them with unspecified upgrades whenandifavailable and are able to download elearning courses and receive online support over a one year or multiyear maintenance service period we also offer more flexible termbased license offerings to our customers 

our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller networks the loss of or a significant reduction in business with any one of our major distributors or large resellers could harm our business see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion

customer and reseller support 

we provide technical support and training to customers through a leveraged support model augmented by direct programs designed to address certain specific needs our customers rely primarily on the resellers and distributors from which they purchased licenses to our products for technical support however we do provide certain direct support for some of our customers we support our resellers and distributors through technical product training sales training classes the internet and telephone we also provide online support directly to our customers through our maintenance program there are also a number of user group forums in which customers are able to share information 

education sustainability and philanthropic programs 

education 

our education initiatives inspire the youth of today to imagine design and create a better world by offering free educational licenses of autodesk software worldwide to students educators and educational institutions 

  

we help fuel a lifelong passion for design in students of all ages and collaborate with educators institutions and partners that encourage design learning and further science technology engineering digital arts and math steam education objectives within the secondary and postsecondary global education markets our learning content and standards based curriculum enable tomorrow’s workforce to graduate industryready with marketable design skills that are in high demand whether these students are future professional designers or lifelong design hobbyists our full portfolio of professionalgrade and personal design products introduces students and educators at all levels to software that can unleash their creativity 

sustainability 

to help our customers imagine design and create a better world our sustainability programs focus our efforts where we can have the greatest impact providing sustainability solutions delivering sustainable design learning and training opportunities expanding access to technology and leading by example with our sustainable business practices this benefits our customers who use our products and services to improve design decisions that have substantial and longterm environmental impacts through access to free resources including the autodesk sustainability workshop building performance analysis certificate bpac program and building design courses students and professionals are learning how to use design technology and analytics to make better more sustainable design decisions during the design process 

philanthropy 

the autodesk foundation the foundation a privately funded 501c3 charity organization established and solely funded by us leads our philanthropic efforts the purpose of the foundation is twofold to support employees to create a better world at work at home and in the community by matching employee’s volunteer time andor donations to nonprofit organizations and to support organizations and individuals using design to drive positive social and environmental impact in the latter case we use grant funding software donations and training to accomplish this goal selecting the most impactful and innovative organizations around the world thus leading to a better future for our planet on our behalf the foundation also administers a discounted software donation program to nonprofit organizations social and environmental entrepreneurs and others who are developing design solutions that will shape a more sustainable future 

developer programs 

one of our key strategies is to maintain an openarchitecture design of our software products to facilitate thirdparty development of complementary products and industryspecific software solutions this approach enables customers and third parties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses we offer several programs that provide marketing sales technical support and programming tools to developers who develop addon applications for our products over 4000  developers in the autodesk developer network create interoperable products that further enhance the range of integrated solutions available to our customers 

competition 

the markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to rapid change we strive to increase our competitive separation by investing in research and development allowing us to bring new products to market and create exciting new versions of existing products that offer compelling efficiencies for our customers we also compete through investments in marketing and sales to more effectively reach new customers and better serve existing customers

table of contents 

our competitors include large global publicly traded companies small geographically focused firms startup firms and solutions produced inhouse by their users our primary global competitors in the pseb aec and mfg segments include adobe systems incorporated ansys inc aveva group plc bentley systems incorporated dassault systèmes sa and its subsidiary dassault systèmes solidworks corp environmental systems research institute inc esri intergraph corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of hexagon ab msc software corporation nemetschek ag ptc 3d systems seimens plm and trimble navigation limited 

our me segment also competes with a wide range of different companies from large global publiclytraded companies to small private entities large organizations that produce products that compete in some or all of our markets include adobe systems incorporated apple inc avid technology inc sony corporation and technicolor among others the media and entertainment market is highly fragmented with complex interdependencies between many of the larger businesses as a result some of our competitors also own subsidiaries that are our customers or our partners in developing or bringing to market some of our solutions in addition to traditional competitors in developed economies we encounter new competitors in emerging economies 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing power with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the industry is presently undergoing a platform shift from the personal computer to cloud and mobile computing this shift further lowers barriers to entry and poses a disruptive challenge to established software companies the design software market is characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete both from existing competitors and by entry of new competitors with innovative technologies competition is increasingly enhanced by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies and the possibility that competitors in one vertical segment may enter other vertical segments that we serve in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources than we do because of these and other factors competitive conditions in these industries are likely to continue to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which could harm our business see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion of risks regarding competition 

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to better serve customers by offering new products including cloud and mobile computing products whether by internal development or acquisition and to continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to ease of use reliability performance range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation price and training 

intellectual property and licenses 

we maintain an active program to legally protect our investment in technology through intellectual property rights we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions the nature and extent of legal protection associated with each such intellectual property right depends on among other things the type of intellectual property right and the given jurisdiction in which such right arises we believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business including each of our segments 

nonetheless our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws and enforcement of the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws enforcement of intellectual property rights against alleged infringers can sometimes lead to costly litigation and counterclaims our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business 

from time to time we receive claims alleging infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights including patents disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to among other things costly litigation or product shipment delays which could harm our business 

we retain ownership of software we develop desktop software is licensed to users pursuant to ‘click through’ or signed license agreements containing restrictions on duplication disclosure and transfer cloud software and associated services are provided to users pursuant to online or signed terms of service agreements containing restrictions on access and use 

2015 form 10k 11 

table of contents 

we believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our intellectual property and the rapid ongoing technological changes in both the computer hardware and software industries we must rely principally upon software engineering and marketing skills to continually maintain and enhance our competitive market position 

while we have recovered some revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the full extent to which piracy of our software products exists we believe however that software piracy is and can be expected to be a persistent problem that negatively impacts our revenue and financial results we believe that our transition from perpetual use software licenses to a subscriptionbased business model combined with the change from desktop to cloudbased computing will shift the incentives and means by which software is pirated 

in addition through various licensing arrangements we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others we expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing arrangements in the future as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions to support continued development and sales of our products and services some of these licensing arrangements require or may require royalty payments and other licensing fees the amount of these payments and fees may depend on various factors including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments offsetting considerations if any and the degree of use of the licensed technology 

see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion of risks related to protecting our intellectual property 

production and suppliers 

the production of our pseb aec mfg and certain me software products involves duplication of the software media the purchase of media and the transfer of the software programs onto media for distribution to customers are performed by us and by licensed subcontractors media for our products such as dvds and usb flash drives are available from multiple sources for certain products and countries we offer customers an electronic software download option for both initial product fulfillment as well as product updates for maintenance subscribers customers who choose electronic fulfillment receive the latest version of the software from our vendor’s secure servers for certain cloudbased products we use a combination of colocated hosting facilities as well as infrastructureasaservice providers like amazon web services packaging materials are produced to our specifications by outside sources production is performed in leased facilities operated by independent thirdparty contractors to date we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the production of our software and documentation 

employees 

as of january 31 2015  we employed approximately 8823  people none of our employees in the united states are represented by a labor union in certain foreign countries our employees are represented by work councils we have never experienced any work stoppages and believe our employee relations are good reliance upon employees in other countries entails various risks and changes in these foreign countries such as government instability or regulation unfavorable to foreignowned businesses which could negatively impact our business in the future

acquisitions 

over the past three years we acquired new technology or supplemented our technology by purchasing businesses or certain technology related assets focused in specific markets or industries for the fiscal years ended january 31 2015  2014  and 2013  we acquired a number of companies and certain technology related assets some of which were accounted for as business combinations the following were key acquisitions for fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  

  



backlog 

we typically ship products shortly after receipt of an order which is common in the software industry our backlog consists of current software license product orders which have not yet shipped the category of current software license product orders which we have not yet shipped consists of orders from customers with approved credit status for currently available software products 

backlog was  404 million  at january 31 2015  compared to  197 million  at january 31 2014  the actual amount of backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects as this amount is impacted by a number of factors not related to future trends or events such as the order fulfillment process the method of software delivery or the linearity of our business within the fiscal period

 item 1a risk factors 

  

we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks a number of which are beyond our control in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following discussion highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on our business financial condition and future results of operations if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted causing the trading price of our common stock to decline in addition these risks and uncertainties may impact the “forwardlooking” statements described elsewhere in this form 10k and in the documents incorporated herein by reference they could affect our actual results of operations causing them to differ materially from those expressed in “forwardlooking” statements 

global economic and political conditions may further impact our business financial results and financial condition   

as our business has expanded globally we have increasingly become subject to risks arising from adverse changes in global economic and political conditions the past several years were characterized by weak global economic conditions volatile credit markets relatively high unemployment a low level of liquidity in many financial markets increased government deficit spending and debt levels uncertainty about certain governments abilities to repay such debt or to address certain fiscal issues and volatility in many financial instrument markets if economic growth in countries where we do business slows or if such countries experience further economic recessions customers may delay or reduce technology purchases this could result in reductions in sales of our products and services longer sales cycles and slower adoption of our technologies 

over the past several years many of our customers have experienced tighter credit negative financial news and weaker financial performance of their businesses and have reduced their workforces thereby reducing the number of licenses and the number of maintenance contracts they purchase from us in addition a number of our customers rely directly and indirectly on government spending current debt balances of many countries without proportionate increases in revenues have caused many countries to reduce spending and in some cases have forced those countries to restructure their debt in an effort to avoid defaulting under those obligations this has not only impacted those countries but others that are holders of such debt and those assisting in such restructuring 

these actions may impact and over the past several years have negatively impacted our business financial results and financial condition moreover our financial performance may be negatively impacted by 

 

 

 

 

 

uncertainty about current and future economic and political conditions on us our customers and partners makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments 

a slower economic recovery in industries important to our business may adversely affect our business financial results and financial condition if a macroeconomic recovery does not occur as rapidly as anticipated our ability to meet our longterm financial targets may also be adversely affected 

if we fail to successfully manage our business model transition to cloudbased products and more flexible product licenses our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

to address the industry transition from personal computer to cloud social and mobile computing we have accelerated our move to the cloud and are offering more flexible product licenses as part of this transition we announced in fiscal 2014 that we are discontinuing upgrades after fiscal 2015 and on february 4 2015 we also announced that new commercial seats of

most standalone software products will be available only by desktop subscription beginning february 1 2016 as a result we expect to derive an increasing portion of our revenues in the future from subscriptions this subscription model prices and delivers our products in a way that differs from the historical perpetual pricing and delivery methods these changes reflect a significant shift from perpetual license sales and distribution of our software in favor of providing our customers the right to access certain of our software in a hosted environment or use downloaded software for a specified subscription period 

our ability to achieve our financial objectives is subject to risks and uncertainties the new offerings require a considerable investment of technical financial legal and sales resources and a scalable organization market acceptance of such offerings is affected by a variety of factors including but not limited to security reliability performance current license terms customer preference socialcommunity engagement customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage their data public concerns regarding privacy and the enactment of restrictive laws or regulations whether our business model transition will prove successful and will accomplish our business and financial objectives is subject to numerous uncertainties including but not limited to customer demand attach and renewal rates channel acceptance our ability to further develop and scale infrastructure our ability to include functionality and usability in such offerings that address customer requirements tax and accounting implications pricing and our costs in addition the metrics we use to gauge the status of our business model transition may evolve over the course of the transition as significant trends emerge if we are unable to successfully establish these new offerings and navigate our business model transition in light of the foregoing risks and uncertainties our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

our strategy to develop and introduce new products and services exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance costs related to product defects and large expenditures that may not result in additional net revenue or could result in decreased net revenue 

rapid technological changes as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences characterize the software industry just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry 30 years ago we believe our industry is undergoing a similar transition from the personal computer to cloud mobile and social computing customers are also reconsidering the manner in which they license software products which requires us to constantly evaluate our business model and strategy in response we are focused on providing solutions to enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative on their projects we are also developing consumer products for digital art personal design and creativity and home design we devote significant resources to the development of new technologies in addition we frequently introduce new business models or methods that require a considerable investment of technical and financial resources such as an increase in our portfolio of and focus on suites and most recently our introduction of flexible license and service offerings we are making such investments through further development and enhancement of our existing products and services as well as through acquisitions of new product lines such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs and could result in decreased net revenue for example in fiscal 2015 we announced that we would create spark a 3d printing software platform for developers to facilitate the advancement of 3d printing technology and begin manufacturing and selling ember an autodeskbranded 3d printer if we are not able to meet customer requirements either with respect to our software or hardware products or the manner in which we provide such products or if we are not able to adapt our business model to meet our customers requirements our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted 

in particular a critical component of our growth strategy is to have customers of our autocad and autocad lt products expand their portfolios to include our suites and cloudbased services we want customers using standalone autodesk products to expand their portfolio with our suites and cloudbased offerings and we are taking steps to accelerate this migration at times sales of licenses of our autocad and autocad lt or standalone autodesk flagship products have decreased without a corresponding increase in suites product or cloudbased services revenue or without purchases of customer seats to our suites should this continue our results of operations will be adversely affected also adoption of our cloud and mobile computing offerings and changes in the delivery of our software and services to our customers such as desktop subscription formally referred to as rental offerings will change the way in which we recognize revenue relating to our software and services with a potential negative impact on our financial performance the accounting impact of these offerings and other business decisions are expected to result in an increase in the percentage of our ratable revenue as well as recurring revenue making for a more predictable business over time while potentially reducing our upfront perpetual revenue stream additionally the software products we offer are complex and despite extensive testing and quality control may contain errors or defects these errors or defects could result in the need for corrective releases to our software products damage to our reputation loss of revenue an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products any of which would likely harm our business 

our executive management team must act quickly continuously and with vision given the rapidly changing customer expectations and technology advancements inherent in the software industry the extensive and complex efforts required to

create useful and widely accepted products and the rapid evolution of cloud computing mobile devices new computing platforms and other technologies such as consumer products although we have articulated a strategy that we believe will fulfill these challenges if we fail to execute properly on that strategy or adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve we may fail to meet our customers expectations fail to compete with our competitors products and technology and lose the confidence of our channel partners and employees this in turn could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our entry into 3d printing presents many of the risks described above concerning developing and introducing new products as well as new risks for us the manufacturing and 3d printing markets are highly competitive and some of our competitors have superior experience and resources to us we have limited experience designing developing and selling hardware products and no experience developing and selling printers the market for 3d printing is nascent and may not develop as rapidly as we expect our sale of 3d printers could subject us to product and other liability that we do not currently face if any of these risks materialize it could adversely affect our business and financial performance as well as our reputation and brand 

we are dependent on international revenue and operations exposing us to significant regulatory global economic intellectual property collections currency exchange rate taxation political instability and other risks which could adversely impact our financial results 

we are dependent on our international operations for a significant portion of our revenue international net revenue represented 71  and 70  of our net revenue in fiscal 2015  and 2014  respectively our international revenue including that from emerging economies is subject to general economic and political conditions in foreign markets including conditions in foreign markets resulting from economic and political conditions in the us our revenue is also impacted by the relative geographical and country mix of our revenue over time at times these factors adversely impact our international revenue and consequently our business as a whole our dependency on international revenue makes us much more exposed to global economic and political trends which can negatively impact our financial results even if our results in the us are strong for a particular period further a significant portion of our earnings from our international operations may not be freely transferable to the us due to remittance restrictions adverse tax consequences or other factors our intent is that amounts related to foreign earnings permanently reinvested outside the us will remain outside the us and we will meet our us liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings such as our senior notes or both however if in the future amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are needed to fund our operations in the us or to service our external borrowings the repatriation of such amounts to the us could result in a significant incremental tax liability in the period in which the decision to repatriate occurs and payment of any such tax liability would reduce the cash available to fund our operations 

we anticipate that our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue and as we expand our international development sales and marketing expertise will provide significant support to our overall efforts in countries outside of the us risks inherent in our international operations include

some of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks 

existing and increased competition and rapidly evolving technological changes may reduce our revenue and profits 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing devices with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the industry is presently undergoing a platform shift from the personal computer to cloud and mobile computing this shift further lowers barriers to entry and poses a disruptive challenge to established software companies the markets in which we compete are characterized by vigorous competition both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources furthermore a reduction in the number and availability of compatible thirdparty applications or our inability to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes including those related to cloud computing mobile devices and new computing platforms may adversely affect the sale of our products because of these and other factors competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which would likely harm our business 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the us and we make certain business and resource decisions based on assumptions about foreign currency we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 

we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our cash flow exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as part of our risk management strategy we use foreign currency contracts to manage a portion of our exposures of underlying assets liabilities and other obligations which exist as part of our ongoing business operations these foreign currency instruments have maturities that extend for one to twelve months in the future and provide us with some protection against currency exposures however our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be completely successful resulting in an adverse impact on our financial results 

the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period although our foreign currency cash flow hedge program extends beyond the current quarter in order to reduce our exposure to foreign currency volatility we do not attempt to completely mitigate this risk and in any case will incur transaction fees in adopting such hedging programs such volatility even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings

if we do not maintain good relationships with the members of our distribution channel or achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected if our distribution channel suffers financial losses becomes financially unstable or insolvent or is not provided the right mix of incentives to sell our products our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected 

we sell our software products both directly to endusers and through a network of distributors and resellers for fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  approximately 83  and 84  of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers respectively and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the future our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller network computer software distributors and resellers typically are not highly capitalized have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and experienced difficulties during the past several years we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of distributors and resellers prior to our sales to them in the past we have taken steps to support them and may take additional steps in the future such as extending credit terms and providing temporary discounts these steps if taken could harm our financial results if our distributors and resellers were to become insolvent they would not be able to maintain their business and sales or provide customer support services which would negatively impact our business and revenue 

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including the distributor tech data corporation and its global affiliates “tech data” tech data accounted for 25  and 24  of our total net revenue for fiscal 2015  and 2014  respectively although we believe that we are not substantially dependent on tech data if tech data were to experience a significant disruption with its business or if our relationship with tech data were to significantly deteriorate it is possible that our ability to sell to end users would be at least temporarily negatively impacted this could in turn negatively impact our financial results 

over time we have modified and will continue to modify aspects of our relationship with our distributors and resellers such as their incentive programs pricing to them and our distribution model to motivate and reward them for aligning their businesses with our strategy and business objectives changes in these relationships and underlying programs could negatively impact their business and harm our business in addition the loss of or a significant reduction in business with those distributors or resellers or the failure to achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough with any one of our major international distributors or large resellers could harm our business in particular if one or more of such distributors or resellers were unable to meet their obligations with respect to accounts payable to us we could be forced to write off such accounts and may be required to delay the recognition of revenue on future sales to these customers these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

our financial results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenue and financial results difficult to predict 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so in the future these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines in addition to the other factors described in this part i  item 1a  some of the factors that could cause our financial results to fluctuate include

we have also experienced fluctuations in financial results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic or political conditions in particular our financial results in europe during our third quarter are usually affected by a slower summer period and our asia pacific operations typically experience seasonal slowing in our third and fourth quarters 

  

our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenue and are relatively fixed in the short term accordingly any revenue shortfall below expectations has had and in the future could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability greater than anticipated expenses or a failure to maintain rigorous cost controls would also negatively affect profitability 

our business could suffer as a result of risks costs and charges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments 

we regularly acquire or invest in businesses software products and technologies that are complementary to our business through acquisitions strategic alliances or equity or debt investments for example in fiscal 2015 we acquired delcam a leading supplier of advanced cadcam and industrial measurement solutions for the manufacturing industry the risks associated with such acquisitions include among others the difficulty of assimilating products operations and personnel inheriting liabilities such as intellectual property infringement claims the failure to realize anticipated revenue and cost projections the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business in accordance with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the diversion of managements time and attention 

in addition such acquisitions and investments involve other risks such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may not be successful in overcoming such risks and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business in addition such acquisitions and investments have in the past and may in the future contribute to potential fluctuations in our quarterly financial results these fluctuations could arise from transactionrelated costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or writeoffs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments these costs or charges could negatively impact our financial results for a given period cause quarter to quarter variability in our financial results or negatively impact our financial results for several future periods

because we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from a small number of products including our autocadbased software products and suites if these products are not successful our revenue will be adversely affected 

we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from sales of licenses of a limited number of our products including autocad software products based on autocad which include our suites that serve specific markets and products that are interoperable with autocad any factor adversely affecting sales of these products including the product release cycle market acceptance product competition performance and reliability reputation price competition economic and market conditions and the availability of thirdparty applications would likely harm our financial results during fiscal 2015  and 2014  combined revenue from our autocad and autocad lt products not including suites having autocad or autocad lt as a component represented 28  and 30  of our total net revenue respectively 

a breach of security in our products services or computer systems may compromise the integrity of our products or services harm our reputation create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results 

we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our source code and computer systems the risk of a security breach or disruption particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyber terrorists has increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased these threats include but are not limited to identity theft unauthorized access dns attacks wireless network attacks viruses and worms advanced persistent threat apt application centric attacks peertopeer attacks phishing backdoor trojans and distributed denial of service ddos attacks any of the foregoing could attack our products services or computer systems despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such programs it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk like all software our software is vulnerable to cyber attacks in the past hackers have targeted our software and they may do so in the future the impact of cyber attacks could disrupt the proper functioning of our software products or services cause errors in the output of our customers work allow unauthorized access to sensitive proprietary or confidential information of ours or our customers and other destructive outcomes m oreover as we continue to invest in new lines of consumer products and services we are exposed to increased security risks and the potential for unauthorized access to or improper use of the information of our consumer users if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation may suffer customers may stop buying our products or services we could face lawsuits and potential liability and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

we rely on third parties to provide us with a number of operational services including hosting and delivery and certain of our customer services and other operations any interruption or delay in service from these third parties breaches of security or privacy or failures in data collection could expose us to liability harm our reputation and adversely impact our financial performance 

we rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide our customers and computer operations for our internal use as we gather customer data and host certain customer data in thirdparty facilities a security breach could compromise the integrity or availability or result in the theft of customer data in addition our operations could be negatively affected in the event of a security breach and we could be subject to the loss or theft of confidential or proprietary information including source code 

unauthorized access to this data may be obtained through breakins breaches of our secure networks by unauthorized parties employee theft or misuse or other misconduct we rely on a number of thirdparty suppliers in the operation of our business for the provision of various services and materials that we use in the operation of our business and production of our products although we seek to diversify our thirdparty suppliers we may from time to time rely on a single or limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country for these services or materials the inability of such third parties to satisfy our requirements could disrupt our business operations or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy if any of these situations were to occur our reputation could be harmed we could be subject to thirdparty liability including under data protection and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights our business could be harmed 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright and trademark laws trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software products or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our software products is timeconsuming and costly we are unable to measure the 

2015 form 10k 22 

table of contents 

extent to which piracy of our software products exists and we expect that software piracy will remain a persistent problem particularly in emerging economies furthermore our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 

  

additionally we actively protect the secrecy of our confidential information and trade secrets including our source code if unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code the loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our financial performance and our reputation we also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of nondisclosure agreements with our customers contractors vendors and partners however it is possible that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization if this were to occur it may be difficult andor costly for us to enforce our rights and our financial performance and reputation could be negatively impacted 

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in the loss of significant rights 

as more software patents are granted worldwide the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims infringement or misappropriation claims have in the past been and may in the future be asserted against us and any such assertions could harm our business additionally certain patent holders without products have become more aggressive in threatening and pursuing litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents any such claims or threats whether with or without merit have been and could in the future be timeconsuming to defend result in costly litigation and diversion of resources cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in addition such royalty or license agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms if at all which would likely harm our business 

a significant portion of our revenue is generated through maintenance revenue decreases in maintenance attach or renewal rates or a decrease in the number of new licenses we sell would negatively impact our future revenue and financial results 

our maintenance customers have no obligation to attach maintenance to their initial license or renew their maintenance contract after the expiration of their initial maintenance period which is typically one year our customers attach and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the overall global economy the health of their businesses and the perceived value of the maintenance program if our customers do not attach maintenance to their initial license or renew their maintenance contract for our products our maintenance revenue will decline and our financial results will suffer 

in addition a portion of the growth of our maintenance revenue has typically been associated with growth of the number of licenses that we sell any reduction in the number of licenses that we sell even if our customers attach rates do not change will have a negative impact on our future maintenance revenue this in turn would impact our business and harm our financial results 

we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the term of the maintenance contracts which is predominantly one year but may also range up to five years decreases in maintenance billings will negatively impact future maintenance revenue however future maintenance revenue will also be impacted by other factors such as the amount timing and mix of contract terms of future billings 

from time to time we realign or introduce new business and sales initiatives if we fail to successfully execute and manage these initiatives our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

as part of our effort to accommodate our customers needs and demands and the rapid evolution of technology we from time to time evolve our business and sales initiatives such as realigning our development and marketing organizations and expanding our portfolio of suites and our offering of software as a service and realigning our internal resources in an effort to improve efficiency we may take such actions without clear indications that they will prove successful and at times we have been met with shortterm challenges in the execution of such initiatives market acceptance of any new business or sales initiative is dependent on our ability to match our customers needs at the right time and price often we have limited prior experience and operating history in these new areas of emphasis if any of our assumptions about expenses revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated and our financial results will be negatively impacted

net revenue billings earnings or subscriptions shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline 

the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including the other factors described in this part i  item 1a  and the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant changes in the price of our common stock could expose us to additional costly and timeconsuming litigation historically after periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities a company becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts managements attention and resources 

our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our success and ability to invest and grow depend largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical professional managerial sales and marketing personnel historically competition for these key personnel has been intense the loss of services of any of our key personnel including key personnel joining our company through acquisitions the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions and financial goals

changes in laws andor regulations related to the internet or related to privacy and data security concerns may impact our business or expose us to increased liability 

the future success of our business depends upon the continued use of the internet as a primary medium for commerce communication and business applications federal state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws or regulations affecting data privacy and the transmission of certain types of content using the internet for example the state of california has adopted legislation requiring operators of commercial websites and mobile applications that collect personal information from california residents to conspicuously post and comply with privacy policies that satisfy certain requirements several other us states have adopted legislation requiring companies to protect the security of personal information that they collect from consumers over the internet and more states may adopt similar legislation in the future additionally the federal trade commission has used its authority under section 5 of the federal trade commission act to bring actions against companies for failing to maintain adequate security for personal information collected from consumers over the internet and for failing to comply with privacyrelated representations made to internet users the us congress has at various times proposed federal legislation intended to protect the privacy of internet users and the security of personal information collected from internet users that would impose additional compliance burdens upon companies collecting personal information from internet users and the us congress may adopt such legislation in the future the european union also has adopted various directives regulating data privacy and security and the transmission of content using the internet involving residents of the european union including those directives known as the data protection directive the eprivacy directive and the privacy and electronic communications directive and may adopt similar directives in the future several other countries including canada and several latin american and asian countries have constitutional protections for or have adopted legislation protecting individuals personal information additionally some federal state or foreign governmental bodies have established laws that seek to censor the transmission of certain types of content over the internet or require that individuals be provided with the ability to permanently delete all electronic personal information such as the german multimedia law of 1997 

given the variety of global privacy and data protection regimes it is possible we may find ourselves subject to inconsistent obligations for instance the usa patriot act is considered by some to be in conflict with certain directives of the european union situations such as these require that we make prospective determinations regarding compliance with conflicting regulations increased enforcement of existing laws and regulations as well as any laws regulations or changes that may be adopted or implemented in the future could limit the growth of the use of public cloud applications or communications generally result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internetbased applications and require implementation of additional technological safeguards 

our investment portfolio consists of a variety of investment vehicles in a number of countries that are subject to interest rate trends market volatility and other economic factors if general economic conditions decline this could cause the credit ratings of our investments to deteriorate illiquidity in the financial marketplace and we may experience a decline in interest income and an inability to sell our investments leading to impairment in the value of our investments 

it is our policy to invest our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in highly liquid instruments with and in the custody of financial institutions with high credit ratings and to limit the amounts invested with any one institution type of security and issuer however we are subject to general economic conditions interest rate trends and volatility in the financial marketplace that can affect the income that we receive from our investments the net realizable value of our investments including our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and our ability to sell them in the us for example the yields on our portfolio securities are very low due to general economic conditions any one of these factors could reduce our investment income or result in material charges which in turn could impact our overall net income and earnings per share 

from time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies the privately held companies in which we invest are considered inherently risky the technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies 

a loss on any of our investments may cause us to record an otherthantemporary impairment charge the effect of this charge could impact our overall net income and earnings per share in any of these scenarios our liquidity may be negatively impacted which in turn may prohibit us from making investments in our business taking advantage of opportunities and potentially meeting our financial obligations as they come due

we are subject to legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries and we may be named in additional legal proceedings or become involved in regulatory inquiries in the future all of which are costly distracting to our core business and could result in an unfavorable outcome or a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or the trading price for our securities 

we are involved in legal proceedings and receive inquiries from regulatory agencies as the global economy has changed and our business has evolved we have seen an increase in litigation activity and regulatory inquiries like many other high technology companies the number and frequency of inquiries from us and foreign regulatory agencies we have received regarding our business and our business practices and the business practices of others in our industry have increased in recent years in the event that we are involved in significant disputes or are the subject of a formal action by a regulatory agency we could be exposed to costly and time consuming legal proceedings that could result in any number of outcomes any claims or regulatory actions initiated by or against us whether successful or not could result in expensive costs of defense costly damage awards injunctive relief increased costs of business fines or orders to change certain business practices significant dedication of management time diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business in any of these cases our financial results could be negatively impacted 

changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business further such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective 

for example the usbased financial accounting standards board “fasb” is currently working together with the international accounting standards board “iasb” on several projects to further align accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies who are required to follow us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” under sec regulations and those who are required to follow ifrs outside of the us these efforts by the fasb and iasb may result in different accounting principles under gaap that may result in materially different financial results for us in areas including but not limited to principles for recognizing revenue and lease accounting 

it is not clear if or when these potential changes in accounting principles may become effective whether we have the proper systems and controls in place to accommodate such changes and the impact that any such changes may have on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows in addition as we evolve and change our business and sales models we are currently unable to determine how these potential changes may impact our new models particularly in the area of revenue recognition 

we regularly invest resources to update and improve our information technology systems should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems disrupt our operations our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network and data center infrastructure technology systems and our websites for our development marketing operational support sales accounting and financial reporting activities we are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet the growing and evolving requirements of our business and customers such improvements are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or uncover problems with our existing technology systems unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in disruption in our business operations loss of revenue errors in our accounting and financial reporting or damage to our reputation 

although we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to section 404 we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting the report contains among other matters an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting 

2015 form 10k 26 

table of contents 

is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 

if our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and such weakness remains uncorrected at fiscal yearend we will be unable to assert such internal control is effective at fiscal yearend if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective at fiscal yearend or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or concludes that we have a material weakness in our internal controls we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which would likely have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 

in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements which if not accurate may significantly impact our financial results 

we make assumptions judgments and estimates for a number of items including the fair value of financial instruments goodwill longlived assets and other intangible assets the realizability of deferred tax assets and the fair value of stock awards we also make assumptions judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee related liabilities including commissions bonuses and sabbaticals and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions partner incentive programs product returns reserves allowances for doubtful accounts asset retirement obligations and legal contingencies these assumptions judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from our estimates and such differences could significantly impact our financial results 

our financial results could be negatively impacted if our tax positions are overturned by tax authorities 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions our effective tax rate is based on our expected geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany transfer pricing and enacted tax rules significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis we believe our tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 

we rely on thirdparty technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies our product and service development may be delayed and our financial results negatively impacted 

we rely on certain software that we license from third parties including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions these thirdparty software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and the software may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software can be developed identified licensed and integrated which would likely harm our business 

disruptions with licensing relationships and thirdparty developers could adversely impact our business 

we license certain key technologies from third parties licenses may be restricted in the term or the use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business similarly we may not be able to obtain or renew license agreements for key technology on favorable terms if at all and any failure to do so could harm our business 

our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with thirdparty developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn in particular markets such disruptions have in the past and would likely in the future negatively impact these thirdparty developers and end users which could harm our business 

additionally technology created by outsourced product development whether outsourced to third parties or developed externally and transferred to us through business or technology acquisitions have certain additional risks such as effective integration into existing products adequate transfer of technology knowhow and ownership and protection of transferred intellectual property

as a result of our strategy of partnering with other companies for product development our product delivery schedules could be adversely affected if we experience difficulties with our product development partners 

we partner with certain independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities we believe our partnering strategy allows us to among other things achieve efficiencies in developing new products and maintaining and enhancing existing product offerings our partnering strategy creates a dependency on such independent developers independent developers including those who currently develop products for us in the us and throughout the world may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future in addition use of development resources through consulting relationships particularly in nonus jurisdictions with developing legal systems may be adversely impacted by and expose us to risks relating to evolving employment export and intellectual property laws these risks could among other things expose our intellectual property to misappropriation and result in disruptions to product delivery schedules 

  

our business may be significantly disrupted upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event 

our business is highly automated and relies extensively on the availability of our network and data center infrastructure our internal technology systems and our websites we also rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide to our customers and computer operations for our internal use the failure of our systems or hosted computer services due to a catastrophic event such as an earthquake fire flood tsunami weather event telecommunications failure power failure cyber attack or war could adversely impact our business financial results and financial condition we have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems in order to reduce the potential impact of a catastrophic event however there can be no assurance that these plans and systems would enable us to return to normal business operations in addition any such event could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products this could in turn decrease that countrys or regions demand for our products thereby negatively impacting our financial results 

we issued  7500 million  aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a debt offering in december 2012 and have an existing  4000 million  revolving credit facility and may incur other debt in the future all of which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

in december 2012 we issued 195  notes due december 15 2017  in an aggregate principal amount of  4000 million  and 36  notes due december 15 2022  in an aggregate principal amount of  3500 million  as the december 2017 and december 2022 debt matures we will have to expend significant resources to either repay or refinance these notes if we decide to refinance the notes we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all both of which may adversely affect our financial condition 

we also have a  4000 million revolving credit facility as of january 31 2015  we had no  outstanding borrowings on the line of credit although we have no current plans to borrow under this credit facility we may use the proceeds of any future borrowing for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business our existing and future levels of indebtedness may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 

 

 

 

we are required to comply with the covenants set forth in our senior unsecured notes and revolving credit facility our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the note holders or lenders then subject to applicable cure periods any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities under certain circumstances if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility could increase downgrades in our credit ratings could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing

strategy 

autodesk’s vision is to help people imagine design and create a better world we do this by developing software and services for the world’s designers architects engineers digital artists professionals and nonprofessionals alike—the people who imagine design and create the worlds products buildings infrastructure films and games autodesk serves professional customers in three primary markets architecture engineering and construction manufacturing and digital media and entertainment 

our goal is to provide our customers with the world’s most innovative and engaging design software and services our product and services portfolio allows our customers to digitally visualize simulate and analyze their projects helping them to better understand the consequences of their design decisions save time money and resources and become more innovative 

autodesk was founded during the platform transition from mainframes and engineering workstations to personal computers we developed and sustained a compelling value proposition based upon desktop software for the personal computer just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry over 30 years ago we believe our industry is undergoing a similar transition from the personal computer to cloud social and mobile computing to address this transition we have accelerated our move to the cloud and mobile devices and are offering more flexible licensing for example in fiscal 2014 we began offering autodesk bim 360 plm 360 sim 360 and fusion 360 a few of our cloud based offerings which provide tools including social and mobile capabilities to help streamline design collaboration and data management processes we believe that customer adoption of these new offerings will continue to grow as customers across a range of industries begin to take advantage of the scalable computing power and flexibility provided through these new services 

our strategy is to lead our customers and the industries they serve to the new cloud and mobile platforms this entails both a technological shift and a business model shift during fiscal 2014 we announced more flexible termbased license offerings including termbased desktop subscriptions for certain products these offerings are designed to give our customers even more flexibility with how they use our products and service offerings and address new types of customers such as projectbased users and small businesses as part of this transition we have discontinued upgrades effective march 6 2015 on february 4 2015 we also announced that new commercial seats of most standalone software products will be available only by desktop subscription beginning february 1 2016 

2015 form 10k 34 

table of contents 

over the next three years we expect to increase our subscription base and customer value which we believe will help drive billings growth during the transition revenue deferred revenue operating margin and earnings per share will be affected as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than up front and as new offerings bring a wider variety of price points 

for fiscal 2015  our billings increased 18  as compared to the prior fiscal year the difference between our 10  yearoveryear growth in revenue and our 18  yearoveryear growth in billings represents 8  percentage points from the increase in deferred revenue primarily driven by an increase in subscription billings over the past fiscal year and the business model transition 

at january 31 2015  and january 31 2014  our total subscriptions were 223 million  and 185 million respectively subscription additions were led by maintenance subscriptions and benefited from promotional activity driving upgrades and maintenance renewals 

for the past three years suites have been an important growth area to our overall strategy as our customers in all industries adopt our design suites we believe they will experience an increase in their productivity and the value of their design data for fiscal 2015  revenue from suites increased   17  as compared to the prior fiscal year as a percentage of revenue suites increased  to 36  in fiscal 2015  as compared to 34  in fiscal 2014  

another key element of our growth strategy is increasing our global penetration much of the growth in the world’s construction and manufacturing is happening in emerging economies further emerging economies face many of the challenges that our design technology can help address including infrastructure buildout and innovative design and manufacturing in fiscal 2015  revenue from emerging economies increased   14  as compared to fiscal 2014  and represented 15  of net revenue for both fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  while we continue to believe there are longterm growth opportunities in emerging economies conducting business in these countries presents significant challenges including economic volatility geopolitical risk local competition limited intellectual property protection poorly developed business infrastructure scarcity of talent software piracy and different purchase patterns as compared to the developed world 

today complex challenges such as globalization urbanization and sustainable design are driving our customers to new levels of performance and competitiveness and we are committed to helping them address those challenges and take advantage of new opportunities to achieve these goals we are capitalizing on two of our strongest competitive advantages our ability to bring advanced technology to mainstream markets and the breadth and depth of our product portfolio 

we bring powerful new design capabilities to volume markets our products are designed to be easytolearn and use and to provide customers with a low cost of deployment a low total cost of access to our software offerings and a rapid return on investment in addition our software architecture allows for extensibility and integration with other products the breadth of our technology and product line gives us a unique competitive advantage because it allows our customers to address a wide variety of problems in ways that transcend industry and disciplinary boundaries this is particularly important in helping our customers address the complex challenges mentioned above we also believe that our technological leadership and global brand recognition have positioned us well for longterm growth and industry leadership 

in addition to the competitive advantages afforded by our technology our large global network of distributors resellers thirdparty developers customers educational institutions educators and students is a key competitive advantage this network of partners and relationships provides us with a broad and deep reach into volume markets around the world our distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with the resources to purchase deploy learn and support our products quickly and easily we have a significant number of registered thirdparty developers who create products that work well with our products and extend them for a variety of specialized applications 

 autodesk is committed to helping fuel a lifelong passion for design in students of all ages in fiscal 2014 we initiated a new program offering free educational licenses of autodesk software worldwide to students educators and educational institutions targeting both the secondary and postsecondary school markets we collaborate with educators institutions and partners that encourage design learning and further science technology engineering digital arts and math steam education initiatives our intention is to make autodesk software the ubiquitous design software of choice for those poised to become the next generation of professional users 

our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products technology and businesses acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers however they entail cost and integration challenges and may in certain instances negatively impact our operating margins we continually review these tradeoffs in making decisions 

2015 form 10k 35 

table of contents 

regarding acquisitions we currently anticipate that we will continue to acquire products technology and businesses as compelling opportunities become available 

our strategy depends upon a number of assumptions to successfully make the transition toward new cloud and mobile platforms including the related technology and business model shifts making our technology available to mainstream markets leveraging our large global network of distributors resellers thirdparty developers customers educational institutions and students improving the performance and functionality of our products and adequately protecting our intellectual property if the outcome of any of these assumptions differs from our expectations we may not be able to implement our strategy which could potentially adversely affect our business for further discussion regarding these and related risks see part i  item 1a  “ risk factors ” 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we regularly reevaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we believe that of all our significant accounting policies the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 

for multiple element arrangements containing only software and softwarerelated elements we allocate the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on our vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value vsoe is the price charged when an element is sold separately or a price set by management with the relevant authority if we do not have vsoe of an undelivered software license we defer revenue recognition on the entire sales arrangement until all elements for which we do not have vsoe are delivered if we do not have vsoe for undelivered maintenance or services the revenue for the arrangement is recognized over the longest contractual service period in the arrangement we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 

for multiple elements arrangements involving nonsoftware elements including cloud subscription services our revenue recognition policy is based upon the accounting guidance contained in asc 605 revenue recognition  for these arrangements we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the nonsoftware elements we then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group using the residual method as described above we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of revenue to be recognized in each accounting period 

we allocate the total arrangement consideration among the various elements based on a selling price hierarchy the selling price for a deliverable is based on its vsoe if available thirdparty evidence tpe if vsoe is not available or the best estimated selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available besp represents the price at which autodesk would transact for the deliverable if it were sold regularly on a standalone basis to establish besp for those elements for which neither vsoe nor tpe are available we perform a quantitative analysis of pricing data points for historical standalone transactions involving such elements for a twelvemonth period as part of this analysis we monitor and evaluate the besp against actual pricing to ensure that it continues to represent a reasonable estimate of the standalone selling price considering several other external and internal factors including but not limited to pricing and discounting practices contractually stated prices the geographies in which we offer our products and services and the type of customer ie distributor valueadded reseller and direct end user among others we analyze besp at least annually or on a more frequent basis if a significant change in our business necessitates a more timely analysis or if we experience significant variances in our selling prices 

2015 form 10k 36 

table of contents 

our assessment of likelihood of collection is also a critical factor in determining the timing of revenue recognition if we do not believe that collection is probable the revenue will be deferred until the earlier of when collection is deemed probable or payment is received 

our indirect channel model includes both a twotiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a onetiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers our product license revenue from distributors and resellers are generally recognized at the time title to our product passes to the distributor in a twotiered structure or reseller in a onetiered structure provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met this policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns among other criteria we are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers our policy also presumes that we have no significant performance obligations in connection with the sale of our product licenses by our distributors and resellers to their customers if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

as part of the indirect channel model autodesk has a partner incentive program that uses quarterly attainment monetary rewards to motivate distributors and resellers to achieve mutually agreed upon business goals in a specified time period a portion of these incentives reduce license and other revenue in the current period the remainder which relates to incentives on our subscription program is recorded as a reduction to deferred revenue in the period the maintenance transaction is billed and subsequently recognized as a reduction to maintenance revenue over the contract period these incentive balances do not require significant assumptions or judgments the reserves associated with the partner incentive program are treated on the balance sheet as either contra account receivable when due to distributors and direct resellers or accounts payable when due to indirect resellers 

marketable securities as described in note 2  “ financial instruments ” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements our investments in marketable securities are measured at the end of each reporting period and reported at fair value fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date in determining the fair value of our investments we are sometimes required to use various alternative valuation techniques inputs to valuation techniques are either observable or unobservable observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions these two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy 

 

 

 

this hierarchy requires us to minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to use observable market data if available when determining fair value this is generally true for our cash and cash equivalents and the majority of our marketable securities which we consider to be level 1 assets and level 2 assets however determining the fair value of marketable securities when observable inputs are not available level 3 requires significant judgment for example we use probability weighted discounted cash flow models in which some of the inputs are unobservable in the market to estimate the fair value of our convertible debt securities these assumptions are inherently subjective and involve significant management judgment whenever possible we use observable market data and rely on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available when determining fair value 

all of autodesk’s marketable securities are subject to a periodic impairment review we recognize an impairment charge when a decline in the fair value of its investments below the cost basis is judged to be otherthantemporary autodesk considers various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than autodesk’s cost basis the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the investee and autodesk’s intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value 

2015 form 10k 37 

table of contents 

business combinations   we allocate the fair value of the consideration transferred to the assets and liabilities acquired as well as to inprocess research and development based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the purchase price allocation requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations 

although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain examples of critical estimates used in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to 

 

 

 

 

these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and if such events occur we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities 

goodwill when we acquire a business a portion of the consideration transferred is typically allocated to acquired technology and other identifiable intangible assets such as customer relationships and developed technology the excess of the consideration transferred over the net of the acquisitiondate fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill the amounts allocated to acquired technology and other intangible assets represent our estimates of their fair values at the acquisition date we amortize the acquired technology and other intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives the estimation of acquisitiondate fair values of intangible assets and their useful lives requires us to make assumptions and judgments including but not limited to an evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as they relate to our business industry and market trends projections of future cash flows and appropriate discount rates 

we test goodwill for impairment annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment an optional assessment of qualitative factors of impairment “optional assessment” can be utilized prior to necessitating a twostep quantitative impairment test should the optional assessment be utilized for any given fiscal year qualitative factors to consider include cost factors financial performance legal regulatory contractual political business or other factors entity specific factors industry and market considerations macroeconomic conditions and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value then performing the twostep impairment test is unnecessary 

under the twostep quantitative impairment test we use discounted cash flow models that include assumptions regarding projected cash flows variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether goodwill is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge impairment charges if any result from instances where the fair values of net assets associated with goodwill are less than their carrying values as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

for our annual impairment assessment in fiscal 2015  we utilized the optional assessment for delcam which has been deemed a separate reporting unit within our manufacturing mfg operating segment based on a review of the qualitative factors described above we determined that for our delcam reporting unit it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value as a result we concluded that performing the twostep impairment test was not necessary for delcam 

we used the quantitative twostep impairment test for each of our remaining reporting units platform solutions and emerging business “pseb” mfg architecture engineering and construction aec and media and entertainment 

2015 form 10k 38 

table of contents 

“me” when applying the quantitative twostep impairment test a discounted cash flow model was used which included assumptions regarding projected cash flows based on this testing we determined that the fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying value for each of the four reporting units and therefore the goodwill of each reporting unit was not impaired during the fiscal year ended january 31 2015  

realizability of longlived assets we assess the realizability of our longlived assets and related intangible assets other than goodwill annually during the fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review significant underperformance of a business or product line relative to budget shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends and the results of past impairment reviews when such events or changes in circumstances occur we assess recoverability of these assets 

we assess   recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows we would perform a discounted cash flow analysis to assess impairments on longlived assets variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge impairment charges if any result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values 

in addition to our recoverability assessments we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our longlived assets any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made as well as in subsequent quarters 

we will continue to evaluate the values of our longlived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

income taxes we have  1851 million  of net deferred tax assets as of january 31 2015  primarily a result of tax credits net operating losses and timing differences for reserves accrued liabilities stock options deferred revenue purchased technologies and capitalized intangibles partially offset by the establishment of us deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries and valuation allowances against us and foreign deferred tax assets we perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets and believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors including intercompany transfer pricing adjustments any change in future profitability may require material adjustments to these net deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determination is made we believe our tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 

stockbased compensation  we measure stockbased compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award and recognize expense ratably over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period we estimate the fair value of certain stockbased payment awards including grants of stock options and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan using either the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model or a binomiallattice model eg monte carlo simulation model to determine the grantdate fair value of our stockbased payment awards we use a blackscholes model or the quoted stock price on the date of grant unless the awards are subject to market conditions in which case we use the monte carlo simulation model the monte carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables to estimate the probability that market conditions will be achieved these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors the riskfree interest rate for the expected term of the award and expected dividends the variables used in these models are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted as needed sharebased compensation cost for restricted stock is measured on the closing fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

legal contingencies  as described in part i  item 3  “ legal proceedings ” and part ii  item 8  note 8  “ commitments and contingencies ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters we base our loss accruals on the best information

overview of fiscal 2015   



during fiscal 2015  as compared to the prior fiscal year net revenue increased   10  gross profit increased   9  and income from operations decreased   58  contributing to the year over year decrease in income from operations during fiscal 2015  was an increase in operating expenses offset by increases in both subscription revenue and license and other revenue 

we continue to make progress on our business model transition announced in fiscal 2014  with more flexible licenses and service offerings that have ratable revenue streams as a result our net revenue for fiscal 2015  excluded approximately 87 million that was deferred as a result of the transition the 87 million related to flexible licensing arrangements with certain enterprise customers and had a particular impact on license revenue in the americas and emea geographies as well as our aec and mfg business segments 

our business experienced year over year growth in our aec mfg and pseb segments many of our major products particularly our aec suites and all of our geographic areas particularly emea this growth contributed to the year over year increase in both subscription and license and other revenue during fiscal 2015  we also experienced growth in our total subscriptions and billings during fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  primarily due to promotional activity driving upgrades and maintenance renewals in advance of the end of upgrades after fiscal 2015  

  

income from operations for fiscal 2015  was negatively impacted by increased spend as a result of the business model transition the incremental employee costs associated with acquisitions investments in our move to the cloud as well as increased spending on other key initiatives 

the reasons for these changes are discussed below under the heading “results from operations”

revenue from flagship products represented 48  and 51  of total net revenue during fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  respectively revenue from flagship products increased  by 2  as compared to the prior fiscal year revenue from suites represented 36  and 34  of total net revenue for fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  respectively and increased by 17  compared to the prior fiscal year revenue from new and adjacent products represented 16  and 14  of total net revenue during fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  respectively revenue from new and adjacent products increased by 24  as compared to fiscal 2014  

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including tech data corporation and its global affiliates collectively “tech data” tech data accounted for 25  and 24  of our consolidated net revenue during fiscal 2015  and 2014  respectively we believe our business is not substantially dependent on tech data our customers through tech data are the resellers and end users who purchase our software licenses and services should any of the agreements between tech data and us be terminated for any reason we believe the resellers and end users who currently

table of contents 

purchase our products through tech data would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue 

operating margin analysis 

income from operations decreased   58  in fiscal 2015  due to a  3346 million  or 20  increase in our operating expenses and a 678 million  or 25  increase in cost of revenue as compared to fiscal 2014  partially offsetting the increase in our spend was a  2383 million  or 10  increase in net revenue as compared to the prior fiscal year our operating margin decreased to 5  for fiscal 2015  from 13  for fiscal 2014  the increase in cost of revenue was driven by employee related expenses associated with the business model transition as well as the inclusion of delcam related costs and an increase in cloud service costs as compared to the prior fiscal year the increase in operating expenses between fiscal 2015  and 2014  was driven by higher employee related costs primarily due to increased headcount and higher commissions expense as a result of increased billings also impacting the increase in operating expenses during fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  was an increase in professional fees related to acquisition and business model transition initiatives 

further discussion regarding the cost of revenue and operating expense activities are discussed below under the heading “results of operations” 

foreign currency analysis 

we generate a significant amount of our revenue in the us japan germany france and the united kingdom total net revenue for fiscal 2015   increased   10  on an as reported basis compared to the prior fiscal year and was negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate changes during fiscal 2015  had applicable exchange rates from fiscal 2014  been in effect during fiscal 2015  and had we excluded foreign exchange hedge gains and losses from both fiscal 2014  and 2015  “on a constant currency basis” net revenue would have increased   12  compared to the prior fiscal year 

our total spend defined as cost of revenue plus operating expenses during fiscal 2015   increased   20  on an as reported basis as compared to the prior fiscal year had applicable exchange rates from fiscal 2014  been in effect during fiscal 2015  and had we excluded foreign exchange hedge gains and losses from both fiscal 2014  and 2015  total spend would have increased   21  on a constant currency basis compared to the prior fiscal year 

changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue total spend and income from operations in future periods we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on a portion of the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions but do not attempt to completely mitigate the impact of fluctuations of such foreign currency against the us dollar 

balance sheet and cash flow items 

at january 31 2015  we had  22994 million  in cash and marketable securities we completed fiscal 2015  with higher deferred revenue and accounts receivable balances as compared to the prior fiscal year our deferred revenue balance at january 31 2015  included  9368 million  of deferred subscription revenue primarily related to customer maintenance contracts which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the life of the contracts the term of our maintenance contracts is typically between one and three years our cash flow from operations increased   26  to 7081 million  as of january 31 2015  from 5635 million  at january 31 2014  we repurchased 69 million  shares of our common stock for  3724 million  during fiscal 2015  comparatively we repurchased 105 million  shares of our common stock for  4238 million  during fiscal 2014  further discussion regarding the balance sheet and cash flow activities are discussed below under the heading “liquidity and capital resources” 

business outlook 

autodesks business model is evolving we continue to assess current business offerings including introducing more flexible license and service offerings that have ratable revenue streams the accounting impact of these offerings and other business decisions are expected to result in an increase in the percentage of our ratable revenue making for a more predictable business over time while correspondingly reducing our upfront perpetual revenue stream over time we expect our business model transition to expand our customer base by eliminating higher upfront licensing costs and providing more flexibility in how customers gain access to and pay for our products we also expect our traditional perpetual license revenue to decline without a corresponding decrease in expenses over the next 12 to 24 months in the future we expect this business model transition will increase our longterm revenue growth rate by increasing total subscriptions and customer value over time

interest and other expense income net 

the following table sets forth the components of interest and other income net 



interest and other expense income net increased  328 million  during fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  primarily due to an increase in losses on our privately held strategic investments the increase in the loss on strategic investments during fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  is primarily due to otherthantemporary impairments on two of our privately held strategic investments and losses on the derivative portion of our strategic investments that are markedtomarket each period 

interest and other expense income net decreased  90 million  during fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  primarily due to interest expense resulting from the december 2012 issuance of 4000 million aggregate principal amount of 195 senior notes due december 15 2017 and 3500 million aggregate principal amount of 36 senior notes due december 15 2022 interest and investment income fluctuates based on average cash marketable securities and debt balances average maturities and interest rates 

provision for income taxes 

we account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse 

our effective tax rate was 1  and 18  during fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  respectively our effective tax rate decreased 17 percentage points from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 due to an increase in tax benefits from foreign earnings taxed at different rates in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 and increased benefit from research credits offset in part by lower tax benefits from stockbased compensation 

2015 form 10k 49 

table of contents 

our effective tax rate was 18  and 20  during fiscal 2014  and 2013  respectively our effective tax rate decreased two percentage points from fiscal 2013  to fiscal 2014  primarily due to an increase in tax benefits from foreign earnings taxed at different rates in fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  offset in part by lower tax benefits from restructuring and additional tax expense associated with uncertain tax positions and audit assessments 

our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate research credits state income taxes the tax impact of stockbased compensation accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations us manufacturers deduction closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits changes in valuation allowances and changes in tax laws including possible us tax law changes that if enacted could significantly impact how us multinational companies are taxed on foreign subsidiary earnings a significant amount of our earnings is generated by our europe and asia pacific subsidiaries our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates or we repatriate certain foreign earnings on which us taxes have not previously been provided 

at january 31 2015  we had net deferred tax assets of  1851 million  we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize these assets 

for additional information regarding our income tax provision and reconciliation of our effective rate to the federal statutory rate of 35 see note 4  “ income taxes ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

other financial information 

in addition to our results determined under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” discussed above we believe the following nongaap measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the fiscal years ended january 31 2015  2014  and 2013  our gross profit gross margin income from operations operating margin net income and diluted earnings per share on a gaap and nongaap basis were as follows in millions except for gross margin operating margin and per share data 



  

 

 

for our internal budgeting and resource allocation process and as a means to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons we use nongaap measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis these nongaap measures do not include certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results we use nongaap measures in making operating decisions because we believe those measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our earning 

2015 form 10k 50

potential and performance for management by excluding certain expenses and charges that may not be indicative of our core business operating results for the reasons set forth below we believe these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors both because 1 they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and 2 they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business this allows investors and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management compare financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the longterm performance of our core business we also use some of these measures for purposes of determining companywide incentive compensation 

there are limitations in using nongaap financial measures because nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies the nongaap financial measures included above are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results in addition they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the nongaap financial measures we compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a gaap basis as well as a nongaap basis and also by providing gaap measures in our public disclosures the presentation of nongaap financial information is meant to be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or in isolation from the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap we urge investors to review the reconciliation of our nongaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures included below and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business

our nongaap financial measures may exclude the following 

stockbased compensation expense s we exclude stockbased compensation expenses from nongaap measures primarily because they are noncash expenses and management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods moreover because of varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under fasb asc topic 718 we believe excluding stockbased compensation expenses allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies 

amortization of acquisitionrelated developed technologies and purchased intangibles we incur amortization of acquisitionrelated developed technology and purchased intangibles in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangibles is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions management finds it useful to exclude these variable charges from our cost of revenues to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well amortization of developed technologies and purchased intangible assets will recur in future periods 

goodwill impairment this is a noncash charge to writedown goodwill to fair value when there was an indication that the asset was impaired as explained above management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

restructuring charges benefits net these expenses are associated with realigning our business strategies based on current economic conditions in connection with these restructuring actions we recognize costs related to termination benefits for former employees whose positions were eliminated and the closure of facilities and cancellation of certain contracts we exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing business and operating results we believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses 

loss gain on strategic investments   we exclude gains and losses related to our strategic investments from our nongaap measures primarily because management finds it useful to exclude these variable gains and losses on these investments in assessing our financial results included in these amounts are noncash unrealized gains and losses on the derivative components and realized gains and losses on the sale or losses on the impairment of these investments we believe excluding these items is useful to investors because these excluded items do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business and these losses or gains were incurred in connection with strategic investments which do not occur regularly 

establishment of a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets this is a noncash charge to record a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets as explained above management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various cash expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

discrete tax items   we exclude the gaap tax provision including discrete items from the nongaap measure of income and include a nongaap tax provision based upon the projected annual nongaap effective tax rate discrete tax items include income tax expenses or benefits that do not relate to ordinary income from continuing operations in the current fiscal year unusual or infrequently occurring items or the tax impact of certain stockbased compensation examples of discrete tax items include but are not limited to certain changes in judgment and changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years certain costs related to business combinations certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets or changes in tax law management believes this approach assists investors in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations we believe the exclusion of these discrete tax items provides investors with useful supplemental information about the companys operational performance

income tax effects on the difference between gaap and nongaap costs and expenses   the income tax effects that are excluded from the nongaap measures relate to the tax impact on the difference between gaap and nongaap expenses primarily due to stockbased compensation amortization of purchased intangibles and restructuring charges benefits for gaap and nongaap measures 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of cash is from the sale of licenses to our products our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employeerelated expenses such as compensation and benefits as well as general operating expenses for marketing facilities and overhead costs in addition to operating expenses we also use cash to fund our stock repurchase program and invest in our growth initiatives which include acquisitions of products technology and businesses see further discussion of these items below 

at january 31 2015  our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  22994 million  and net accounts receivable of  4589 million  

in fiscal 2013 we issued  4000 million  aggregate principal amount of 195  senior notes due december 15 2017  and  3500 million  aggregate principal amount of 36  senior notes due december 15 2022  collectively the senior notes as of march 18 2015  we have  7500 million  aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding our senior notes do not contain any financial covenants in addition we have a line of credit facility that permits unsecured shortterm borrowings of up to  4000 million  the credit facility contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and two financial covenants a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio the credit facility limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness and has certain other restrictions on our activities as defined in the credit agreement as of january 31 2015  we were in compliance with the credit facility’s covenants  w e have no amounts outstanding under the credit facility as of march 18 2015  the credit facility expires in may 2018 borrowings under the credit facility and the net proceeds from the offering of the senior notes are available for general corporate purposes 

our cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally our primary commercial banking relationship is with citigroup and its global affiliates in addition citibank na an affiliate of citigroup is one of the lead lenders and agent in the syndicate of our  4000 million  line of credit 

the decrease in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities to  22994 million  at january 31 2015  from  25444 million  at january 31 2014  is primarily due to cash used for acquisitions including business combination and technology purchases the repurchase of common stock and lower proceeds from the issuance of common stock as compared to the prior fiscal year the cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock varies based on our stock price stock option exercise activity and the volume of employee purchases under the employee stock purchase plan “esp plan” these decreases to cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are partially offset by an increase in cash generated by operating activities 

the primary source for net cash provided by operating activities of  7081 million  for fiscal 2015  was net income of 818 million  increased by the effect of noncash expenses totaling 3115 million  associated with depreciation amortization accretion and stockbased compensation in addition net cash flow provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities was 2960 million  the primary working capital sources of cash were an increase in deferred revenue and accrued compensation for fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  our days sales outstanding in trade receivables was 63  at january 31 2015  compared to 66  at january 31 2014  the decrease in days sales outstanding primarily relates to improved billings linearity the primary working capital uses of cash were a decrease in income taxes payable and an increase in accounts receivable for fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  

at january 31 2015  our shortterm investment portfolio had an estimated fair value of  6158 million  and a cost basis of  6123 million  the portfolio fair value consisted of 2584 million  invested in commercial paper 1480 million  invested in corporate debt securities 1019 million  invested in certificates of deposit 379 million  invested in us government agency securities and 293 million  invested in municipal securities 

at january 31 2015   403 million  of trading securities were invested in a defined set of mutual funds as directed by the participants in our deferred compensation plan see note 6  “ deferred compensation ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

longterm cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following common stock repurchases the acquisition of businesses software products or technologies complementary to our business and capital expenditures including the purchase and implementation of internaluse software applications 

our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products technology and businesses acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers however they entail cost and integration challenges and in certain instances negatively impact our operating margins we continually review these tradeoffs in making decisions regarding acquisitions we currently anticipate that we will continue to acquire products technology and businesses as compelling opportunities become available our decision to acquire businesses or technology is dependent on our business needs the availability of suitable sellers and technology and our own financial condition 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances are concentrated in a few locations around the world with substantial amounts held outside of the us as of january 31 2015  approximately 81  of our total cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are located offshore and will fluctuate subject to business needs certain amounts held outside the us could be repatriated to the us subject to local law restrictions but under current us tax law could be subject to us income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits we have provided for the us income tax liability on foreign earnings except for foreign earnings that are considered permanently reinvested outside the us our intent is that amounts related to foreign earnings permanently reinvested outside the us will remain outside the us and we will meet our us liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings or both we regularly review our capital structure and consider a variety of potential financing alternatives and planning strategies to ensure we have the proper liquidity available in the locations in which it is needed and to fund our existing stock buyback program with cash that has not been permanently reinvested outside the us 

cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the risks detailed in part i item 1a  titled “ risk factors ” however based on our current business plan and revenue prospects we believe that our existing balances our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months 

our revenue earnings cash flows receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for which we have put in place foreign currency contracts as part of our risk management strategy see part ii item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at january 31 2015  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods

notes consist of the senior notes issued in december 2012 the senior notes consist of  4000 million  aggregate principal amount of 195  senior notes due december 15 2017  notes and  3500 million  aggregate principal amount of 36  senior notes due december 15 2022  

operating lease obligations consist primarily of obligations for facilities net of sublease income computer equipment and other equipment leases 

purchase obligations are contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services and are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on autodesk and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligations relate primarily to enterprise subscription agreements it infrastructure costs and marketing costs 

deferred compensation obligations relate to amounts held in a rabbi trust under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan see note 6  “ deferred compensation ” in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this plan 

pension obligations relate to our obligations for pension plans outside of the us see note 14  “ retirement benefit plans ” in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these obligations 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months in addition we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees including limited product warranties historically costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant but because potential future costs are highly variable we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations 

issuer purchases of equity securities 

autodesks stock repurchase program is largely to help offset the dilution from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and for such other purposes as may be in the interests of autodesk and its stockholders and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders the number of shares acquired and the timing of the purchases are based on several factors including general market conditions the volume of employee stock option exercises stock issuance the trading price of our common stock cash on hand and available in the us and company defined trading windows during the three and twelve months ended january 31 2015  we repurchased 11 million  and 69 million  shares of our common stock respectively at january 31 2015  148 million  shares remained available for repurchase under our current repurchase program approved by the board of directors this program does not have a fixed expiration date see note 9  “ stockholders equity ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of january 31 2015  we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements other than operating leases as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

foreign currency exchange risk 

our revenue earnings cash flows receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency volatility that exists as part of our ongoing business operations we utilize cash flow hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions in addition we use balance sheet hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables and payables as of january 31 2015  and 2014  we had open cash flow and balance sheet hedge contracts with future settlements within one to twelve months contracts were primarily denominated in euros japanese yen swiss francs british pounds canadian dollars and australian dollars we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes the notional amount of our option and forward contracts was  3812 million  and  5572 million  at january 31 2015  and 2014  respectively 

we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue and operating expenses of certain anticipated transactions a sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january 31 2015  indicated that a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 31 2015  and 2014  would increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by  351 million  and  79 million  respectively a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the dollar from its value at january 31 2015  would decrease the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by  165 million  a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the dollar from its value at january 31 2014  would increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by  37 million  

interest rate risk 

interest rate movements affect both the interest income we earn on our short term investments and the market value of certain longer term securities at january 31 2015  we had  15887 million  of cash equivalents and marketable securities including  6158 million  classified as shortterm marketable securities and  2730 million  classified as longterm marketable securities if interest rates were to move up by 50 or 100 basis points over a twelve month period the potential decline in fair value on our marketable securities would be  29 million  or  47 million  respectively 

other market risk 

from time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies the privately held companies in which we invest are considered inherently risky the technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

our management evaluated with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k as required by paragraph d of rule 13a15 of the exchange act based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined under rule 13a15e of the exchange act are effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended i is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and ii is accumulated and communicated to autodesk’s management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as such term is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended during the quarter ended january 31 2015  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2015  in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in the 2013 internal control—integrated framework  our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within autodesk have been detected 

in accordance with guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred our management’s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control activities of delcam plc delcam which we acquired february 6 2014 as discussed in note 5 “acquisitions” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements we have included the financial results of delcam in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition total revenues subject to delcam’s internal control over financial reporting represented 2 percent of our consolidated total revenues for the fiscal year ended january 31 2015  total assets subject to delcam’s internal control over financial reporting represented 6 percent of our consolidated total assets as of january 31 2015  

our management has concluded that as of january 31 2015  our internal control over financial reporting is effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in item 8 herein

product development and introduction 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware operating systems and software in addition our customers’ requirements and preferences rapidly evolve as do their expectations of the performance of our software to keep pace with these changes we maintain a vigorous program of new product development to address demands in the marketplace for our products 

just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry thirty years ago we believe our industry is undergoing a similar transition from the personal computer to cloud social and mobile computing to address this transition we have accelerated our move to the cloud and are offering more flexible licenses for example in fiscal 2014 we began offering bim 360 product lifecycle management “plm” and fusion 360 our cloud based offerings which provide tools including social and mobile capabilities to help streamline design collaboration and data management processes we believe that customer adoption of these new offerings will continue to grow as customers across a range of industries began to take advantage of the scalable computing power and flexibility provided through these new services 

we dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to further enhance our existing products and to create new products and technologies research and development expenditures were  6111 million  or 27  of fiscal 2014  net revenue  6000 million  or 26  of fiscal 2013  net revenue and  5665 million  or 26  of fiscal 2012  net revenue our software is primarily developed internally however we also use independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities additionally we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing or licensing products and technology from third parties we continually review these investments in an effort to ensure that we are generating sufficient revenue or gaining a competitive advantage to justify their costs 

the majority of our research and product development is performed in the united states china singapore and canada however we employ experienced software developers in many of our other locations translation and localization of our products are performed in a number of local markets principally singapore and switzerland we generally localize and translate our products into german french italian spanish russian japanese korean and simplified and traditional chinese 

we plan to continue to manage significant product development operations internationally over the next several years we believe that our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize product development lower costs and integrate local market knowledge into our development activities we continually assess the significant costs and challenges including intellectual property protection against the benefits of our international development activities 

in addition our business and our customers benefit from our relationships with a network of over 4000  thirdparty developers who develop and sell their own products that further enhance the range of integrated solutions available to our customers

marketing and sales 

we license or sell our products and services globally primarily through indirect channels consisting of distributors and resellers to a lesser extent we also transact directly with customers who are primarily large corporations our indirect channel model includes both a twotiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a onetiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers we have a network of approximately 2500  resellers and distributors worldwide for fiscal 2014  approximately 84  of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the future we employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our reseller channel with our business strategies sales through our largest distributor tech data corporation and its affiliates accounted for 24  23  and 21  of our net revenue for fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively we believe our business is not substantially dependent on tech data our customers through tech data are the resellers and end users who purchase our software licenses and services should any of the agreements between us and tech data be terminated for any reason we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue no other distributor reseller or direct customer accounted for 10 or more of our revenue 

our customerrelated operations are divided into three geographic regions the americas europe middle east and africa “emea” and asia pacific “apac” each geographic region is supported by global marketing and sales organizations these organizations develop and manage overall marketing and sales programs and work closely with a network of domestic and international sales offices fiscal 2014  net revenue in the emea americas and apac was  8518 million   37   8189 million   36  and  6032 million   27  respectively we intend to continue to make our products available in foreign languages we believe that international sales will continue to comprise the majority of our total net revenue adverse economic conditions in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue including emerging economies may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance a summary of our financial information by geographic location is found in note 13  “ segments ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements our international operations and sales subject us to a variety of risks see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion 

we also work directly with reseller and distributor sales organizations computer manufacturers other software developers and peripherals manufacturers in cooperative advertising promotions and tradeshow presentations we employ massmarketing techniques such as webcasts seminars telemarketing direct mailings advertising in business and trade journals and social media we have a worldwide user group organization and we have created online user communities dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products 

in addition to sales of new perpetual use software licenses we generate revenue through several subscriptionbased business models the largest is our maintenance program under which customers who own a perpetual use license for the most recent version of the underlying product are able to purchase maintenance that provides them with unspecified upgrades whenandifavailable and are able to download elearning courses and receive online support over a one year or multiyear maintenance service period 

we also offer more flexible termbased license offerings to our customers our subscriptionbased business models help our customers reduce upfront licensing costs provide more flexibility with how they use our products and address new categories of customers such as projectbased users and small businesses over the next few years we expect to significantly increase our subscription base and the annual value per subscription which will ultimately drive billings growth 

our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller networks the loss of or a significant reduction in business with any one of our major distributors or large resellers could harm our business see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion 

customer and reseller support 

we provide technical support and training to customers through a leveraged support model augmented by direct programs designed to address certain specific needs our customers rely primarily on the resellers and distributors from which they purchased licenses to our products for technical support however we do provide certain direct support for some of our customers we support our resellers and distributors through technical product training sales training classes the internet and telephone we also provide online support directly to our customers through our maintenance program there are also a number of user group forums in which customers are able to share information

educational programs 

we help students and educators imagine design and create a better world by granting them for little or no fees autodesk software licenses specialized learning content education communities and support networks 

we are committed to helping fuel a lifelong passion for design in students of all ages and inspiring and supporting educators as such we partner with education institutions and work to develop programs that can facilitate a passion for design in students and provide a good foundation for steam science technology engineering digital arts and math growth in the secondary school market within our secondary and postsecondary school markets we are enabling future workforces to graduate industryready and autodeskliterate with marketable software skills that are in high demand whether future professional designers or lifelong design hobbyists our full portfolio of professionalgrade and personal design products introduce students and educators at all levels to design and the power of design technology 

developer programs 

one of our key strategies is to maintain an openarchitecture design of our software products to facilitate thirdparty development of complementary products and industryspecific software solutions this approach enables customers and third parties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses we offer several programs that provide marketing sales technical support and programming tools to developers who develop addon applications for our products over 4000  developers in the autodesk developer network create interoperable products that further enhance the range of integrated solutions available to our customers 

competition 

the markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to rapid change we strive to increase our competitive separation by investing in research and development allowing us to bring new products to market and create exciting new versions of existing products that offer compelling efficiencies for our customers we also compete through investments in marketing and sales to more effectively reach new customers and better serve existing customers 

our competitors include large global publicly traded companies small geographically focused firms startup firms and solutions produced inhouse by their users our primary global competitors in the pseb aec and mfg segments include adobe systems incorporated ansys inc aveva group plc bentley systems incorporated dassault systèmes sa and its subsidiary dassault systèmes solidworks corp environmental systems research institute inc esri intergraph corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of hexagon ab msc software corporation nemetschek ag ptc 3d systems and trimble navigation limited 

our me segment also competes with a wide range of different companies from large global publiclytraded companies to small private entities large organizations that produce products that compete in some or all of our markets include adobe systems incorporated apple inc avid technology inc sony corporation and technicolor among others the media and entertainment market is highly fragmented with complex interdependencies between many of the larger businesses as a result some of our competitors also own subsidiaries that are our customers or our partners in developing or bringing to market some of our solutions in addition to traditional competitors in developed economies we encounter new competitors in emerging economies 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing power with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the industry is presently undergoing a platform shift from the personal computer to cloud and mobile computing this shift further lowers barriers to entry and poses a disruptive challenge to established software companies the design software market is characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete both from existing competitors and by entry of new competitors with innovative technologies competition is increasingly enhanced by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies and the possibility that competitors in one vertical segment may enter other vertical segments that we serve in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources than we do because of these and other factors competitive conditions in these industries are likely to continue to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which could harm our business see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion of risks regarding competition

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to better serve customers by offering new products including cloud and mobile computing products whether by internal development or acquisition and to continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to ease of use reliability performance range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation price and training 

intellectual property and licenses 

we maintain an active program to legally protect our investment in technology through intellectual property rights we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions the nature and extent of legal protection associated with each such intellectual property right depends on among other things the type of intellectual property right and the given jurisdiction in which such right arises we believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business including each of our segments 

nonetheless our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws enforcement of intellectual property rights against alleged infringers can sometimes lead to costly litigation and counterclaims our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business 

from time to time we receive claims alleging infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights including patents disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to among other things costly litigation or product shipment delays which could harm our business 

we retain ownership of software we develop all software is licensed to users and primarily provided in object code pursuant to either shrinkwrap embedded or online licenses or signed license agreements these agreements contain restrictions on duplication disclosure and transfer 

we believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our intellectual property and the rapid ongoing technological changes in both the computer hardware and software industries we must rely principally upon software engineering and marketing skills to maintain and enhance our competitive market position 

while we have recovered some revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the full extent to which piracy of our software products exists we believe however that software piracy is and can be expected to be a persistent problem that negatively impacts our revenue and financial results 

in addition through various licensing arrangements we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others we expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing arrangements in the future as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions to support continued development and sales of our products and services some of these licensing arrangements require or may require royalty payments and other licensing fees the amount of these payments and fees may depend on various factors including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments offsetting considerations if any and the degree of use of the licensed technology 

see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion of risks related to protecting our intellectual property 

production and suppliers 

the production of our pseb aec mfg and certain me software products involves duplication of the software media and for certain products the printing of user manuals the purchase of media and the transfer of the software programs onto media for distribution to customers are performed by us and by licensed subcontractors media for our products such as dvds and usb flash drives are available from multiple sources we offer our maintenance customers an electronic software download option for selected product updates customers who choose electronic fulfillment receive the latest version of the software from our vendor’s secure servers for certain products user manuals are made available by request only as we work toward reducing our cost of shipping and production as well as the use of natural resources user manuals and packaging materials are produced to our specifications by outside sources production is performed in leased facilities operated by independent thirdparty contractors to date we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the production of our software and documentation

backlog 

we typically ship products shortly after receipt of an order which is common in the software industry our backlog is comprised of current software license product orders which have not yet shipped the category of current software license product orders which we have not yet shipped consists of orders from customers with approved credit status for currently available software products and may include both orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period

risk factors 

tableend 

we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks a number of which are beyond our control in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following discussion highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on our business financial condition and future results of operations if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted causing the trading price of our common stock to decline in addition these risks and uncertainties may impact the “forwardlooking” statements described 

2014 form 10k 14 

table of contents 

elsewhere in this form 10k and in the documents incorporated herein by reference they could affect our actual results of operations causing them to differ materially from those expressed in “forwardlooking” statements 

global economic conditions may further impact our business financial results and financial condition   

as our business has expanded globally we have increasingly become subject to risks arising from adverse changes in global economic and political conditions the past several years have been characterized by weak global economic conditions a tightening in the credit markets relatively high unemployment a low level of liquidity in many financial markets increased government deficit spending and debt levels uncertainty about certain governments abilities to repay such debt or to address certain fiscal issues such as “austerity” measures in southern europe and volatility in many financial instrument markets while some recent indicators point to a slow economic recovery on the whole indicators continue to suggest a mixed trend in economic activity among the different geographical regions and markets 

over the past several years many of our customers have experienced tighter credit negative financial news and weaker financial performance of their businesses and have reduced their workforces thereby reducing the number of licenses and the number of maintenance contracts they purchase from us in addition a number of our customers rely directly and indirectly on government spending current debt balances of many countries without proportionate increases in revenues have caused many countries to reduce spending and in some cases have forced those countries to restructure their debt in an effort to avoid defaulting under those obligations this has not only impacted those countries but others that are holders of such debt and those assisting in such restructuring 

these actions may impact and over the past several years have negatively impacted our business financial results and financial condition in addition these factors are causing and over the past several years have caused us to restructure our business and in turn we have and will incur restructuring charges moreover our financial performance may be negatively impacted by 

 

 

 

 

 

even if economic conditions in the us and foreign markets improve generally a slower economic recovery in industries important to our business such as the manufacturing and digital media and entertainment industries may adversely affect our business financial results and financial condition if a macroeconomic recovery does not occur as rapidly as anticipated our ability to meet our longterm financial targets may also be adversely affected 

existing and increased competition and rapidly evolving technological changes may reduce our revenue and profits 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing devices with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the industry is presently undergoing a platform shift from the personal computer to cloud and mobile computing this shift further lowers barriers to entry and poses a disruptive challenge to established software companies the markets in which we compete are characterized by vigorous competition both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources furthermore a reduction in the number and availability of compatible thirdparty applications or our inability to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes including those related to cloud computing mobile devices and new computing platforms may adversely affect the sale of our products because of these and other factors competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which would likely harm our business

we believe that our future results largely depend upon our ability to offer products that compete favorably with respect to reliability performance ease of use range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation and price 

if we fail to successfully manage our business model transition to cloudbased products and more flexible product licenses our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

to address the industry transition from personal computer to cloud social and mobile computing we have accelerated our move to the cloud and are offering more flexible product licenses while we expect to increase our subscription base value per subscription billings bookings ratable and recurring revenue over time as a result of this business model transition our ability to achieve these financial objectives is subject to risks and uncertainties the new offerings require a considerable investment of technical financial legal and sales resources and a scalable organization market acceptance of such offerings is affected by a variety of factors including but not limited to security reliability performance current license terms customer preference socialcommunity engagement customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage their data public concerns regarding privacy and the enactment of restrictive laws or regulations whether our business model transition will prove successful and will accomplish our business and financial objectives is subject to numerous uncertainties including but not limited to customer demand attach and renewal rates channel acceptance our ability to further develop and scale infrastructure our ability to include functionality and usability in such offerings that address customer requirements tax and accounting implications pricing and our costs in addition the metrics we use to gauge the status of our business model transition may evolve over the course of the transition as significant trends emerge if we are unable to successfully establish these new offerings and navigate our business model transition in light of the foregoing risks and uncertainties our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

our strategy to develop and introduce new products and services exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance costs related to product defects and large expenditures that may not result in additional net revenue or could result in decreased net revenue 

rapid technological changes as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences characterize the software industry just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry 30 years ago we believe our industry is undergoing a similar transition from the personal computer to cloud mobile and social computing customers are also reconsidering the manner in which they license software products which requires us to constantly evaluate our business model and strategy in response we are focused on providing solutions to enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative on their projects we are also developing consumer products for digital art personal design and creativity and home design we devote significant resources to the development of new technologies in addition we frequently introduce new business models or methods that require a considerable investment of technical and financial resources such as an increase in our portfolio of and focus on suites and most recently our introduction of flexible license and service offerings we are making such investments through further development and enhancement of our existing products and services as well as through acquisitions of new product lines such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs and could result in decreased net revenue if we are not able to meet customer requirements either with respect to our software products or the manner in which we provide such products or if we are not able to adapt our business model to meet our customers requirements our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted 

in particular a critical component of our growth strategy is to have customers of our autocad and autocad lt products expand their portfolios to include our suites and cloudbased services over time we aim to migrate customers using standalone autodesk products to expand their portfolio with our suites and cloudbased offerings at times sales of licenses of our autocad and autocad lt or standalone autodesk flagship products have decreased without a corresponding increase in suites product or cloudbased services revenue or without purchases of customer seats to our suites should this continue our results of operations will be adversely affected also adoption of our cloud and mobile computing offerings and changes in the delivery of our software and services to our customers such as desktop subscription formally referred to as rental offerings will change the way in which we recognize revenue relating to our software and services with a potential negative impact on our financial performance the accounting impact of these offerings and other business decisions are expected to result in an increase in the percentage of our ratable revenue as well as recurring revenue making for a more predictable business over time while correspondingly reducing our upfront perpetual revenue stream additionally the software products we offer are complex and despite extensive testing and quality control may contain errors or defects these errors or defects could result in the need for corrective releases to our software products damage to our reputation loss of revenue an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products any of which would likely harm our business

further given the rapid speed of changing customer expectations and advancement of technology inherent in the software industry the extensive and complex efforts required to create useful and widely accepted products and the rapid evolution of cloud computing mobile devices new computing platforms and other technologies such as consumer products our executive management team must act quickly continuously and with vision although we have articulated a strategy that we believe will fulfill these challenges if we fail to execute properly on that strategy adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve or fail to internalize and execute on that strategy we may fail to meet our customers expectations fail to compete with our competitors products and technology and lose the confidence of our channel partners and employees this in turn could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

we are dependent on international revenue and operations exposing us to significant regulatory global economic intellectual property collections currency exchange rate taxation political instability and other risks which could adversely impact our financial results 

we are dependent on our international operations for a significant portion of our revenue international net revenue represented 70  and 71  of our net revenue in fiscal 2014  and 2013  respectively our international revenue including that from emerging economies is subject to general economic and political conditions in foreign markets including conditions in foreign markets resulting from economic and political conditions in the us our revenue is also impacted by the relative geographical and country mix of our revenue over time these factors have recently adversely impacted and may in the future adversely impact our international revenue and consequently our business as a whole our dependency on international revenue makes us much more exposed to global economic and political trends which can negatively impact our financial results even if our results in the us are strong for a particular period further a significant portion of our earnings from our international operations may not be freely transferable to the us due to remittance restrictions adverse tax consequences or other factors our intent is that amounts related to foreign earnings permanently reinvested outside the us will remain outside the us and we will meet our us liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings such as our senior notes or both however if in the future amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are needed to fund our operations in the us or to service our external borrowings the repatriation of such amounts to the us could result in a significant incremental tax liability in the period in which the decision to repatriate occurs and payment of any such tax liability would reduce the cash available to fund our operations 

we anticipate that our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue and as we expand our international development sales and marketing expertise will provide significant support to our overall efforts in countries outside of the us risks inherent in our international operations include fluctuating currency exchange rates including risks related to any hedging activities we undertake unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and practices delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology tariffs quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions transportation delays operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices particularly in emerging economies increasing enforcement by the us under the foreign corrupt practices act adoption of stricter anticorruption laws in certain countries including the united kingdom difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales and development operations longer collection cycles for accounts receivable potential changes in tax laws including possible us and foreign tax law changes that if enacted could significantly impact how multinational companies are taxed tax arrangements with foreign governments including our ability to meet and review the terms of those tax arrangements and laws regarding the management of and access to data and public networks possible future limitations upon foreign owned businesses increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities inadequate local infrastructure greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property and other factors beyond our control including popular uprisings terrorism war natural disasters and diseases 

some of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks 

our financial results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenue and financial results difficult to predict 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so in the future these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines in addition to the other factors described in this part i  item 1a  some of the factors that could cause our financial results to fluctuate include

we have also experienced fluctuations in financial results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic conditions in particular our financial results in europe during our third quarter are usually affected by a slower summer period and our asia pacific operations typically experience seasonal slowing in our third and fourth quarters 

  

our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenue and are relatively fixed in the short term accordingly any revenue shortfall below expectations have had and in the future could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability greater than anticipated expenses or a failure to maintain rigorous cost controls would also negatively affect profitability 

our business could suffer as a result of risks costs and charges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments such as our fiscal 2015 acquisition of delcam plc “delcam” 

we regularly acquire or invest in businesses software products and technologies that are complementary to our business through acquisitions strategic alliances or equity or debt investments for example we recently acquired delcam a leading supplier of advanced cadcam and industrial measurement solutions for the manufacturing industry the risks associated with such acquisitions include among others the difficulty of assimilating products operations and personnel inheriting liabilities such as intellectual property infringement claims the failure to realize anticipated revenue and cost projections the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business in accordance with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the diversion of managements time and attention 

in addition such acquisitions and investments involve other risks such as

table of contents 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may not be successful in overcoming such risks and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business in addition such acquisitions and investments have in the past and may in the future contribute to potential fluctuations in our quarterly financial results these fluctuations could arise from transactionrelated costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or writeoffs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments these costs or charges could negatively impact our financial results for a given period cause quarter to quarter variability in our financial results or negatively impact our financial results for several future periods 

if we do not maintain good relationships with the members of our distribution channel or achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected if our distribution channel suffers financial losses becomes financially unstable or insolvent or is not provided the right mix of incentives to sell our products our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected 

we sell our software products both directly to endusers and through a network of distributors and resellers for fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  approximately 84  and 83  respectively of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the future our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller network computer software distributors and resellers typically are not highly capitalized have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and experienced difficulties during the past several years we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of distributors and resellers prior to our sales to them in the past we have taken steps to support them and may take additional steps in the future such as extending credit terms and providing temporary discounts these steps if taken could harm our financial results if our distributors and resellers were to become insolvent they would not be able to maintain their business and sales or provide customer support services which would negatively impact our business and revenue 

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including the distributor tech data corporation and its global affiliates “tech data” tech data accounted for 24  and 23  of our total net revenue for fiscal 2014  and 2013  respectively although we believe that we are not substantially dependent on tech data if tech data were to experience a significant disruption with its business or if our relationship with tech data were to significantly deteriorate it is possible that our ability to sell to end users would be at least temporarily negatively impacted this could in turn negatively impact our financial results 

over time we have modified and will continue to modify aspects of our relationship with our distributors and resellers such as their incentive programs pricing to them and our distribution model to motivate and reward them for aligning their businesses with our strategy and business objectives changes in these relationships and underlying programs could negatively impact their business and harm our business in addition the loss of or a significant reduction in business with those distributors or resellers or the failure to achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough with any one of our major international distributors or large resellers could harm our business in particular if one or more of such distributors or resellers were unable to meet their obligations with respect to accounts payable to us we could be forced to write off such accounts and may be required to delay the recognition of revenue on future sales to these customers these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

because we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from a small number of products including our autocadbased software products and suites if these products are not successful our revenue will be adversely affected 

2014 form 10k 20 

table of contents 

we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from sales of licenses of a limited number of our products including autocad software products based on autocad which include our suites that serve specific markets upgrades to those products and products that are interoperable with autocad any factor adversely affecting sales of these products including the product release cycle market acceptance product competition performance and reliability reputation price competition economic and market conditions and the availability of thirdparty applications would likely harm our financial results during fiscal 2014  and 2013  combined revenue from our autocad and autocad lt products not including suites having autocad or autocad lt as a component represented 30  and 33  of our total net revenue respectively 

a significant portion of our revenue is generated through maintenance revenue decreases in maintenance attach or renewal rates or a decrease in the number of new licenses we sell would negatively impact our future revenue and financial results 

our maintenance customers have no obligation to attach maintenance to their initial license or renew their maintenance contract after the expiration of their initial maintenance period which is typically one year our customers attach and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the overall global economy the health of their businesses and the perceived value of the maintenance program if our customers do not attach maintenance to their initial license or renew their maintenance contract for our products our maintenance revenue will decline and our financial results will suffer 

in addition a portion of the growth of our maintenance revenue has typically been associated with growth of the number of licenses that we sell any reduction in the number of licenses that we sell even if our customers attach rates do not change will have a negative impact on our future maintenance revenue this in turn would impact our business and harm our financial results 

we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the term of the maintenance contracts which is predominantly one year but may also range up to five years decreases in net maintenance billings will negatively impact future maintenance revenue however future maintenance revenue will also be impacted by other factors such as the amount timing and mix of contract terms of future billings 

our restructuring and cost reduction actions may not be as effective as anticipated 

during fiscal years 2013 and 2014 we undertook restructuring plans if we are unable to realize the outcomes from the restructuring efforts as planned we may need to undertake additional restructuring efforts and our business and operating results may be harmed in taking any future restructuring actions we may incur additional costs that negatively impact our operating margins additionally a prolonged and slow economic recovery or a renewed recession in us or foreign markets could also lead to additional restructuring actions and associated costs 

in the past we have taken actions to reduce our cost structure to more closely align our costs with our revenue levels in taking these actions we have attempted to balance the cost of such initiatives against their longer term benefits if we do not achieve the proper balance of these cost reduction initiatives we may eliminate critical elements of our operations the loss of which could negatively impact our ability to benefit from an economic recovery we cannot assure that our cost cutting efforts will achieve appropriate levels of expenses and we may take additional actions in the future 

  

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the us and we make certain business and resource decisions based on assumptions about foreign currency we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 

we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our cash flow exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as part of our risk management strategy we use foreign currency contracts to manage a portion of our exposures of underlying assets liabilities and other obligations which exist as part of our ongoing business operations these foreign currency instruments have maturities that extend for one to twelve months in the future and provide us with some protection against currency exposures however our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be completely successful resulting in an adverse impact on our financial results 

the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period although our foreign currency cash flow hedge program extends beyond the current 

2014 form 10k 21 

table of contents 

quarter in order to reduce our exposure to foreign currency volatility we do not attempt to completely mitigate this risk and in any case will incur transaction fees in adopting such hedging programs such volatility even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings 

net revenue or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline 

the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including the other factors described in this part i  item 1a  and the following 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant changes in the price of our common stock could expose us to additional costly and timeconsuming litigation historically after periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities a company becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts managements attention and resources 

from time to time we realign or introduce new business and sales initiatives if we fail to successfully execute and manage these initiatives our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

as part of our effort to accommodate our customers needs and demands and the rapid evolution of technology we from time to time evolve our business and sales initiatives such as realigning our development and marketing organizations and expanding our portfolio of suites and our offering of software as a service and realigning our internal resources in an effort to improve efficiency specifically during fiscal 2013 we undertook organizational changes in order to address major business initiatives including our desire to accelerate our move to the cloud transform our customers experience increase industry focus to meet customer demands and develop more effective marketing these reorganizational efforts included changes to the structure and alignment of our product development and marketing teams and reorganization of our sales teams by industry we may take such actions without clear indications that they will prove successful and at times we have been met with shortterm challenges in the execution of such initiatives market acceptance of any new business or sales initiative is dependent on our ability to match our customers needs at the right time and price often we have limited prior experience and operating history in these new areas of emphasis if any of our assumptions about expenses revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated and our financial results will be negatively impacted 

a breach of security in our products or computer systems may compromise the integrity of our products harm our reputation create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results 

2014 form 10k 22 

table of contents 

we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our product source code and computer systems the risk of a security breach or disruption particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyber terrorists has increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased these threats include but are not limited to identity theft unauthorized access dns attacks wireless network attacks viruses and worms advanced persistent threat apt application centric attacks peertopeer attacks phishing backdoor trojans and distributed denial of service ddos attacks any of the foregoing could attack our products and computer systems despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such programs it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk like all software products our software is vulnerable to cyber attacks in the past hackers have targeted our software and they may do so in the future the impact of cyber attacks could disrupt the proper functioning of our software products cause errors in the output of our customers work allow unauthorized access to sensitive proprietary or confidential information of ours or our customers and other destructive outcomes m oreover as we continue to invest in new lines of consumer products and services we are exposed to increased security risks and the potential for unauthorized access to or improper use of the information of our consumer users if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation may suffer customers may stop buying our products we could face lawsuits and potential liability and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

we rely on thirdparties to provide us with a number of operational services including hosting and delivery and certain of our customer services and other operations any interruption or delay in service from these third parties breaches of security or privacy or failures in data collection could expose us to liability harm our reputation and adversely impact our financial performance 

we rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide our customers and computer operations for our internal use as we gather customer data and host certain customer data in thirdparty facilities a security breach could compromise the integrity or availability or result in the theft of customer data in addition our operations could be negatively affected in the event of a security breach and we could be subject to the loss or theft of confidential or proprietary information including source code 

unauthorized access to this data may be obtained through breakins breaches of our secure networks by unauthorized parties employee theft or misuse or other misconduct we rely on a number of third party suppliers in the operation of our business for the provision of various services and materials that we use in the operation of our business and production of our products although we seek to diversify our third party suppliers we may from time to time rely on a single or limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country for these services or materials the inability of such third parties to satisfy our requirements could disrupt our business operations or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy if any of these situations were to occur our reputation could be harmed we could be subject to third party liability including under data protection and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

  

if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights our business could be harmed 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright and trademark laws trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software products or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our software products is timeconsuming and costly while we have recovered some revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists and we expect that software piracy will remain a persistent problem particularly in emerging economies furthermore our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 

additionally we actively protect the secrecy of our confidential information and trade secrets including our source code if unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code the loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for thirdparties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our financial performance and our reputation we also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of nondisclosure agreements with our customers contractors vendors and partners however it is possible that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization if this were to occur it may be difficult andor costly for us to enforce our rights and our financial performance and reputation could be negatively impacted

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in the loss of significant rights 

as more software patents are granted worldwide the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims infringement or misappropriation claims have in the past been and may in the future be asserted against us and any such assertions could harm our business additionally certain patent holders without products have become more aggressive in threatening and pursuing litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents any such claims or threats whether with or without merit have been and could in the future be timeconsuming to defend result in costly litigation and diversion of resources cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in addition such royalty or license agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms if at all which would likely harm our business 

our investment portfolio is composed of a variety of investment vehicles in a number of countries that are subject to interest rate trends market volatility and other economic factors if general economic conditions decline this could cause the credit ratings of our investments to deteriorate illiquidity in the financial marketplace and we may experience a decline in interest income and an inability to sell our investments leading to impairment in the value of our investments 

it is our policy to invest our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in highly liquid instruments with and in the custody of financial institutions with high credit ratings and to limit the amounts invested with any one institution type of security and issuer however we are subject to general economic conditions interest rate trends and volatility in the financial marketplace that can affect the income that we receive from our investments the net realizable value of our investments including our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and our ability to sell them in the us for example the yields on our portfolio securities are very low due to general economic conditions any one of these factors could reduce our investment income or result in material charges which in turn could impact our overall net income and earnings per share 

from time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies the privately held companies in which we invest are considered inherently risky the technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies 

if we were to experience a loss on any of our investments that loss may cause us to record an otherthantemporary impairment charge the effect of this charge could impact our overall net income and earnings per share in any of these scenarios our liquidity may be negatively impacted which in turn may prohibit us from making investments in our business taking advantage of opportunities and potentially meeting our financial obligations as they come due 

we are subject to legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries and we may be named in additional legal proceedings or become involved in regulatory inquiries in the future all of which are costly distracting to our core business and could result in an unfavorable outcome or a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or the trading price for our securities 

we are involved in legal proceedings and receive inquiries from regulatory agencies as the global economy has changed and our business has evolved we have seen an increase in litigation activity and regulatory inquiries like many other high technology companies the number and frequency of inquiries from us and foreign regulatory agencies we have received regarding our business and our business practices and the business practices of others in our industry have increased in recent years in the event that we are involved in significant disputes or are the subject of a formal action by a regulatory agency we could be exposed to costly and time consuming legal proceedings that could result in any number of outcomes although outcomes of such actions vary any claims or regulatory actions initiated by or against us whether successful or not could result in expensive costs of defense costly damage awards injunctive relief increased costs of business fines or orders to change certain business practices significant dedication of management time diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business in any of these cases our financial results could be negatively impacted 

although we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

2014 form 10k 24 

table of contents 

pursuant to section 404 we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting the report contains among other matters an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 

although we have determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 31 2014  as indicated in our management report on internal control over financial reporting included in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended january 31 2014 we must continue to monitor and assess our internal control over financial reporting if our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and such weakness remains uncorrected at fiscal yearend we will be unable to assert such internal control is effective at fiscal yearend if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective at fiscal yearend or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or concludes that we have a material weakness in our internal controls we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which would likely have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 

in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements which if not accurate may significantly impact our financial results 

we make assumptions judgments and estimates for a number of items including the fair value of financial instruments goodwill longlived assets and other intangible assets the realizability of deferred tax assets and the fair value of stock awards we also make assumptions judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee related liabilities including commissions bonuses and sabbaticals and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions partner incentive programs product returns reserves allowances for doubtful accounts asset retirement obligations and legal contingencies these assumptions judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from our estimates and such differences could significantly impact our financial results 

changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business further such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective 

for example the usbased financial accounting standards board “fasb” is currently working together with the international accounting standards board “iasb” on several projects to further align accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies who are required to follow us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” under sec regulations and those who are required to follow ifrs outside of the us these efforts by the fasb and iasb may result in different accounting principles under gaap that may result in materially different financial results for us in areas including but not limited to principles for recognizing revenue and lease accounting 

it is not clear if or when these potential changes in accounting principles may become effective whether we have the proper systems and controls in place to accommodate such changes and the impact that any such changes may have on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows in addition as we evolve and change our business and sales models we are currently unable to determine how these potential changes may impact our new models particularly in the area of revenue recognition 

changes in laws andor regulations related to the internet or related to privacy and data security concerns may impact our business or expose us to increased liability 

the future success of our business depends upon the continued use of the internet as a primary medium for commerce communication and business applications federal state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws or regulations affecting data privacy and the transmission of certain types of content using the internet for example the state of california has adopted legislation requiring operators of commercial websites and mobile applications that collect personal information from california residents to conspicuously post and comply with privacy policies that satisfy certain requirements several other us states have adopted legislation requiring companies to protect the security 

2014 form 10k 25 

table of contents 

of personal information that they collect from consumers over the internet and more states may adopt similar legislation in the future additionally the federal trade commission has used its authority under section 5 of the federal trade commission act to bring actions against companies for failing to maintain adequate security for personal information collected from consumers over the internet and for failing to comply with privacyrelated representations made to internet users the us congress has at various times proposed federal legislation intended to protect the privacy of internet users and the security of personal information collected from internet users that would impose additional compliance burdens upon companies collecting personal information from internet users and the us congress may adopt such legislation in the future the european union also has adopted various directives regulating data privacy and security and the transmission of content using the internet involving residents of the european union including those directives known as the data protection directive the eprivacy directive and the privacy and electronic communications directive and may adopt similar directives in the future several other countries including canada and several latin american and asian countries have constitutional protections for or have adopted legislation protecting individuals personal information additionally some federal state or foreign governmental bodies have established laws which seek to censor the transmission of certain types of content over the internet or require that individuals be provided with the ability to permanently delete all electronic personal information such as the german multimedia law of 1997 

given the variety of global privacy and data protection regimes it is possible we may find ourselves subject to inconsistent obligations for instance the usa patriot act is considered by some to be in conflict with certain directives of the european union situations such as these require that we make prospective determinations regarding compliance with conflicting regulations increased enforcement of existing laws and regulations as well as any laws regulations or changes that may be adopted or implemented in the future could limit the growth of the use of public cloud applications or communications generally result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internetbased applications and require implementation of additional technological safeguards 

our financial results could be negatively impacted if our tax positions are overturned by tax authorities 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions our effective tax rate is based on our expected geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany transfer pricing and enacted tax rules significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis we believe our tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 

our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our success and ability to invest and grow depend largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical professional managerial sales and marketing personnel historically competition for these key personnel has been intense the loss of services of any of our key personnel including key personnel joining our company through acquisitions the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions and financial goals 

we rely on third party technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies our product and service development may be delayed and our financial results negatively impacted 

we rely on certain software that we license from third parties including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions these thirdparty software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and the software may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software can be developed identified licensed and integrated which would likely harm our business 

disruptions with licensing relationships and third party developers could adversely impact our business 

we license certain key technologies from third parties licenses may be restricted in the term or the use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business similarly we may not be able to obtain or renew license agreements for key technology on favorable terms if at all and any failure to do so could harm our business 

2014 form 10k 26 

table of contents 

our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with thirdparty developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn in particular markets such disruptions have in the past and would likely in the future negatively impact these thirdparty developers and end users which could harm our business 

additionally technology created by outsourced product development whether outsourced to third parties or developed externally and transferred to us through business or technology acquisitions have certain additional risks such as effective integration into existing products adequate transfer of technology knowhow and ownership and protection of transferred intellectual property 

as a result of our strategy of partnering with other companies for product development our product delivery schedules could be adversely affected if we experience difficulties with our product development partners 

we partner with certain independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities we believe our partnering strategy allows us to among other things achieve efficiencies in developing new products and maintaining and enhancing existing product offerings our partnering strategy creates a dependency on such independent developers independent developers including those who currently develop products for us in the us and throughout the world may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future in addition use of development resources through consulting relationships particularly in nonus jurisdictions with developing legal systems may be adversely impacted by and expose us to risks relating to evolving employment export and intellectual property laws these risks could among other things expose our intellectual property to misappropriation and result in disruptions to product delivery schedules 

  

we regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems disrupt our operations our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network and data center infrastructure internal technology systems and our websites for our development marketing operational support sales accounting and financial reporting activities we are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet the growing requirements of our business and customers such improvements are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or uncover problems with our existing technology systems unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in disruption in our business operations loss of revenue errors in our accounting and financial reporting or damage to our reputation 

our business may be significantly disrupted upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event 

our business is highly automated and relies extensively on the availability of our network and data center infrastructure our internal technology systems and our websites we also rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide to our customers and computer operations for our internal use the failure of our systems or hosted computer services due to a catastrophic event such as an earthquake fire flood tsunami weather event telecommunications failure power failure cyber attack or war could adversely impact our business financial results and financial condition we have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems in order to reduce the potential impact of a catastrophic event however there can be no assurance that these plans and systems would enable us to return to normal business operations in addition any such event could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products this could in turn decrease that countrys or regions demand for our products thereby negatively impacting our financial results 

we issued  7500 million  aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a debt offering in december 2012 and have an existing  4000 million  revolving credit facility and may incur other debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

in december 2012 we issued 195  notes due december 15 2017  in an aggregate principal amount of  4000 million  and 36  notes due december 15 2022  in an aggregate principal amount of  3500 million  as the december 2017 and december 2022 debt matures we will have to expend significant resources to either repay or refinance these notes if we decide to refinance the notes we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all both of which may adversely affect our financial condition

we also have a  4000 million revolving credit facility as of january 31 2014  we had no  outstanding borrowings on the line of credit although we have no current plans to borrow under this credit facility we may use the proceeds of any future borrowing for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business our existing and future levels of indebtedness may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 

 

 

 

we are required to comply with the covenants set forth in our senior unsecured notes and revolving credit facility our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the noteholders or lenders then subject to applicable cure periods any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our securities under certain circumstances if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility could increase downgrades in our credit ratings could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing

strategy 

autodesk’s vision is to help people imagine design and create a better world we do this by developing software and services for the world’s designers architects engineers and digital artists professionals and nonprofessionals alike—the people who create the worlds products buildings infrastructure films and games autodesk serves professional customers in three primary markets architecture engineering and construction manufacturing and digital media and entertainment 

our goal is to provide our customers with the world’s most innovative and engaging design software and services our product and services portfolio allows our customers to digitally visualize simulate and analyze their projects helping them to better understand the consequences of their design decisions save time money and resources and become more innovative 

autodesk was founded during the platform transition from mainframes and engineering workstations to personal computers we developed and sustained a compelling value proposition based upon desktop software for the personal computer just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry thirty years ago we believe our industry is undergoing a similar transition from the personal computer to cloud social and mobile computing to address this transition we have accelerated our move to the cloud and are offering more flexible licenses 

our strategy is to lead our customers and the industries they serve to the new cloud and mobile platforms this entails both a technological shift and a business model shift during the early part of fiscal 2014 we announced more flexible termbased license offerings for certain products these offerings are designed to give our customers even more flexibility with how they use our products and service offerings and address new types of customers such as projectbased users and small businesses over the next four years we expect to significantly increase our subscription base and the annual value of our subscriptions which we believe will help drive billings growth during this transition revenue deferred revenue operating margin and eps will be impacted as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than up front and as new offerings bring a wider variety of price points 

our strategy is predicated upon our major business initiatives to grow transform and expand our business

table of contents 

our customers including flexible license and service offerings product suites and cloud and socialbased services to better match the business needs of our customers we will continue to emphasize developing relationships with large global customers and pursuing opportunities in emerging economies 

 

 

we believe suites present a meaningful growth opportunity and is an important part of our overall strategy as our customers in all industries adopt our design suites we believe they will experience an increase in their productivity and the value of their design data for fiscal 2014  revenue from suites increased   15  as compared to the prior fiscal year as a percentage of revenue suites increased  to 34  in fiscal 2014  as compared to 29  in fiscal 2013  

expanding our geographic coverage is another key element of our growth strategy much of the growth in the world’s construction and manufacturing is happening in emerging economies further emerging economies face many of the challenges that our design technology can help address including infrastructure buildout and innovative design and manufacturing although revenue from emerging countries remained flat during fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  we believe that emerging economies continue to present longterm growth opportunities for us revenue from emerging countries represented 15  and 14  of fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  net revenue respectively while we believe there are longterm growth opportunities in emerging economies conducting business in these countries presents significant challenges including economic volatility geopolitical risk local competition intellectual property protection poorly developed business infrastructure scarcity of talent software piracy and different purchase patterns as compared to the developed world 

today complex challenges such as globalization urbanization and sustainable design are driving our customers to new levels of performance and competitiveness and we are committed to helping them address those challenges and take advantage of new opportunities to achieve these goals we are capitalizing on two of our strongest competitive advantages our ability to bring advanced technology to mainstream markets and the breadth and depth of our product portfolio 

by innovating within existing technology categories we bring powerful new design capabilities to volume markets our products are designed to be easytolearn and use and to provide customers with a low cost of deployment a low total cost of access to our software offerings and a rapid return on investment in addition our software architecture allows for extensibility and integration with other products the breadth of our technology and product line gives us a unique competitive advantage because it allows our customers to address a wide variety of problems in ways that transcend industry and disciplinary boundaries this is particularly important in helping our customers address the complex challenges mentioned above we also believe that our technological leadership and global brand recognition have positioned us well for longterm growth and industry leadership 

in addition to the competitive advantages afforded by our technology our large global network of distributors resellers thirdparty developers customers educational institutions faculty and students is a key competitive advantage this network of relationships provides us with a broad and deep reach into volume markets around the world our distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with the resources to purchase deploy learn and support our products quickly and easily we have a significant number of registered thirdparty developers who create products that work well with our products and extend them for a variety of specialized applications 

we are committed to helping fuel a lifelong passion for design in students of all ages and inspiring and supporting educators as such we offer extensive educational programs supporting our software and services including a new program initiated in fiscal 2014 under which we grant software licenses to educational institutions in select regions and to key partners for little or no fees through these programs we intend to further science technology engineering digital arts and math

steam education initiatives with an extensive global community of students who are experienced with our software and poised to become the next generation of professional users our goal is to reduce the cost of training and education of new talent for our customers 

our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products technology and businesses acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers however they entail cost and integration challenges and may in certain instances negatively impact our operating margins we continually review these tradeoffs in making decisions regarding acquisitions we currently anticipate that we will continue to acquire products technology and businesses as compelling opportunities become available 

our strategy depends upon a number of assumptions including that we will be able to continue making our technology available to mainstream markets leverage our large global network of distributors resellers thirdparty developers customers educational institutions and students improve the performance and functionality of our products and adequately protect our intellectual property if the outcome of any of these assumptions differs from our expectations we may not be able to implement our strategy which could potentially adversely affect our business for further discussion regarding these and related risks see part i  item 1a  “ risk factors ” 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we regularly reevaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we believe that of all our significant accounting policies the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 

for multiple element arrangements containing only software and softwarerelated elements we allocate the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on our vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value vsoe is the price charged when an element is sold separately or a price set by management with the relevant authority if we do not have vsoe of an undelivered software license we defer revenue recognition on the entire sales arrangement until all elements for which we do not have vsoe are delivered if we do not have vsoe for undelivered maintenance or services the revenue for the arrangement is recognized over the longest contractual service period in the arrangement we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 

for multiple elements arrangements involving nonsoftware elements including cloud subscription services our revenue recognition policy is based upon the accounting guidance contained in asc 605 revenue recognition  for these arrangements we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the nonsoftware elements we then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group using the residual method as described above we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of revenue to be recognized in each accounting period 

our assessment of likelihood of collection is also a critical factor in determining the timing of revenue recognition if we do not believe that collection is probable the revenue will be deferred until the earlier of when collection is deemed probable or payment is received 

our indirect channel model includes both a twotiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a onetiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers our product license revenue from distributors and resellers are generally recognized at the time title to our product passes to the distributor in a twotiered structure or reseller in a onetiered 

2014 form 10k 35 

table of contents 

structure provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met this policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns among other criteria we are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers our policy also presumes that we have no significant performance obligations in connection with the sale of our product licenses by our distributors and resellers to their customers if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

as part of the indirect channel model autodesk has a partner incentive program that uses quarterly attainment monetary rewards to motivate distributors and resellers to achieve mutually agreed upon business goals in a specified time period a portion of these incentives reduce license and other revenue in the current period the remainder which relates to incentives on our subscription program is recorded as a reduction to deferred revenue in the period the maintenance transaction is billed and subsequently recognized as a reduction to maintenance revenue over the contract period these incentive balances do not require significant assumptions or judgments the reserves associated with the partner incentive program are treated on the balance sheet as either contra account receivable when due to distributors and direct resellers or accounts payable when due to indirect resellers 

marketable securities as described in note 2  “ financial instruments ” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements our investments in marketable securities are measured at the end of each reporting period and reported at fair value fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date in determining the fair value of our investments we are sometimes required to use various alternative valuation techniques inputs to valuation techniques are either observable or unobservable observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions these two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy 

 

 

 

this hierarchy requires us to minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to use observable market data if available when determining fair value this is generally true for our cash and cash equivalents and the majority of our marketable securities which we consider to be level 1 assets and level 2 assets however determining the fair value of marketable securities when observable inputs are not available level 3 requires significant judgment for example we use probability weighted discounted cash flow models in which some of the inputs are unobservable in the market to estimate the fair value of our convertible debt securities these assumptions are inherently subjective and involve significant management judgment whenever possible we use observable market data and rely on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available when determining fair value 

all of autodesk’s marketable securities are subject to a periodic impairment review we recognize an impairment charge when a decline in the fair value of its investments below the cost basis is judged to be otherthantemporary autodesk considers various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than autodesk’s cost basis the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the investee and autodesk’s intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value 

business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the assets and liabilities acquired as well as to inprocess research and development based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill the allocation of the purchase price allocation requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations 

although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain examples 

2014 form 10k 36 

table of contents 

of critical estimates used in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to 

 

 

 

 these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and if different estimates were used the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made in addition unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates and if such events occur we may be required to record a charge against the value ascribed to an acquired asset or an increase in the amounts recorded for assumed liabilities 

goodwill when we acquire a business a portion of the purchase consideration is typically allocated to acquired technology and other identifiable intangible assets such as customer relationships and developed technology the excess of the purchase consideration over the net of the acquisitiondate fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill the amounts allocated to acquired technology and other intangible assets represent our estimates of their fair values at the acquisition date we amortize the acquired technology and other intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives the estimation of acquisitiondate fair values of intangible assets and their useful lives requires us to make assumptions and judgments including but not limited to an evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as they relate to our business industry and market trends projections of future cash flows and appropriate discount rates 

we test goodwill for impairment annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment as required under accounting standard update no 201108 testing goodwill for impairment” “asu 201108” asu 201108 provides for an optional assessment of qualitative factors of impairment “optional assessment” prior to necessitating a twostep quantitative impairment test should the optional assessment be utilized for any given fiscal year qualitative factors to consider include cost factors financial performance legal regulatory contractual political business or other factors entity specific factors industry and market considerations macroeconomic conditions and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value then performing the twostep impairment test is unnecessary 

under the twostep quantitative impairment test we use discounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether goodwill is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge impairment charges if any result from instances where the fair values of net assets associated with goodwill are less than their carrying values as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

for our annual impairment assessment in fiscal 2014  we did not utilize the optional assessment rather we used the quantitative twostep impairment test for each of our platform solutions and emerging business “pseb” manufacturing mfg architecture engineering and construction aec and media and entertainment “me” reporting units and used a discounted cash flow model which included assumptions regarding projected cash flows based on this testing we determined that the fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying value for each of the four reporting units and that there was no impairment of goodwill during the year ended january 31 2014  

realizability of longlived assets we assess the realizability of our longlived assets and related intangible assets other than goodwill annually during the fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review significant underperformance of a business or product line relative to budget shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends and the results of past impairment reviews when such events or changes in circumstances occur we assess recoverability of these assets 

2014 form 10k 37 

table of contents 

we assess   recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows we would perform a discounted cash flow analysis to assess impairments on longlived assets variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge impairment charges if any result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values 

in addition to our recoverability assessments we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our longlived assets any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made as well as in subsequent quarters 

we will continue to evaluate the values of our longlived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

income taxes we currently have  1879 million  of net deferred tax assets primarily a result of tax credits net operating losses and timing differences for reserves accrued liabilities stock options deferred revenue purchased technologies and capitalized intangibles partially offset by the establishment of us deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries deferred tax liabilities associated with tax method changes on advanced payments and valuation allowances against us and canadian deferred tax assets we perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets and believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors including intercompany transfer pricing adjustments any change in future profitability may require material adjustments to these net deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determination is made we believe our tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 

stockbased compensation  we measure stockbased compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award and recognize expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period we estimate the fair value of certain stockbased payment awards including grants of stock options and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan using either the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model or a binomiallattice model eg monte carlo simulation model to determine the grantdate fair value of our stockbased payment awards we use a blackscholes model or the quoted stock price on the date of grant unless the awards are subject to market conditions in which case we use the monte carlo simulation model the monte carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables to estimate the probability that market conditions will be achieved these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors the riskfree interest rate for the expected term of the award and expected dividends the variables used in these models are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted as needed sharebased compensation cost for restricted stock is measured on the closing fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

legal contingencies  as described in part i  item 3  “ legal proceedings ” and part ii  item 8  note 8  “ commitments and contingencies ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations

overview of fiscal 2014   



during fiscal 2014  as compared to the prior fiscal year net revenue decreased   2  gross profit decreased   4  and income from operations decreased   7  contributing to the year over year impact to revenue during fiscal 2014  were decreases in license and other revenue partially offset by increases in subscription revenue 

during the latter part of fiscal year 2014 we announced a business model transition as we began offering more flexible license and service offerings that have ratable revenue streams as a result our net revenue for fiscal 2014  excluded approximately 30 million that was deferred as a result of the our transition the 30 million related to flexible license arrangements with certain enterprise customers and had a particular impact on license revenue in the americas geography and the architecture engineering and construction aec business segment 

negatively impacting revenue especially within the asia pacific apac geography were changes in foreign currency rates for fiscal 2014  as compared to the prior fiscal year in addition our strategic decision related to our educational program to begin granting software licenses to educational institutions in select regions and to key partners negatively impacted revenue especially within the americas geography between fiscal 2014  and the prior fiscal year 

the reasons for these changes are discussed below under the heading “results from operations” 

revenue analysis 

revenue from flagship products was 51  of total net revenue during fiscal 2014  a decrease of 11  as compared to the prior fiscal year revenue from suites was 34  of total net revenue for fiscal 2014  an increase of 15  as compared to the prior fiscal year revenue from new and adjacent products was 14  of total net revenue during the fiscal 2014  a decrease of 2  as compared to fiscal 2013  we anticipate that as our new and existing customers migrate from our standalone products to suites our revenue from suites will increase as a percentage of revenue and that our revenue from our flagship and new and adjacent products will continue to decline as a percentage of revenue 

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including tech data corporation and its global affiliates collectively “tech data” tech data accounted for 24  and 23  of our consolidated net revenue during fiscal year 2014  and 2013  respectively we believe our business is not substantially dependent on tech data our customers through tech data are the resellers and end users who purchase our software licenses and services should any of the agreements between tech data and us be terminated for any reason we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue 

operating margin analysis 

income from operations decreased   7  in fiscal 2014  due to a  383 million  or 2  decrease in net revenue and a 358 million  or 15  increase in cost of revenue partially offset by a  530 million  or 3  decline in our operating expenses in each case as compared to the prior fiscal year our operating margin remained flat at 13  for fiscal 2014  and 2013  the increase in cost of revenue was driven by an increase in cloud servicesrelated expenses impacting the decline in operating expenses between fiscal 2014  and 2013  was the worldwide restructuring plan fiscal 2013 plan approved by autodesk during the third quarter of fiscal 2013  and the onetime stockbased compensation expense associated with the acquisition of socialcam during the third quarter of fiscal 2013  partially offsetting the decline in operating expense were restructuring charges from the worldwide restructuring plan fiscal 2014 plan approved by autodesk during the third quarter of fiscal 2014

table of contents 

further discussion regarding the cost of goods sold and operating expense activities are discussed below under the heading “results of operations” 

foreign currency analysis 

we generate a significant amount of our revenue in the us japan germany the united kingdom and france our revenue was negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate changes during fiscal 2014  as compared to the prior fiscal year had applicable exchange rates from fiscal 2013  been in effect during fiscal 2014  and had we excluded foreign exchange hedge gains and losses from fiscal 2014  “on a constant currency basis” net revenue would have increased   1  compared to the prior fiscal year 

our total spend defined as cost of revenue plus operating expenses during fiscal 2014   decreased   1  on an as reported basis as compared to the prior fiscal year had applicable exchange rates from fiscal 2013  been in effect during fiscal 2014  and had we excluded foreign exchange hedge gains and losses from fiscal 2014  total spend would have been minimally impacted by foreign exchange rate changes and would have remained flat on a constant currency basis compared to the prior fiscal year 

changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue total spend and income from operations in future periods we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on a portion of the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions but do not attempt to completely mitigate the impact of fluctuations of such foreign currency against the us dollar 

balance sheet and cash flow items 

at january 31 2014  we had  25444 million  in cash and marketable securities we completed fiscal 2014  with a higher deferred revenue balance and a lower accounts receivable balance as compared to the prior fiscal year our deferred revenue balance at january 31 2014  included  7893 million  of deferred subscription revenue primarily related to customer maintenance contracts which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the life of the contracts the term of our maintenance contracts is typically between one and three years our cash flow from operations increased   1  to 5635 million  as of january 31 2014  from 5591 million  at january 31 2013  we repurchased 105 million  shares of our common stock for  4238 million  during fiscal 2014  comparatively we repurchased 125 million  shares of our common stock for  4312 million  during fiscal 2013  further discussion regarding the balance sheet and cash flow activities are discussed below under the heading “liquidity and capital resources” 

business outlook 

autodesks business model is evolving we continue to assess current business offerings including introducing more flexible license and service offerings that have ratable revenue streams the accounting impact of these offerings and other business decisions are expected to result in an increase in the percentage of our ratable revenue making for a more predictable business over time while correspondingly reducing our upfront perpetual revenue stream over time we expect our business model transition to expand our customer base by eliminating higher upfront licensing costs and providing more flexibility with how customers use our products however we expect the business model transition to cause our traditional upfront perpetual license revenue to decline without a corresponding decrease in expenses in the future we expect this business model transition will increase our longterm revenue growth rate by increasing the annual value per subscription and increasing our subscription base over time 

we expect net revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2015  will range from 560 million to 575 million and that gaap diluted earnings per share will range from 001 to 004 while nongaap diluted earnings per share will range from 019 to 022 nongaap earnings per diluted share exclude 011 related to stockbased compensation expense 006 related to the amortization of acquisition related intangibles and 001 related to restructuring charges 

we expect net billings for fiscal 2015  to increase by approximately 5 to 8 compared to fiscal 2014we expect net revenue for fiscal 2015  to increase by approximately 3 to 5 compared to fiscal 2014 autodesk anticipates fiscal 2015 gaap operating margin to be approximately 5 to 8 and nongaap operating margin to be approximately 14 to 16 the 14 nongaap operating margin excludes 6 percentage points related to stockbased compensation expense and 3 percentage points related to the amortization of acquisition related intangibles the 16 nongaap operating margin excludes 5 percentage points related to stockbased compensation expense and 3 percentage points related to the amortization of acquisition related intangibles autodesk expects to add approximately 150000200000 net new subscriptions

fiscal 2014  net revenue compared to fiscal 2013  net revenue 

license and other revenue 

license and other revenue consists of two components all forms of product license revenue and other revenue product license revenue includes software license revenue from the sale of new seat licenses and upgrades and product revenue for creative finishing other revenue includes revenue from consulting training autodesk developers network and creative finishing customer support and is recognized over time as the services are performed 

total license and other revenue decreased   8  during fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  this decrease was primarily due to a 7  decrease in product license revenue as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year the decline in product license revenue was primarily due to a decrease of 15 in revenue from our flagship products partially offset by an increase of 10 in our suites products 

during fiscal 2014  the 7  decrease in product license revenue was due to a 21   decrease  in the number of seats sold partially offset by a 14   increase  in the average net revenue per seat product license revenue as a percentage of license and other revenue was 84  for fiscal 2014  and 83  for fiscal 2013  

during fiscal 2014  total other revenue represented 16  of license and other revenue other revenue decreased  by 11  during fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  this decrease is primarily due to a 56 decrease in our education products as a

subscription revenue 

our subscription revenue consists of two components maintenance revenue for our software products and revenue for our cloud service offerings including autodesk 360 our maintenance program provides our commercial and educational customers of perpetual products with a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of our new releases and enhancements when and if released during the term of their contracts under our maintenance program customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades when and if available downloadable training courses and online support we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement which is generally between one and three years but can occasionally be as long as five years revenue for our cloud service offerings is recognized ratably over the contract term commencing with the date our service is made available to customers and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 

subscription revenue increased   7  during fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  primarily due to a 9   increase  in commercial maintenance revenue the 9   increase  in commercial maintenance revenue was due to a 4   increase  from commercial enrollment during the corresponding maintenance contract term and a 5   increase  from net revenue per maintenance seat commercial maintenance revenue represented 95  and 94  of subscription revenue for fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  respectively 

changes in subscription revenue lag changes in net billings for subscription contracts because we recognize the revenue from those contracts ratably over their contract terms net subscription billings remained flat during fiscal 2014  as compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to a decline in multiyear maintenance subscriptions partially offset by an increase in billings from suites which have higher maintenance subscription prices 

our deferred subscription revenue balance at january 31 2014  and january 31 2013  was  7893 million  and  7531 million  respectively and primarily related to customer maintenance agreements which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement

cost of license and other revenue includes labor costs associated with product setup and fulfillment and costs of fulfilling consulting and training services contracts and collaborative project management services contracts cost of license and other revenue also includes stockbased compensation expense direct material and overhead charges amortization of purchased technology professional services fees and royalties direct material and overhead charges include the cost of hardware sold mainly pcbased workstations for creative finishing in the me segment costs associated with transferring our software to electronic media physical media packaging materials and shipping and handling costs 

cost of license and other revenue increased   8  during fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  primarily due to an increase in consulting support costs cost of license and other revenue remained flat during fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  primarily due to a decrease in creative finishing related expenses consistent with the decline in creative finishing revenue offset by an increase in stockbased compensation charges and amortization of acquisition related developed technologies 

cost of subscription revenue includes the labor costs of providing product support to our maintenance and cloud subscription customers including rent and occupancy shipping and handling costs professional services fees related to operating our network infrastructure including depreciation expense and operating lease payments associated with computer equipment data center costs salaries and related expenses of network operations cost of subscription revenue increased   32  during fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  primarily due to an increase in cloud servicesrelated expenses cost of subscription revenue increased   16  during fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  due to an increase in cloud servicesrelated expenses partially offset by decrease in costs as a result of the move to more electronic fulfillment 

cost of revenue at least over the near term is affected by the volume and mix of product sales mix of physical versus electronic fulfillment fluctuations in consulting costs amortization of purchased technology new customer support offerings royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products and employee stockbased compensation expense 

we expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars and slightly increase as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  primarily due to an increase in costs associated with meeting our major business initiatives

marketing and sales expenses include salaries bonuses benefits and stockbased compensation expense for our marketing and sales employees the expense of travel entertainment and training for such personnel the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue such as advertising trade shows and expositions and various sales and promotional programs marketing and sales expenses also include labor costs of sales and order processing sales and dealer commissions rent and occupancy and the cost of supplies and equipment 

marketing and sales expenses decreased   4  during fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  primarily due to lower advertising and promotional expenses and employeerelated costs from salaries bonus and commissions marketing and sales expenses increased   4  during fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  primarily due to higher employeerelated costs from salaries and fringe benefits and stockbased compensation primarily associated with increased headcount and merit increases in fiscal 2013 these costs were partially offset by a decrease in professional fees and advertising costs 

we expect to balance our need to invest in the marketing and sales of our products with our desire to actively manage our sales and marketing operating expenses as a result we expect marketing and sales expense to increase in absolute dollars and slightly increase as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  primarily due to an increase in costs as we work towards meeting our major business initiatives 

research and development 



research and development expenses which are expensed as incurred consist primarily of salaries bonuses benefits and stockbased compensation expense for research and development employees and the expense of travel entertainment and training for such personnel rent and occupancy and professional services such as fees paid to software development firms and independent contractors 

research and development expenses increased   2  during fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  primarily due to an increase in employeerelated costs from salaries and fringe benefits and an increase in professional fees partially offset by a decline in stockbased compensation expense due to a onetime charge associated with the acquisition of socialcam in fiscal 2013 research and development expenses increased   6  during fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  primarily due to an increase in stockbased compensation expense associated with the acquisition of socialcam in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and an increase in salaries and fringe benefits primarily due to merit increases in fiscal 2013

we expect general and administrative expense to slightly increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  primarily due to an increase in costs associated with supporting our major business initiatives 

restructuring charges benefits net 



during the third quarter of fiscal 2014  our board of directors approved a worldwide restructuring plan in order to rebalance staffing levels to better align them with the evolving needs of the business during fiscal 2014  autodesk recorded a restructuring charge of  128 million  of this amount  102 million  was recorded for onetime termination benefits and other costs and  26 million  was recorded for facilitiesrelated costs we expect to substantially pay the onetime termination benefits and facility related liabilities related to this plan by the end of our first quarter of fiscal 2015

interest and other expense income net 

the following table sets forth the components of interest and other income net 



 

 

interest and other expense income net decreased   90 million  during fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  primarily due to a reduction in our net interest and investment expense income 

the decrease in interest and investment expense income net during fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  is primarily due to interest expense resulting from the december 2012 issuance of  4000 million  aggregate principal amount of 195  senior notes due december 15 2017  and  3500 million  aggregate principal amount of 36  senior notes due december 15 2022  interest and investment income fluctuates based on average cash marketable securities and debt balances average maturities and interest rates 

interest and other income net decreased   32 million  during fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  primarily due to a reduction in our net interest and investment income and losses incurred due to impairments of certain strategic investments a loss on strategic investments occurs when a net reduction in valuation occurs or an impairment is recorded impairment results from the determination that the value of the investment is no longer recoverable 

provision for income taxes 

we account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse 

our effective tax rate was 18  and 20  during fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  respectively our effective tax rate decreased two percentage points from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014 due to an increase in tax benefits from foreign earnings taxed at different rates in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 offset in part by lower tax benefits from restructuring and additional tax expense associated with uncertain tax positions and audit assessements 

our effective tax rate was 20  and 21  during fiscal 2013  and 2012  respectively our effective tax rate decreased one percentage point from fiscal 2012  to fiscal 2013  primarily due to an increase in tax benefits from foreign earnings taxed at lower rates in fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012  partially offset by tax benefits associated with closure of audits in fiscal 2011 

our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate research credits state income taxes the tax impact of stockbased compensation accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations us manufacturers deduction closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits changes in valuation allowances and changes in tax laws including possible us tax law changes that if enacted could significantly impact how us multinational companies are taxed on foreign subsidiary earnings a significant amount of our earnings is generated by our europe and asia pacific subsidiaries our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates or we repatriate certain foreign earnings on which us taxes have not previously been provided

at january 31 2014  we had net deferred tax assets of  1879 million  we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize these assets 

for additional information regarding our income tax provision and reconciliation of our effective rate to the federal statutory rate of 35 see note 4  “ income taxes ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

other financial information 

in addition to our results determined under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” discussed above we believe the following nongaap measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the fiscal years ended january 31 2014  2013  and 2012  our gross profit gross margin income from operations operating margin net income and diluted earnings per share on a gaap and nongaap basis were as follows in millions except for gross margin operating margin and per share data 



  

 

 

for our internal budgeting and resource allocation process and as a means to evaluate periodtoperiod comparisons we use nongaap measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis these nongaap measures do not include certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results we use nongaap measures in making operating decisions because we believe those measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our earning potential and performance for management by excluding certain expenses and charges that may not be indicative of our core business operating results for the reasons set forth below we believe these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors both because 1 they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decisionmaking and 2 they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of our business this allows investors and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management compare financial results across accounting periods and to those of peer companies and to better understand the longterm performance of our core business we also use some of these measures for purposes of determining companywide incentive compensation 

there are limitations in using nongaap financial measures because nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies the nongaap financial measures included above are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results in addition they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the nongaap financial measures we compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a gaap basis as well as a nongaap basis and also by providing gaap measures in our

public disclosures the presentation of nongaap financial information is meant to be considered in addition to not as a substitute for or in isolation from the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap we urge investors to review the reconciliation of our nongaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures included below and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business

our nongaap financial measures may exclude the following 

stockbased compensation expense s we exclude stockbased compensation expenses from nongaap measures primarily because they are noncash expenses and management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods moreover because of varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under fasb asc topic 718 we believe excluding stockbased compensation expenses allows investors to make meaningful comparisons between our recurring core business operating results and those of other companies 

amortization of purchased intangibles we incur amortization of acquisitionrelated purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies amortization of intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions management finds it useful to exclude these variable charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods investors should note that the use of intangible assets contributed to our revenues earned during the periods presented and will contribute to our future period revenues as well amortization of purchased intangible assets will recur in future periods 

goodwill impairment this is a noncash charge to writedown goodwill to fair value when there was an indication that the asset was impaired as explained above management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

restructuring charges benefits net these expenses are associated with realigning our business strategies based on current economic conditions in connection with these restructuring actions we recognize costs related to termination benefits for former employees whose positions were eliminated and the closure of facilities and cancellation of certain contracts we exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing business and operating results we believe it is useful for investors to understand the effects of these items on our total operating expenses 

loss gain on strategic investments   we exclude gains and losses related to our strategic investments from our nongaap measures primarily because management finds it useful to exclude these variable gains and losses on these investments in assessing our financial results included in these amounts are noncash unrealized gains and losses on the derivative components and realized gains and losses on the sale or losses on the impairment of these investments we believe excluding these items is useful to investors because these excluded items do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business and these losses or gains were incurred in connection with strategic investments which do not occur regularly 

establishment of a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets this is a noncash charge to record a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets as explained above management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various cash expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

discrete tax items   we exclude the gaap tax provision including discrete items from the nongaap measure of income and include a nongaap tax provision based upon the projected annual nongaap effective tax rate discrete tax items include income tax expenses or benefits that do not relate to ordinary income from continuing operations in the current fiscal year unusual or infrequently occurring items or the tax impact of certain stockbased compensation examples of discrete tax items include but are not limited to certain changes in judgment and changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years certain costs related to business combinations certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets or changes in tax law management believes this approach assists investors in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations we believe the exclusion of these discrete tax items provides investors with useful supplemental information about the companys operational performance 

income tax effects on the difference between gaap and nongaap costs and expenses   the income tax effects that are excluded from the nongaap measures relate to the tax impact on the difference between gaap and nongaap expenses primarily due to stockbased compensation amortization of purchased intangibles and restructuring charges benefits for gaap and nongaap measures 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of cash is from the sale of licenses to our products our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employeerelated expenses such as compensation and benefits as well as general operating expenses for marketing facilities and overhead costs in addition to operating expenses we also use cash to fund our

stock repurchase program and invest in our growth initiatives which include acquisitions of products technology and businesses see further discussion of these items below 

at january 31 2014  our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  25444 million  and net accounts receivable of  4237 million  

in fiscal 2013 we issued  4000 million  aggregate principal amount of 195  senior notes due december 15 2017  and  3500 million  aggregate principal amount of 36  senior notes due december 15 2022  collectively the senior notes as of march 10 2014  we have  7500 million  aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding in addition we have a line of credit facility that permits unsecured shortterm borrowings of up to  4000 million  as of march 10 2014  we have no amounts outstanding under the credit facility we amended and restated the credit facility in may 2013 the amended and restated credit facility expires in may 2018 borrowings under the credit facility and the net proceeds from the offering of the senior notes are available for general corporate purposes 

our cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally our primary commercial banking relationship is with citigroup and its global affiliates in addition citibank na an affiliate of citigroup is one of the lead lenders and agent in the syndicate of our  4000 million  line of credit 

the increase in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities to  25444 million  at january 31 2014  from  23654 million  at january 31 2013  is due to cash generated by operating activities and proceeds from the issuance of common stock following stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases these increases to cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are partially offset by cash used for repurchases of common stock acquisitions including business combination and technology purchases capital expenditures and other investing activities the cash proceeds from issuance of common stock varies based on our stock price stock option exercise activity and the volume of employee purchases under the employee stock purchase plan “esp plan” 

the primary source for net cash provided by operating activities of  5635 million  for fiscal 2014  was net income of  2288 million  increased by the effect of noncash expenses totaling  2611 million  associated with depreciation amortization accretion and stockbased compensation in addition net cash flow provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities was  860 million  the primary source of working capital was a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in deferred revenue for fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  our days sales outstanding in trade receivables was 66  at january 31 2014  compared to 74  at january 31 2013  the days sales outstanding decrease relates primarily to improved billings linearity and strong cash collections resulting in a lower accounts receivable balance compared to the prior year the primary working capital uses of cash were an increase in deferred income taxes 

at january 31 2014  our shortterm investment portfolio had an estimated fair value of  4141 million  and a cost basis of  4108 million  the portfolio fair value consisted of  2610 million  invested in commercial paper and corporate securities  427 million  invested in agency bonds  389 million  invested in mutual funds  371 million  invested in time deposits with remaining maturities at the date of purchase greater than 90 days and less than one year  117 million  invested in municipal securities  114 million  invested in other shortterm securities and  113 million  invested in us government agency securities 

at january 31 2014   389 million  of trading securities were invested in a defined set of mutual funds as directed by the participants in our deferred compensation plan see note 6  “ deferred compensation ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

longterm cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following common stock repurchases the acquisition of businesses software products or technologies complementary to our business and capital expenditures including the purchase and implementation of internaluse software applications 

our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products technology and businesses acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers however they entail cost and integration challenges and in certain instances negatively impact our operating margins we continually review these tradeoffs in making decisions regarding acquisitions we currently anticipate that we will continue to acquire products technology and businesses as compelling opportunities become available our decision to acquire businesses or technology is dependent on our business needs the availability of suitable sellers and technology and our own financial condition

on november 7 2013 we entered into a definitive agreement with the shareholders of delcam plc “delcam” to acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital for £ 2075  per share or approximately £ 1746 million  or  2846 million  the transaction closed on february 6 2014 other than the delcam acquisition as of ja nuary 31 2014 there have been no material changes in our contractual obligations or commercial commitments compared to those disclosed in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition 

our cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances are concentrated in a few locations around the world with substantial amounts held outside of the us as of january 31 2014  approximately 75  of our total cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are located offshore and will fluctuate subject to business needs certain amounts held outside the us could be repatriated to the us subject to local law restrictions but under current us tax law could be subject to us income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits we have provided for the us income tax liability on foreign earnings except for foreign earnings that are considered permanently reinvested outside the us our intent is that amounts related to foreign earnings permanently reinvested outside the us will remain outside the us and we will meet our us liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings or both we regularly review our capital structure and consider a variety of potential financing alternatives and planning strategies to ensure we have the proper liquidity available in the locations in which it is needed and to fund our existing stock buyback program with cash that has not been permanently reinvested outside the us 

cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the risks detailed in part i item 1a  titled “ risk factors ” however based on our current business plan and revenue prospects we believe that our existing balances our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months 

our revenue earnings cash flows receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates for which we have put in place foreign currency contracts as part of our risk management strategy see part ii item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” for further discussion

purchase obligations are contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services and are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on autodesk and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligations relate primarily to it infrastructure costs hosting services agreements and marketing costs 

deferred compensation obligations relate to amounts held in a rabbi trust under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan see note 6  “ deferred compensation ” in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this plan 

pension obligations relate to our obligations for pension plans outside of the us see note 14  “ retirement benefit plans ” in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these obligations 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months in addition we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees including limited product warranties historically costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant but because potential future costs are highly variable we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations 

issuer purchases of equity securities 

autodesks stock repurchase program is largely to help offset the dilution from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and for such other purposes as may be in the interests of autodesk and its stockholders and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders the number of shares acquired and the timing of the purchases are based on several factors including general market conditions the volume of employee stock option exercises stock issuance the trading price of our common stock cash on hand and available in the us and company defined trading windows during the three and twelve months ended january 31 2014  we repurchased 22 million  and 105 million  shares of our common stock respectively at january 31 2014  218 million  shares remained available for repurchase under our current repurchase program approved by the board of directors this program does not have a fixed expiration date see note 9  “ stockholders equity ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of january 31 2014  we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements other than operating leases as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our revenue earnings cash flows receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency volatility that exists as part of our ongoing business operations we utilize cash flow hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions in addition we use balance sheet hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables and payables as of january 31 2014  and 2013  we had open cash flow and balance sheet hedge contracts with future settlements within one to twelve months contracts were primarily denominated in euros japanese yen swiss francs british pounds canadian dollars and australian dollars we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or

table of contents 

speculative purposes the notional amount of our option and forward contracts was  5572 million  and  4382 million  at january 31 2014  and 2013  respectively 

we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue and operating expenses of certain anticipated transactions a sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january 31 2014  indicated that a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 31 2014  and 2013  would increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by  79 million  and  296 million  respectively a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the dollar from its value at january 31 2014  and 2013  would increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by  37 million  and  331 million  respectively 

interest rate risk 

interest rate movements affect both the interest income we earn on our short term investments and the market value of certain longer term securities at january 31 2014  we had  15174 million  of cash equivalents and marketable securities including  4141 million  classified as shortterm marketable securities and  2773 million  classified as longterm marketable securities if interest rates were to move up or down by 50 and 100 basis points over a twelve month period the market value change of our marketable securities would have an unrealized gain or loss of  32 million  and  64 million  respectively 

other market risk 

from time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies the privately held companies in which we invest are considered inherently risky the technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

our management evaluated with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended i is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and ii is accumulated and communicated to autodesk’s management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as such term is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended during the quarter ended january 31 2014  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2014  in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in the 1992 internal control—integrated framework  our management has concluded that as of january 31 2014  our internal control over financial reporting is effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in item 8 herein 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within autodesk have been detected

product development and introduction 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware operating systems and software in addition our customers’ requirements and preferences rapidly evolve as do their expectations of the performance of our software to keep pace with these changes we maintain a vigorous program of new product development to address demands in the marketplace for our products just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry thirty years ago we believe our industry is undergoing a similar transition from the personal computer to cloud social and mobile computing 

we dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to further enhance our existing products and to create new products and technologies research and development expenditures were  6000 million  or 26  of fiscal 2013  net revenue  5665 million  or 26  of fiscal 2012  net revenue and  4962 million  or 25  of fiscal 2011  net revenue our software is primarily developed internally however we also use independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities additionally we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing or licensing products and technology from third parties we continually review these investments in an effort to ensure that we are generating sufficient revenue or gaining a competitive advantage to justify their costs 

the majority of our research and product development is performed in the united states china singapore and canada however we employ experienced software developers in many of our other locations translation and localization of our products are performed in a number of local markets principally singapore and switzerland we generally localize and translate our products into german french italian spanish russian japanese korean and simplified and traditional chinese 

we plan to continue to manage significant product development operations internationally over the next several years we believe that our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize product development lower costs and integrate local market knowledge into our development activities we continually assess the significant costs and challenges including intellectual property protection against the benefits of our international development activities 

in addition our business and our customers benefit from our relationships with a network of over 3900  thirdparty developers who develop and sell their own products that further enhance the range of integrated solutions available to our customers 

for further discussion regarding risks from our product development and introduction efforts see item 1a  “ risk factors ” 

marketing and sales 

we license or sell our products and services globally primarily through indirect channels consisting of distributors and resellers to a lesser extent we also transact directly with customers who are primarily large corporations our indirect channel model includes both a twotiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a onetiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers we have a network of approximately 2400  resellers and distributors worldwide for fiscal 2013  approximately 83  of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the future we employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our reseller channel with our business strategies sales through our largest distributor tech data corporation and its affiliates accounted for 23  17  and 16  of our net revenue for fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively on october 27 2011 tech data purchased certain assets of mensch and maschine software “mum” which has been a distributor of our products in europe the acquisition concentrates additional sales through tech data which on a consolidated basis would have accounted for 21  and 22  of our net revenue for fiscal years 2012  and 2011  respectively if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of fiscal 2011 we believe our business is not substantially dependent on tech data including following the acquisition of certain assets of mum our customers through tech data are the resellers and end users who purchase our software licenses and services should any of the agreements between us and tech data be terminated for any reason we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue no other distributor or reseller accounted for 10 or more of our revenue 

our customerrelated operations are divided into three geographic regions the americas europe middle east and africa “emea” and asia pacific “apac” each geographic region is supported by global marketing and sales organizations these organizations develop and manage overall marketing and sales programs and work closely with a network of domestic and international sales offices fiscal 2013  net revenue in the emea americas and apac was  8685 million   38   8362 



table of contents 

million   36  and  6075 million   26  respectively we intend to continue to make our products available in foreign languages we believe that international sales will continue to comprise the majority of our total net revenue adverse economic conditions in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue including emerging economies may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance a summary of our financial information by geographic location is found in note 13  “ segments ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements our international operations and sales subject us to a variety of risks see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion 

we also work directly with reseller and distributor sales organizations computer manufacturers other software developers and peripherals manufacturers in cooperative advertising promotions and tradeshow presentations we employ massmarketing techniques such as webcasts seminars telemarketing direct mailings advertising in business and trade journals and social media we have a worldwide user group organization and we have created online user communities dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products 

in addition to sales of new software licenses we generate revenue through our maintenance program and upgrade pricing options these choices are available for a majority of our products and offer our customers two alternative means of migrating to the most recent version of our products 

under the maintenance program known by our user community as the autodesk subscription program customers who own a perpetual use license for the most recent version of the underlying product are able to purchase maintenance that provides them with unspecified upgrades whenandifavailable and are able to download elearning courses and receive online support over a one year or multiyear maintenance service period revenue from our maintenance program is reported separately on our consolidated statements of operations and is referred to throughout this document as maintenance revenue 

upgrade pricing offers customers who are not on our maintenance program an opportunity to purchase upgrades to the most current version of the same product for an incremental fee at current available prices but only to the extent that they are still on an autodesksupported version of our product an upgrade also includes a crossgrade where a customer pays an incremental fee at currently available prices toward the purchase of a different product which generally has a higher price the cost of an upgrade is less than the cost of purchasing a new license during fiscal 2013  customers could upgrade from software that is three versions prior to the latest version available or newer at a percentage of a full license the license of the previous version of the product is terminated revenue from upgrades are reported on our consolidated statements of operations in “license and other” 

in fiscal 2013 we began offering our cloud and mobile platform autodesk 360 customer adoption and usage of this platform grew throughout fiscal 2013 as customers across a range of industries began to take advantage of the scalable computing power and flexibility provided through these cloud and mobile services 

 we are excited about the growth potential of our cloud and mobile services we expect to introduce more rental and usagebased offerings during fiscal 2014 these offerings will be designed to give our customers even more flexibility in how they use our products and will provide us with new ways to capture new market opportunities however we expect adoption and consumption of our cloud and rental offerings to increase gradually over time as such we are not anticipating any significant changes to our core business model in fiscal 2014 

our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller networks the loss of or a significant reduction in business with any one of our major distributors or large resellers could harm our business see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion 

customer and reseller support 

we provide technical support and training to customers through a leveraged support model augmented by direct programs designed to address certain specific needs our customers rely primarily on the resellers and distributors from which they purchased licenses to our products for technical support however we do provide certain direct support for some of our customers we support our resellers and distributors through technical product training sales training classes the internet and telephone we also provide online support directly to our customers through our maintenance program there are also a number of user group forums in which customers are able to share information 

educational programs 

we offer free access to autodesk software for students and educators around the world we also offer education programs and specially priced software licensing options tailored for educational institutions students and faculty to train the next

generation of users in addition we offer classroom support including standardized curricula developed by educators instructor development and a rich assortment of online learning resources users are trained on our products at educational institutions reducing the cost of training for our customers 

developer programs 

one of our key strategies is to maintain an openarchitecture design of our software products to facilitate thirdparty development of complementary products and industryspecific software solutions this approach enables customers and third parties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses we offer several programs that provide marketing sales technical support and programming tools to developers who develop addon applications for our products over 3900  developers in the autodesk developer network create interoperable products that further enhance the range of integrated solutions available to our customers 

competition 

the markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to rapid change we strive to increase our competitive separation by investing in research and development allowing us to bring new products to market and create exciting new versions of existing products that offer compelling efficiencies for our customers we also compete through investments in marketing and sales to more effectively reach new customers and better serve existing customers 

our competitors include large global publicly traded companies small geographically focused firms startup firms and solutions produced inhouse by their users our primary global competitors in the pseb aec and mfg segments include adobe systems incorporated ansys inc aveva group plc bentley systems incorporated dassault systèmes sa and its subsidiary dassault systèmes solidworks corp environmental systems research institute inc esri intergraph corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of hexagon ab msc software corporation nemetschek ag parametric technology corporation siemens product lifecycle software inc and trimble navigation limited 

our me segment also competes with a wide range of different companies from large global publiclytraded companies to small private entities large organizations that produce products that compete in some or all of our markets include adobe systems incorporated apple inc avid technology inc sony corporation and thomson among others the media and entertainment market is highly fragmented with complex interdependencies between many of the larger businesses as a result some of our competitors also own subsidiaries that are our customers or our partners in developing or bringing to market some of our solutions in addition to traditional competitors in developed economies we encounter new competitors in emerging economies 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing power with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the industry is presently undergoing a platform shift from the personal computer to cloud and mobile computing this shift lowers barriers to entry and poses a disruptive challenge to established software companies the design software market is characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete both from existing competitors and by entry of competitors with innovative technologies competition is increasingly enhanced by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies and the possibility that competitors in one vertical segment may enter other vertical segments that we serve in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources than we do because of these and other factors competitive conditions in these industries are likely to continue to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which could harm our business see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion of risks regarding competition 

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our abilities to better serve customers by offering new products including cloud and mobile computing products whether by internal development or acquisition and to continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to ease of use reliability performance range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation price and training 

intellectual property and licenses 

we maintain an active program to legally protect our investment in technology through intellectual property rights we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions the nature and extent of legal protection associated with each such intellectual property right depends on among other things the type of intellectual property right and the given jurisdiction in 



table of contents 

which such right arises we believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business including each of our segments 

nonetheless our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws enforcement of intellectual property rights against alleged infringers can sometimes lead to costly litigation and counterclaims our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business 

from time to time we receive claims alleging infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights including patents disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to among other things costly litigation or product shipment delays which could harm our business 

we retain ownership of software we develop all software is licensed to users and primarily provided in object code pursuant to either shrinkwrap embedded or online licenses or signed license agreements these agreements contain restrictions on duplication disclosure and transfer 

we believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our intellectual property and the rapid ongoing technological changes in both the computer hardware and software industries we must rely principally upon software engineering and marketing skills to maintain and enhance our competitive market position 

while we have recovered some revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the full extent to which piracy of our software products exists we believe however that software piracy is and can be expected to be a persistent problem that negatively impacts our revenue and financial results 

in addition through various licensing arrangements we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others we expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing arrangements in the future as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions to support continued development and sales of our products and services some of these licensing arrangements require or may require royalty payments and other licensing fees the amount of these payments and fees may depend on various factors including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments offsetting considerations if any and the degree of use of the licensed technology 

see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion of risks related to protecting our intellectual property 

production and suppliers 

the production of our pseb aec mfg and certain me software products involves duplication of the software media and for certain products the printing of user manuals the purchase of media and the transfer of the software programs onto media for distribution to customers are performed by us and by licensed subcontractors media for our products such as dvds and usb flash drives are available from multiple sources we offer our maintenance customers an electronic software download option for selected product updates customers who choose electronic fulfillment receive the latest version of the software from our vendor’s secure servers for certain products user manuals are made available by request only as we work toward reducing our cost of shipping and production as well as the use of natural resources user manuals and packaging materials are produced to our specifications by outside sources production is either performed in leased facilities operated by us or by independent thirdparty contractors to date we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the production of our software and documentation 

employees 

as of january 31 2013  we employed approximately 7300  people none of our employees in the united states are represented by a labor union however in certain foreign countries our employees are represented by work councils we have never experienced any work stoppages and believe our employee relations are good reliance upon employees in other countries entails various risks and changes in these foreign countries such as government instability or regulation unfavorable to foreignowned businesses that could negatively impact our business in the future

acquistions 

over the past three years we acquired new technology or supplemented our technology by purchasing businesses or certain technology related assets focused in specific markets or industries for the three years ended january 31 2013  2012  and 2011  we acquired a number of companies and certain technology related assets some of which were accounted for as business combinations the following were key acquisitions for fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  

  



backlog 

we typically ship products shortly after receipt of an order which is common in the software industry our backlog is comprised of current software license product orders which have not yet shipped the category of current software license product orders which we have not yet shipped consists of orders from customers with approved credit status for currently available software products and may include both orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period 

backlog was  200 million  at january 31 2013 compared to  271 million  at january 31 2012 the actual amount of backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects as this amount is impacted by a number of factors not related to future trends or events such as the order fulfillment process the method of software delivery or the linearity of our business within the fiscal period

risk factors 

tableend 

we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks a number of which are beyond our control in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following discussion highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on our business financial condition and future results of operations if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted causing the trading price of our common stock to decline in addition these risks and uncertainties may impact the “forwardlooking” statements described elsewhere in this form 10k and in the documents incorporated herein by reference they could affect our actual results of operations causing them to differ materially from those expressed in “forwardlooking” statements 

global economic conditions may further impact our business financial results and financial condition   

as our business has expanded globally we have increasingly become subject to risks arising from adverse changes in global economic and political conditions the past several years have been characterized by weak global economic conditions a tightening in the credit markets relatively high unemployment a low level of liquidity in many financial markets increased government deficit spending and debt levels uncertainty about certain governments abilities to repay such debt or to address certain fiscal issues such as the “fiscal cliff” and “sequestration” in the united states and volatility in many financial instrument markets there are a number of mixed indicators and it is not yet clear whether a sustainable recovery is occurring or a renewed slowdown is taking place 



table of contents 

over the past several years many of our customers have experienced tighter credit negative financial news and weaker financial performance of their businesses and have reduced their workforces thereby reducing the number of licenses and the number of maintenance contracts they purchase from us in addition a number of our customers rely directly and indirectly on government spending current debt balances of many countries without proportionate increases in revenues have caused many countries to reduce spending and in some cases have forced those countries to restructure their debt in an effort to avoid defaulting under those obligations this has not only impacted those countries but others that are holders of such debt and those assisting in such restructuring 

these actions may impact and over the past several years have negatively impacted our business financial results and financial condition in addition these factors are causing and over the past several years have caused us to restructure our business and in turn we have and will incur restructuring charges moreover our financial performance may be negatively impacted by 

 

 

 

 

 

even if economic conditions in the us and foreign markets improve generally a slower economic recovery in industries important to our business such as the architecture engineering and construction manufacturing and digital media and entertainment industries may adversely affect our business financial results and financial condition if a macroeconomic recovery does not occur as rapidly as anticipated our ability to meet our longterm financial targets may also be adversely affected 

the actions that we are taking to reorganize our business in alignment with our current operating strategy and in response to our related business slowdown may be costly and may not be as effective as anticipated 

during the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 we undertook a number of important organizational changes to drive the success of our business the reorganization included changes to the structure and alignment of our product development and marketing teams and reorganization of our sales teams while these changes were intended to better serve our customers and drive future growth we encountered challenges in the execution of these efforts which impacted our financial results in the short term in order to achieve these organizational changes and to further our strategy including our continuing shift to cloud and mobile computing in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013 we commenced a companywide restructuring plan if we are unable to realize the outcomes from the restructuring efforts as planned we may need to undertake additional restructuring efforts and our business and operating results may be harmed in taking any future restructuring actions we may incur additional costs that negatively impact our operating margins additionally a prolonged and slow economic recovery or a renewed recession in us or foreign markets could also lead to additional restructuring actions and associated costs 

we have taken actions to reduce our cost structure to more closely align our costs with our revenue levels in taking these actions we have attempted to balance the cost of such initiatives against their longer term benefits as a result of these actions we have incurred and will incur additional costs in the short term that have the effect of reducing our operating margins if we do not achieve the proper balance of these cost reduction initiatives we may eliminate critical elements of our operations the loss of which could negatively impact our ability to benefit from an economic recovery we cannot assure that our cost cutting efforts will achieve appropriate levels of expenses and we may take additional actions in the future 

in addition we are taking actions to stimulate demand for our products through a number of programs although we are attempting to balance the cost of these programs against their longer term benefits it is possible that we will make such

investments without a corresponding increase in demand for our products this would further reduce our operating margins and have a negative impact on our financial results 

existing and increased competition and rapidly evolving technological changes may reduce our revenue and profits 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing devices with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the industry is presently undergoing a platform shift from the personal computer to cloud and mobile computing this shift lowers barriers to entry and poses a disruptive challenge to established software companies the markets in which we compete are characterized by vigorous competition both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources furthermore a reduction in the number and availability of compatible thirdparty applications or our inability to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes including those related to cloud computing mobile devices and new computing platforms may adversely affect the sale of our products because of these and other factors competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which would likely harm our business 

we believe that our future results largely depend upon our ability to offer products that compete favorably with respect to reliability performance ease of use range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation and price 

our financial results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenue and financial results difficult to predict 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so in the future these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines in addition to the other factors described in this part i item 1a some of the factors that could cause our financial results to fluctuate include

we have also experienced fluctuations in financial results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic conditions in particular our financial results in europe during our third quarter are usually 



table of contents 

affected by a slower summer period and our asia pacific operations typically experience seasonal slowing in our third and fourth quarters 

  

our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenue and are relatively fixed in the short term accordingly any revenue shortfall below expectations have had and in the future could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability greater than anticipated expenses or a failure to maintain rigorous cost controls would also negatively affect profitability 

if we do not maintain good relationships with the members of our distribution channel or achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected if our distribution channel suffers financial losses becomes financially unstable or insolvent is negatively impacted by the 2011 consolidation between two important distributors or is not provided the right mix of incentives to sell our products our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected 

we sell our software products both directly to endusers and through a network of distributors and resellers for the fiscal year ended january 31 2013  approximately 83  of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the future our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller network computer software distributors and resellers typically are not highly capitalized have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and experienced difficulties during the past several years we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of distributors and resellers prior to our sales to them in the past we have taken steps to support them and may take additional steps in the future such as extending credit terms and providing temporary discounts these steps if taken could harm our financial results if our distributors and resellers were to become insolvent they would not be able to maintain their business and sales or provide customer support services which would negatively impact our business and revenue 

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including the distributor tech data corporation and its global affiliates “tech data” tech data accounted for 23  17  and 16  of our total net revenue for the fiscal years ended january 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

on october 27 2011 tech data purchased certain assets of mensch und maschine software “mum” in europe mum had been a european distributor of our products in that region the acquisition concentrates additional sales through tech data on a consolidated basis combined sales of the two entities would have accounted for 21   and 22  of our net revenue for fiscal 2012  and 2011  respectively if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of fiscal 2011 although we believe that we are not substantially dependent on tech data including following the acquisition of certain assets of mum if tech data were to experience a significant disruption with its business or if our relationship with tech data were to significantly deteriorate it is possible that our ability to sell to end users would be at least temporarily negatively impacted this could in turn negatively impact our financial results 

over time we have modified and will continue to modify aspects of our relationship with our distributors and resellers such as their incentive programs pricing to them and our distribution model to motivate and reward them for aligning their businesses with our strategy and business objectives changes in these relationships and underlying programs could negatively impact their business and harm our business in addition the loss of or a significant reduction in business with those distributors or resellers or the failure to achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough with any one of our major international distributors or large resellers could harm our business in particular if one or more of such distributors or resellers were unable to meet their obligations with respect to accounts payable to us we could be forced to write off such accounts and may be required to delay the recognition of revenue on future sales to these customers these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

a significant portion of our revenue is generated through maintenance revenue decreases in maintenance attach or renewal rates or a decrease in the number of new licenses we sell would negatively impact our future revenue and financial results 

our maintenance customers have no obligation to attach maintenance to their initial license or renew their maintenance contract after the expiration of their initial maintenance period which is typically one year our customers attach and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including the overall global economy the health of their businesses and the perceived value of the maintenance program if our customers do not attach maintenance to their initial license or renew their maintenance contract for our products our maintenance revenue will decline and our financial results will suffer 



table of contents 

in addition a portion of the growth of our maintenance revenue has typically been associated with growth of the number of licenses that we sell any reduction in the number of licenses that we sell even if our customers attach rates do not change will have a negative impact on our future maintenance revenue this in turn would impact our business and harm our financial results 

we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the term of the maintenance contracts which is predominantly one year but may also range up to five years decreases in net maintenance billings will negatively impact future maintenance revenue however future maintenance revenue will also be impacted by other factors such as the amount timing and mix of contract terms of future billings 

we are dependent on international revenue and operations exposing us to significant regulatory global economic intellectual property collections currency exchange rate taxation political instability and other risks which could adversely impact our financial results 

we are dependent on our international operations for a significant portion of our revenue international net revenue represented 71  and 72  of our net revenue in fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012  respectively our international revenue including that from emerging economies is subject to general economic and political conditions in foreign markets including conditions in foreign markets resulting from economic and political conditions in the us our revenue is also impacted by the relative geographical and country mix of our revenue over time these factors have recently adversely impacted and may in the future adversely impact our international revenue and consequently our business as a whole our dependency on international revenue makes us much more exposed to global economic and political trends which can negatively impact our financial results even if our results in the us are strong for a particular period further a significant portion of our earnings from our international operations may not be freely transferable to the us due to remittance restrictions adverse tax consequences or other factors our intent is that amounts related to foreign earnings permanently reinvested outside the us will remain outside the us and we will meet our us liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings such as our senior notes or both however if in the future amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are needed to fund our operations in the us or to service our external borrowings the repatriation of such amounts to the us could result in a significant incremental tax liability in the period in which the decision to repatriate occurs and payment of any such tax liability would reduce the cash available to fund our operations 

we anticipate that our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue and as we expand our international development sales and marketing expertise will provide significant support to our overall efforts in countries outside of the us risks inherent in our international operations include fluctuating currency exchange rates including risks related to any hedging activities we undertake unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and practices delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology tariffs quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions transportation delays operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices particularly in emerging economies increasing enforcement by the us under the foreign corrupt practices act adoption of stricter anticorruption laws in certain countries including the united kingdom difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales and development operations longer collection cycles for accounts receivable potential changes in tax laws including possible us tax law changes that if enacted could significantly impact how us multinational companies are taxed on foreign subsidiary earnings tax arrangements with foreign governments including our ability to meet and review the terms of those tax arrangements and laws regarding the management of and access to data and public networks possible future limitations upon foreign owned businesses increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities inadequate local infrastructure greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property and other factors beyond our control including popular uprisings terrorism war natural disasters and diseases 

some of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks 

  

our business could suffer as a result of risks costs and charges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments 

we regularly acquire or invest in businesses software products and technologies that are complementary to our business through acquisitions strategic alliances or equity or debt investments the risks associated with such acquisitions include among others the difficulty of assimilating products operations and personnel inheriting liabilities such as intellectual property infringement claims the failure to realize anticipated revenue and cost projections the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business in accordance with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the diversion of managements time and attention our recent increase in the number of 



table of contents 

acquisitions further exacerbates these risks 

in addition such acquisitions and investments involve other risks such as 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we may not be successful in overcoming such risks and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business in addition such acquisitions and investments have in the past and may in the future contribute to potential fluctuations in our quarterly financial results these fluctuations could arise from transactionrelated costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or writeoffs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments these costs or charges could negatively impact our financial results for a given period cause quarter to quarter variability in our financial results or negatively impact our financial results for several future periods 

net revenue or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline 

the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including the other factors described in this part i item 1a and the following 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

significant changes in the price of our common stock could expose us to additional costly and timeconsuming litigation 



table of contents 

historically after periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities a company becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts managements attention and resources 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the us and we make certain business and resource decisions based on assumptions about foreign currency we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 

we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our cash flow exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as part of our risk management strategy we use foreign currency contracts to manage a portion of our exposures of underlying assets liabilities and other obligations which exist as part of our ongoing business operations these foreign currency instruments have maturities that extend for one to twelve months in the future and provide us with some protection against currency exposures however our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be completely successful resulting in an adverse impact on our financial results 

the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period although our foreign currency cash flow hedge program extends beyond the current quarter in order to reduce our exposure to foreign currency volatility we do not attempt to completely mitigate this risk and in any case will incur transaction fees in adopting such hedging programs such volatility even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings 

our strategy to develop and introduce new products and services including our increased emphasis on cloud and mobile computing strategies exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance costs related to product defects and large expenditures that may not result in additional net revenue 

rapid technological changes as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences characterize the software industry just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry 30 years ago we believe our industry is undergoing a similar transition from the personal computer to cloud mobile and social computing in response we are focused on providing cloudbased services and delivery of our solutions on mobile devices and new hardware platforms to enable our customers to be more agile and collaborative on their projects we are also developing consumer products for digital art personal design and creativity and home design we devote significant resources to the development of new technologies such as our cloudbased and mobile services design and entertainment products digital prototyping and collaboration products and consumer products in addition we frequently introduce new business models or methods that require a considerable investment of technical and financial resources such as an increase in our portfolio of and focus on suites we are making such investments through our internal reorganization efforts and further development and enhancement of our existing products as well as through acquisitions of new product lines such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs market acceptance of these new technologies business models or methods will be dependent on our ability to 1 include functionality and usability in such releases that address certain customer requirements with which our operating history is not extensive and 2 to optimally price our products in light of marketplace conditions our costs and customer demand customer adoption of our cloud mobile and social computing services may not occur as rapidly as anticipated or competitors may introduce new products and services that achieve acceptance among our current customers adversely affecting our competitive position in addition our cloud mobile and social computing offerings price and deliver our products and services in a way that differs from our historical pricing and delivery methods 

in particular a critical component of our growth strategy is to have customers of our autocad and autocad lt products expand their portfolios to include our suites and cloudbased services over time we aim to migrate customers using standalone autodesk products to expand their portfolio with our suites and cloudbased offerings should sales of licenses of our autocad and autocad lt or standalone autodesk flagship products decrease without a corresponding increase in suites product or cloudbased services revenue or without purchases of customer seats to our suites our results of operations will be adversely affected also adoption of our cloud and mobile computing offerings and changes in the delivery of our software and services to our customers may change the way in which we recognize revenue relating to our software and services with a potential negative impact on our financial performance    additionally the software products we offer are complex and despite extensive testing and quality control may contain errors or defects these errors or defects could result in the need for corrective releases to our software products damage to our reputation loss of revenue an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products any of which would likely harm our business 



table of contents 

further given the rapid speed of changing customer expectations and advancement of technology inherent in the software industry the extensive and complex efforts required to create useful and widely accepted products and the rapid evolution of cloud computing mobile devices new computing platforms and other technologies such as consumer products our executive management team must act quickly continuously and with vision although we have articulated a strategy that we believe will fulfill these challenges if we fail to execute properly on that strategy adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve or fail to internalize and execute on that strategy we may fail to meet our customers expectations fail to compete with our competitors products and technology and lose the confidence of our channel partners and employees this in turn could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

from time to time we realign or introduce new business and sales initiatives if we fail to successfully execute and manage these initiatives our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

as part of our effort to accommodate our customers needs and demands and the rapid evolution of technology we from time to time evolve our business and sales initiatives such as realigning our development and marketing organizations and expanding our portfolio of suites and our offering of software as a service and realigning our internal resources in an effort to improve efficiency specifically last year we undertook organizational changes in order to address major business initiatives including our desire to accelerate our move to the cloud transform our customers experience increase industry focus to meet customer demands and develop more effective marketing these reorganizational efforts included changes to the structure and alignment of our product development and marketing teams and reorganization of our sales teams by industry we may take such actions without clear indications that they will prove successful and at times we have been met with shortterm challenges in the execution of such initiatives market acceptance of any new business or sales initiative is dependent on our ability to match our customers needs at the right time and price often we have limited prior experience and operating history in these new areas of emphasis if any of our assumptions about expenses revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated and our financial results will be negatively impacted 

because we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from a small number of products including our autocadbased software products including suites if these products are not successful our revenue will be adversely affected 

we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from sales of licenses of a limited number of our products including autocad software products based on autocad which includes our suites that serve specific markets upgrades to those products and products that are interoperable with autocad any factor adversely affecting sales of these products including the product release cycle market acceptance product competition performance and reliability reputation price competition economic and market conditions and the availability of thirdparty applications would likely harm our financial results during the fiscal year ended january 31 2013  combined revenue from our autocad and autocad lt products not including suites having autocad or autocad lt as a component represented 33  of our total net revenue 

  

a breach of security in our products or computer systems may compromise the integrity of our products harm our reputation create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results 

we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our product source code and computer systems the risk of a security breach or disruption particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyber terrorists has increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased these threats include identity theft unauthorized access dns attacks wireless network attacks viruses and worms advanced persistent threat apt application centric attacks peertopeer attacks phishing backdoor trojans and distributed denial of service ddos attacks any of the foregoing could attack our products and computer systems despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such programs it is virtually impossible for us to entirely eliminate this risk like all software products our software is vulnerable to such cyber attacks in the past hackers have targeted our software and they may do so in the future the impact of cyber attacks could disrupt the proper functioning of our software products cause errors in the output of our customers work allow unauthorized access to sensitive proprietary or confidential information of ours or our customers and other destructive outcomes m oreover as we continue to invest in new lines of consumer products and services we are exposed to increased security risks and the potential for unauthorized access to or improper use of the information of our consumer users if any of the foregoing were to occur our reputation may suffer customers may stop buying our products we could face lawsuits and potential liability and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

we rely on thirdparties to provide us with a number of operational services including hosting and delivery certain of our customer services and other operations any interruption or delay in service from these third parties breaches of security or 



table of contents 

privacy or failures in data collection could expose us to liability harm our reputation and adversely impact our financial performance 

we rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide our customers and computer operations for our internal use as we gather customer data and host certain customer data in thirdparty facilities a security breach could compromise the integrity or availability or result in the theft of customer data in addition our operations could be negatively affected in the event of a security breach and we could be subject to the loss or theft of confidential or proprietary information including source code 

unauthorized access to this data may be obtained through breakins breaches of our secure networks by unauthorized parties employee theft or misuse or other misconduct we rely on a number of third party suppliers in the operation of our business for the provision of various services and materials that we use in the operation of our business and production of our products although we seek to diversify our third party suppliers we may from time to time rely on a single or limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country for these services or materials the inability of such third parties to satisfy our requirements could disrupt our business operations or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy if any of these situations were to occur our reputation could be harmed we could be subject to third party liability including under data protection and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

  

if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights our business could be harmed 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright and trademark laws trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software products or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our software products is timeconsuming and costly while we have recovered some revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists and we expect that software piracy will remain a persistent problem furthermore our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 

additionally we actively protect the secrecy of our confidential information and trade secrets including our source code if unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code the loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for thirdparties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our financial performance and our reputation we also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of nondisclosure agreements with our customers contractors vendors and partners however it is possible that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization if this were to occur it may be difficult andor costly for us to enforce our rights and our financial performance and reputation could be negatively impacted 

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 

as more software patents are granted worldwide the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims infringement or misappropriation claims have in the past been and may in the future be asserted against us and any such assertions could harm our business additionally certain patent holders without products have become more aggressive in threatening and pursuing litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents any such claims or threats whether with or without merit have been and could in the future be timeconsuming to defend result in costly litigation and diversion of resources cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in addition such royalty or license agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms if at all which would likely harm our business 

our investment portfolio is composed of a variety of investment vehicles in a number of countries that are subject to interest rate trends market volatility and other economic factors if general economic conditions further decline this could cause the credit ratings of our investments to deteriorate illiquidity in the financial marketplace and we may continue to experience a decline in interest income and an inability to sell our investments leading to impairment in the value of our investments 

it is our policy to invest our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in highly liquid instruments with and in the custody of financial institutions with high credit ratings and to limit the amounts invested with any one institution type of security and issuer however we are subject to general economic conditions interest rate trends and volatility in the financial marketplace that can affect the income that we receive from our investments the net realizable value of our investments 



table of contents 

including our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and our ability to sell them in the us for example the yields on our portfolio securities are very low due to general economic conditions any one of these factors could reduce our investment income or result in material charges which in turn could impact our overall net income and earnings per share 

from time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies the privately held companies in which we invest are considered inherently risky the technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies 

if we were to experience a loss on any of our investments that loss may cause us to record an otherthantemporary impairment charge the effect of this charge could impact our overall net income and earnings per share in any of these scenarios our liquidity may be negatively impacted which in turn may prohibit us from making investments in our business taking advantage of opportunities and potentially meeting our financial obligations as they come due 

we are subject to legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries and we may be named in additional legal proceedings or become involved in regulatory inquiries in the future all of which are costly distracting to our core business and could result in an unfavorable outcome or a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or the trading price for our securities 

we are involved in legal proceedings and receive inquiries from regulatory agencies as the global economy has changed and our business has evolved we have seen an increase in litigation activity and regulatory inquiries like many other high technology companies the number and frequency of inquiries from us and foreign regulatory agencies we have received regarding our business and our business practices and the business practices of others in our industry have increased in recent years in the event that we are involved in significant disputes or are the subject of a formal action by a regulatory agency we could be exposed to costly and time consuming legal proceedings that could result in any number of outcomes although outcomes of such actions vary any claims or regulatory actions initiated by or against us whether successful or not could result in expensive costs of defense costly damage awards injunctive relief increased costs of business fines or orders to change certain business practices significant dedication of management time diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business in any of these cases our financial results could be negatively impacted 

although we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to section 404 we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting the report contains among other matters an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 

although we have determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 31 2013  as indicated in our management report on internal control over financial reporting included in this annual report on form 10k we must continue to monitor and assess our internal control over financial reporting if our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and such weakness remains uncorrected at fiscal yearend we will be unable to assert such internal control is effective at fiscal yearend if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective at fiscal yearend or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or concludes that we have a material weakness in our internal controls we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which would likely have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 

in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements which if not accurate may significantly impact our financial results 

we make assumptions judgments and estimates for a number of items including the fair value of financial instruments goodwill longlived assets and other intangible assets the realizability of deferred tax assets and the fair value of stock awards 



table of contents 

we also make assumptions judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee related liabilities including commissions bonuses and sabbaticals and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions partner incentive programs product returns reserves allowances for doubtful accounts asset retirement obligations and legal contingencies these assumptions judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from our estimates and such differences could significantly impact our financial results 

changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business further such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective 

for example the usbased financial accounting standards board “fasb” is currently working together with the international accounting standards board “iasb” on several projects to further align accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies who are required to follow us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” under sec regulations and those who are required to follow ifrs outside of the us these efforts by the fasb and iasb may result in different accounting principles under gaap that may result in materially different financial results for us in areas including but not limited to principles for recognizing revenue and lease accounting 

in addition the sec has not yet made a determination regarding how or if ifrs will be incorporated into the financial reporting system for us companies a change in accounting principles from gaap to ifrs may have a material impact on the way in which we report financial results 

it is not clear if or when these potential changes in accounting principles may become effective whether we have the proper systems and controls in place to accommodate such changes and the impact that any such changes may have on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows in addition as we evolve and change our business and sales models we are currently unable to determine how these potential changes may impact our new models particularly in the area of revenue recognition 

changes in laws andor regulations related to the internet or related to privacy and data security concerns or changes in the internet infrastructure itself may cause our business to suffer 

the future success of our business depends upon the continued use of the internet as a primary medium for commerce communication and business applications federal state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws or regulations affecting data privacy and the transmission of certain types of content using the internet for example the state of california has adopted legislation requiring operators of commercial websites and mobile applications that collect personal information from california residents to conspicuously post and comply with privacy policies that satisfy certain requirements several other us states have adopted legislation requiring companies to protect the security of personal information that they collect from consumers over the internet and more states may adopt similar legislation in the future additionally the federal trade commission has used its authority under section 5 of the federal trade commission act to bring actions against companies for failing to maintain adequate security for personal information collected from consumers over the internet and for failing to comply with privacyrelated representations made to internet users the us congress has at various times proposed federal legislation intended to protect the privacy of internet users and the security of personal information collected from internet users that would impose additional compliance burdens upon companies collecting personal information from internet users and the us congress may adopt such legislation in the future the european union also has adopted various directives regulating data privacy and security and the transmission of content using the internet involving residents of the european union including those directives known as the data protection directive the eprivacy directive and the privacy and electronic communications directive and may adopt similar directives in the future several other countries including canada and several latin american and asian countries have constitutional protections for or have adopted legislation protecting individuals personal information additionally some federal state or foreign governmental bodies have established laws which seek to censor the transmission of certain types of content over the internet or require that individuals be provided with the ability to permanently delete all electronic personal information such as the german multimedia law of 1997 



table of contents 

given the variety of global privacy and data protection regimes it is possible we may find ourselves subject to inconsistent obligations for instance the usa patriot act is considered by some to be in conflict with certain directives of the european union situations such as these require that we make prospective determinations regarding compliance with conflicting regulations increased enforcement of existing laws and regulations as well as any laws regulations or changes that may be adopted or implemented in the future could limit the growth of the use of public cloud applications or communications generally result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internetbased applications and require implementation of additional technological safeguards 

our financial results could be negatively impacted if our tax positions are successfully challenged by tax authorities 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions our effective tax rate is based on our expected geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany transfer pricing and enacted tax rules significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis we believe our tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 

our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our success and ability to invest and grow depend largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical professional managerial sales and marketing personnel historically competition for these key personnel has been intense the loss of services of any of our key personnel including key personnel joining our company through acquisitions the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions and financial goals 

we rely on third party technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies our product and service development may be delayed and our financial results negatively impacted 

we rely on certain software that we license from third parties including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions these thirdparty software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and the software may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software can be developed identified licensed and integrated which would likely harm our business 

disruptions with licensing relationships and third party developers could adversely impact our business 

we license certain key technologies from third parties licenses may be restricted in the term or the use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business similarly we may not be able to obtain or renew license agreements for key technology on favorable terms if at all and any failure to do so could harm our business 

our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with thirdparty developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn in particular markets such disruptions have in the past and would likely in the future negatively impact these thirdparty developers and end users which could harm our business 

additionally technology created by outsourced product development whether outsourced to third parties or developed externally and transferred to us through business or technology acquisitions have certain additional risks such as effective integration into existing products adequate transfer of technology knowhow and ownership and protection of transferred intellectual property 

as a result of our strategy of partnering with other companies for product development our product delivery schedules could be adversely affected if we experience difficulties with our product development partners 

we partner with certain independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities we believe our partnering strategy allows us to among other things achieve efficiencies in developing new products and 



table of contents 

maintaining and enhancing existing product offerings our partnering strategy creates a dependency on such independent developers independent developers including those who currently develop products for us in the us and throughout the world may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future in addition use of development resources through consulting relationships particularly in nonus jurisdictions with developing legal systems may be adversely impacted by and expose us to risks relating to evolving employment export and intellectual property laws these risks could among other things expose our intellectual property to misappropriation and result in disruptions to product delivery schedules 

  

we regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems disrupt our operations our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network and data center infrastructure internal technology systems and our websites for our development marketing operational support sales accounting and financial reporting activities we are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet the growing requirements of our business and customers such improvements are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or uncover problems with our existing technology systems unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in disruption in our business operations loss of revenue errors in our accounting and financial reporting or damage to our reputation 

our business may be significantly disrupted upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event 

our business is highly automated and relies extensively on the availability of our network and data center infrastructure our internal technology systems and our websites we also rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide to our customers and computer operations for our internal use the failure of our systems or hosted computer services due to a catastrophic event such as an earthquake fire flood tsunami weather event telecommunications failure power failure cyber attack or war could adversely impact our business financial results and financial condition we have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems in order to reduce the potential impact of a catastrophic event however there can be no assurance that these plans and systems would enable us to return to normal business operations in addition any such event could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products this could in turn decrease that countrys or regions demand for our products thereby negatively impacting our financial results 

we issued  7500 million  aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in a debt offering in december 2013 and have an existing  4000 million  revolving credit facility and may incur other debt in the future which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results 

in december 2012 we issued 195  notes due december 15 2017 in an aggregate principal amount of  4000 million  and 36  notes due december 15 2022 in an aggregate principal amount of  3500 million  as the december 2017 and december 2022 debt matures we will have to expend significant resources to either repay or refinance these notes if we decide to refinance the notes we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms or we may be unable to refinance the notes at all both of which may adversely affect our financial condition 

we also have a  4000 million revolving credit facility as of january 31 2013  we had no  outstanding borrowings on the line of credit although we have no current plans to borrow under this credit facility we may use the proceeds of any future borrowing for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business our existing and future levels of indebtedness may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by among other things 

 

 

 

we are required to comply with the covenants set forth in our senior unsecured notes and revolving credit facility our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control if we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the noteholders or lenders then subject to applicable cure periods any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact 



table of contents 

the value and liquidity of our securities under certain circumstances if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility could increase downgrades in our credit ratings could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing

strategy 

autodesk’s vision is to help people imagine design and create a better world we do this by developing software for the world’s designers architects engineers and digital artists—the people who create the worlds products buildings infrastructure films and games autodesk serves customers in three primary markets architecture engineering and construction manufacturing and digital media and entertainment 

our goal is to provide our customers with the world’s most innovative and engaging design software and services our product and services portfolio allows our customers to digitally visualize simulate and analyze their projects helping them to better understand the consequences of their design decisions save time money and resources and become more innovative 

today complex challenges such as globalization urbanization and sustainable design are driving our customers to new levels of performance and competitiveness and we are committed to helping them address those challenges and take advantage of new opportunities to achieve these goals we are capitalizing on two of our strongest competitive advantages our ability to bring advanced technology to mainstream markets and the breadth and depth of our product portfolio 

by innovating in existing technology categories we bring powerful new design capabilities to volume markets our products are designed to be easytolearn and use and to provide customers with a low cost of deployment a low total cost of ownership and a rapid return on investment in addition our software architecture allows for extensibility and integration with other products the breadth of our technology and product line gives us a unique competitive advantage because it allows our customers to address a wide variety of problems in ways that transcend industry and disciplinary boundaries this is particularly important in helping our customers address the complex challenges mentioned above we also believe that our technological leadership and global brand recognition have positioned us well for longterm growth and industry leadership 

in addition to the competitive advantages afforded by our technology our large global network of distributors resellers thirdparty developers customers educational institutions faculty and students is a key competitive advantage this network of relationships provides us with a broad and deep reach into volume markets around the world our distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with the resources to purchase deploy learn and support our products quickly and easily we have a significant number of registered thirdparty developers who create products that work well with autodesk products and extend them for a variety of specialized applications users with expertise in our products are broadly and globally available from educational institutions and in the existing workforce we offer extensive educational programs including student versions of software curricula and faculty development we have an extensive global community of students who are experienced with our software and poised to become the next generation of professional users – thus reducing the cost of training and providing fresh talent for our customers our global network of distributors resellers third party developers 



table of contents 

customers educational institutions and students has been developed over our thirty  year history we believe it is an enduring competitive advantage that is difficult for others to replicate 

we continually strive to increase the business value of our design tools to our customers in a number of ways first we seek to address an increasing portion of our customers workflow with products that extend the value of our customers digital design information into visualization analysis and simulation second we seek to improve our product interoperability and usability thus improving our customers productivity and effectiveness third we continue to develop new ways to deliver capability and value to our customers such as product suites cloud and socialbased services and delivery of our solutions on mobile devices and new hardware platforms fourth we extend our customers workflow with products for adjacent users and for the “customers of our customers” thus increasing the value of the design information our customers produce finally we continue to develop new lines of consumer products and services that are delivered and experienced through the web tablets and other mobile devices providing our advanced visualization technologies to consumers—a whole new category of autodesk customer 

autodesk was founded during the platform transition from mainframes and engineering workstations to personal computers we developed and sustained a compelling value proposition based upon desktop software for the personal computer just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry thirty years ago we believe our industry is undergoing a similar transition from the personal computer to cloud social and mobile computing to address this shift our major business initiatives include our desire to accelerate the business move to the cloud transform our customers experience increase industry focus to meet customer demands and develop more effective marketing 

during the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 we undertook a number of important organizational changes to drive the success of our business the reorganization included changes to the structure and alignment of our product development and marketing teams and reorganization of our sales teams while these changes were intended to better serve our customers and drive future growth we have encountered challenges in the execution of these efforts which have impacted our financial results in the short term in order to achieve these organizational changes and to further our strategy including our continuing shift to cloud and mobile computing in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013 we commenced a companywide restructuring plan the plan included a reduction of approximately 500  positions and the consolidation of eight  leased facilities with a total cost of up to  520 million  fiscal 2013 plan of which  439 million  was incurred during fiscal 2013 the termination benefits and facility related liabilities have been substantially paid as of fiscal year ended january 31 2013  autodesk expects to pay the remainder of the termination benefits and facility related liabilities through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 for further discussion see note 15  “ restructuring reserves ” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

our growth strategy is predicated upon leading the transition in the industries we serve into the cloud in three ways 

 

 

 

we believe that expanding our customers portfolios to include our suites presents a meaningful growth opportunity and is an important part of our overall strategy as our customers in all industries adopt our design suites we believe they will experience an increase in their productivity and the value of their design data for fiscal 2013  revenue from suites increased   16  as compared to the prior fiscal year as a percentage of revenue suites increased  to 30  in fiscal 2013  as compared to 27  in fiscal 2012  

expanding our geographic coverage is another key element of our growth strategy much of the growth in the world’s construction and manufacturing is happening in emerging economies further emerging economies face many of the 



table of contents 

challenges that our design technology can help address for example infrastructure buildout although revenue from emerging countries decreased   4  during fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  we believe that emerging economies continue to present longterm growth opportunities for us revenue from emerging countries represented 14  and 16  of fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012  net revenue respectively while we believe there are longterm growth opportunities in emerging economies conducting business in these countries presents significant challenges including economic volatility geopolitical risk local competition intellectual property protection poorly developed business infrastructure scarcity of talent and software piracy 

our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products technology and businesses acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers however they entail cost and integration challenges and may in certain instances negatively impact our operating margins we continually review these tradeoffs in making decisions regarding acquisitions we currently anticipate that we will acquire products technology and businesses as compelling opportunities become available 

our strategy depends upon a number of assumptions including that we will be able to continue making our technology available to mainstream markets leverage our large global network of distributors resellers thirdparty developers customers educational institutions and students improve the performance and functionality of our products and adequately protect our intellectual property if the outcome of any of these assumptions differs from our expectations we may not be able to implement our strategy which could potentially adversely affect our business for further discussion regarding these and related risks see part i  item 1a  “ risk factors ” 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we regularly reevaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we believe that of all our significant accounting policies the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 

for multiple element arrangements containing only software and softwarerelated elements we allocate the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on their vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value vsoe is the price charged when an element is sold separately or a price set by management with the relevant authority if we do not have vsoe of an undelivered software license we defer revenue recognition on the entire sales arrangement until all elements for which we do not have vsoe are delivered if we do not have vsoe for undelivered maintenance or services the revenue for the arrangement is recognized over the longest contractual service period in the arrangement we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 

for multiple elements arrangements involving nonsoftware elements including cloud subscription services our revenue recognition policy is based upon the accounting guidance contained in asc 605 revenue recognition  for these arrangements we first allocate the total arrangement consideration based on the relative selling prices of the software group of elements as a whole and to the nonsoftware elements we then further allocate consideration within the software group to the respective elements within that group using the residual method as described above we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of revenue to be recognized in each accounting period 

our assessment of likelihood of collection is also a critical factor in determining the timing of revenue recognition if we do not believe that collection is probable the revenue will be deferred until the earlier of when collection is deemed probable or payment is received 

our indirect channel model includes both a twotiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a 



table of contents 

onetiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers our product license revenue from distributors and resellers are generally recognized at the time title to our product passes to the distributor in a twotiered structure or reseller in a onetiered structure provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met this policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns among other criteria we are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers our policy also presumes that we have no significant performance obligations in connection with the sale of our product licenses by our distributors and resellers to their customers if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

marketable securities at january 31 2013  we had  7532 million  of short and longterm marketable securities marketable securities are stated at fair value as described in note 2  “ financial instruments ” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements we estimate the fair value of our marketable securities each quarter fair value is defined as an exit price representing the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when identical or similar assets are traded in active markets the level of judgment required to estimate their fair value is relatively low this is generally true for our cash and cash equivalents and the majority of our marketable securities which we consider to be level 1 assets and level 2 assets however determining the fair value of marketable securities when observable inputs are not available level 3 requires significant judgment for example we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our auction rate securities because we have determined that the market for those securities is inactive these assumptions are inherently subjective and involve significant management judgment whenever possible we use observable market data and rely on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available when determining fair value 

business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to assets and liabilities as well as to inprocess research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date the purchase price allocation process requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations 

although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain examples of critical estimates used in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from sales maintenance agreements and acquired developed technologies the acquired company’s trade name and customer relationships as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and customer relationships will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio expected costs to develop the inprocess research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed and discount rates 

goodwill we test goodwill for impairment annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment when assessing goodwill for impairment we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount qualitative factors considered in this assessment include cost factors financial performance legal regulatory contractual political business or other factors entity specific factors industry and market considerations macroeconomic conditions and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value then performing the twostep impairment test is unnecessary if the twostep impairment test is necessary we use discounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether goodwill is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge impairment charges if any result from instances where the fair values of net assets associated with goodwill are less than their carrying values as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

for our annual impairment assessment in fiscal 2013  based on a review of the qualitative factors described above we determined that for each of our platform solutions and emerging business manufacturing mfg and architecture engineering and construction aec reporting units it was more likely than not that the fair vale of the reporting units exceeded the carrying amount as a result we concluded that performing the twostep impairment test was not necessary for these reporting units 

for the media and entertainment “me” reporting unit autodesk deemed the twostep impairment test was necessary and used a discounted cash flow model which included assumptions regarding projected cash flows based on this testing 



table of contents 

autodesk determined that there was no impairment of goodwill for the me reporting unit during the year ended january 31 2013  

realizability of longlived assets we assess the realizability of our longlived assets and related intangible assets other than goodwill annually during the fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review significant underperformance of a business or product line relative to budget shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends and the results of past impairment reviews when such events or changes in circumstances occur we assess recoverability of these assets 

we assess   recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows we would perform a discounted cash flow analysis to assess impairments on longlived assets variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge impairment charges if any result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values 

in addition to our recoverability assessments we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our longlived assets any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made as well as in subsequent quarters 

we will continue to evaluate the values of our longlived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

income taxes we currently have  1650 million  of net deferred tax assets primarily a result of tax credits net operating losses and timing differences for reserves accrued liabilities stock options deferred revenue purchased technologies and capitalized intangibles partially offset by the establishment of us deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries deferred tax liabilities associated with tax method change on advanced payments and valuation allowances against us and canadian deferred tax assets we perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets and believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors including intercompany transfer pricing adjustments any change in future profitability may require material adjustments to these net deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determination is made we believe our tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 

stockbased compensation  we measure stockbased compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award and recognize expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period we estimate the fair value of certain stockbased payment awards including grants of stock options and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model the determination of the fair value of a stockbased award on the date of grant using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors the riskfree interest rate for the expected term of the award and expected dividends the variables used in the model are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted as needed sharebased compensation cost for restricted stock is measured on the closing fair market value of our commons stock on the date of grant the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

legal contingencies  as described in part i  item 3  “ legal proceedings ” and part ii  item 8  note 8  “ commitments and contingencies ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations

overview of fiscal 2013   



we experienced mixed results in fiscal 2013  during fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  net revenue increased   4  and gross profit increased   4  while income from operations decreased   14  contributing to the year over year increases in revenue during fiscal 2013  were increases in revenue from maintenance and new seat license revenue we experienced increases in revenue for many of our major products reportable segments and geographic areas during fiscal 2013  as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year the reasons for these increases are discussed below under the heading results from operations 

revenue from flagship products was 56  of total net revenue during fiscal 2013  an increase of 1  as compared to fiscal 2012  revenue from suites was 30  of total net revenue for fiscal 2013  an increase of 16  as compared to fiscal 2012  revenue from new and adjacent products was 15  of total net revenue during the fiscal 2013  a decreased  of 3  as compared to fiscal 2012  we anticipate that as our new and existing customers migrate from our standalone products our revenue from suites will increase as a percentage of revenue and that our revenue from our flagship and new and adjacent products will decline as a percentage of revenue 

while net revenue increased   966 million  or 4  for fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  our operating expenses increased   1369 million  or 8  for fiscal 2013  the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to higher employee related costs and restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2013  as a result of the fiscal 2013 plan similarly income from operations decreased 14  in fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  and our total operating margin decreased  from 16  for fiscal 2012  to 13  for fiscal 2013  primarily due to higher employee related costs and restructuring charges during fiscal 2013  

we believe net revenue for fiscal 2014  will increase by approximately 6 compared to fiscal 2013  we anticipate fiscal 2014  operating margin will increase by approximately 455 to 480 basis points compared to fiscal 2013  

we generate a significant amount of our revenue in the us japan germany canada and the united kingdom our revenue was negatively impacted from foreign exchange rate changes during fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  had applicable exchange rates from fiscal 2012  been in effect during fiscal 2013  and had we excluded foreign exchange hedge gains and losses from fiscal 2013  “on a constant currency basis” net revenue would have increased   5  compared to the prior fiscal year during fiscal 2013  total spend defined as cost of revenue plus operating expenses increased   8  both as reported and on a constant currency basis compared to the prior fiscal year changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue total spend and income from operations in future periods we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on a portion of the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions but do not attempt to completely mitigate the impact of fluctuation of such foreign currency against the us dollar 

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including tech data corporation and its global affiliates collectively “tech data” tech data accounted for 23  and 17  of our consolidated net revenue during fiscal year 2013  and 2012  respectively on october 27 2011 tech data purchased certain assets of mensch und maschine software “mum” which has been a distributor of our products in europe the acquisition concentrates additional sales through tech data which on a consolidated basis would have accounted for 21  of our net revenue for fiscal years 2012  if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of fiscal 2012we believe our business is not substantially 



table of contents 

dependent on tech data our customers through tech data are the resellers and end users who purchase our software licenses and services should any of the agreements between tech data and us be terminated for any reason we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue 

our primary goals for fiscal 2014  are to grow revenue from our current levels consistent with seasonal trends manage our operating margin and to invest in product functionality and new product lines including suites offerings while controlling our operating expenses in addition we will continue to look closely at our cost structure to find ways to improve our operating margin while allowing continued investment in growth and productivity initiatives there can be no assurance that we will achieve our financial goals and improve our financial results additionally we believe that unemployment rates and the availability of credit to major industries we serve are important indicators for our business if we are unable to successfully achieve our major business initiatives or if global economic conditions deteriorate we may not achieve our financial goals 

at january 31 2013  we had  23654 million  in cash and marketable securities this amount includes the aggregate net proceeds of 7393 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and related offering expenses from our december 2012 registered underwritten public offering of 4000 million aggregate principal amount of 195 senior notes due december 15 2017 and 3500 million aggregate principal amount of 36 senior notes due december 15 2022 

we completed fiscal 2013  with a higher deferred revenue balance and a higher accounts receivable balance as compared to fiscal 2012  our deferred revenue balance at january 31 2013  included  7335 million  of customer maintenance contracts which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the life of the contracts the term of our maintenance contracts is typically one year but may be two or three year or occasionally as long as five years we repurchased 125 million  shares of our common stock for  4312 million  during fiscal 2013  comparatively we repurchased 97 million  shares of our common stock for  3274 million  during fiscal 2012

total license and other revenue increased   2  during fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  this increase was primarily due to the 6  increase in revenue from commercial new seat licenses during fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  during fiscal 2013  all of the 6  increase was due to the increase in the number of seats sold average net revenue per seat was flat in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 commercial new seat revenue as a percentage of license and other revenue was 69  for fiscal 2013  and 67  for fiscal 2012  

offsetting the increase in commercial new seat license revenue during fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  was the 3  decrease in upgrade revenue upgrade revenue decreased during fiscal 2013  in comparison to fiscal 2012 primarily due to more successful upgrade promotions run during fiscal 2012 than in fiscal 2013 

backlog related to current software license product orders that had not shipped at the end of the quarter decreased  by  71 million  during fiscal 2013  from  271 million  at january 31 2012  to  200 million  at january 31 2013  backlog from current software license product orders that we have not yet shipped consists of orders for currently available licensed software products from customers with approved credit status and may include orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period

maintenance revenue increased   7  during fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  primarily due to a 7  increase in commercial maintenance revenue the 7  increase in commercial maintenance revenue was due to a 6  percentage point increase in commercial enrollment during the corresponding maintenance contract term and a 1 percentage point increase in average net revenue per maintenance seat commercial maintenance revenue represented 98  of maintenance revenue for both fiscal 2013  and 2012  

changes in maintenance revenue lag changes in net billings for maintenance contracts because we recognize the revenue from those contracts ratably over their contract terms the term of our maintenance contracts is predominantly one year but may be two or three years or occasionally as long as five years net maintenance billings increased 4  during fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  net maintenance billings increased due to early maintenance renewals in advance of a price increase and due to new multiyear maintenance contracts 

our deferred revenue balance at january 31 2013  and january 31 2012  was  8346 million  and  7192 million  respectively primarily related to customer maintenance contracts which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the life of the contracts

cost of revenue and operating expenses 

cost of revenue 



cost of license and other revenue includes labor costs of order fulfillment and costs of fulfilling consulting and training services contracts and collaborative project management services contracts cost of license and other revenue also includes stockbased compensation expense direct material and overhead charges amortization of purchased technology professional services fees and royalties direct material and overhead charges include the cost of hardware sold mainly pcbased workstations for creative finishing in the me segment costs associated with transferring our software to electronic media printing of user manuals and packaging materials and shipping and handling costs 

cost of license and other revenue increased   6  during fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  primarily due to an increase in cloud servicesrelated expenses cost of license and other revenue increased   15  during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  primarily due to increased support costs and lower margin consulting engagements 

cost of maintenance revenue includes labor costs of providing product support to our maintenance customers including stockbased compensation expense for these employees rent and occupancy shipping and handling costs and professional services fees cost of maintenance revenue decreased   4  during fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  primarily due to an increase in electronic fulfillment cost of maintenance revenue increased   22  during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  due to an increase in maintenance support headcount and increased annual fulfillment costs related to supplying usb flash drives of our suites products 



table of contents 

cost of revenue at least over the near term is affected by the volume and mix of product sales mix of physical versus electronic fulfillment fluctuations in consulting costs amortization of purchased technology new customer support offerings royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products and employee stockbased compensation expense 

we expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars and slightly increase as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  primarily due to an increase in costs associated with meeting our major business initiatives 

marketing and sales 



marketing and sales expenses include salaries bonuses benefits and stockbased compensation expense for our marketing and sales employees and the expense of travel entertainment and training for such personnel and the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue such as advertising trade shows and expositions and various sales and promotional programs marketing and sales expenses also include labor costs of sales and order processing sales and dealer commissions rent and occupancy and the cost of supplies and equipment 

marketing and sales expenses increased   4  during fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  primarily due to higher employeerelated costs from salaries and fringe benefits and stockbased compensation primarily associated with increased headcount and merit increases in fiscal 2013 these costs were partially offset by a decrease in professional fees and advertising costs marketing and sales expenses increased   9  during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  primarily due to higher employeerelated costs related to salaries and fringe benefits primarily associated with increased head count and the reinstatement of merit increases in fiscal 2012 

we expect to balance our need to invest in the marketing and sales of our products with our desire to actively manage our sales and marketing operating expenses as a result we expect marketing and sales expense to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  primarily due to an increase in costs as we work towards meeting our major business initiatives 

research and development 



research and development expenses which are expensed as incurred consist primarily of salaries bonuses benefits and stockbased compensation expense for research and development employees and the expense of travel entertainment and training for such personnel rent and occupancy and professional services such as fees paid to software development firms and independent contractors 

research and development expenses increased   6  during fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  primarily due to an increase in stockbased compensation expense associated with the acquisition of socialcam in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and an increase in salaries and fringe benefits primarily due to merit increases in fiscal 2013 research and development expenses increased   14  during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  primarily due to an increase in salaries and fringe benefits primarily associated with increased headcount and the reinstatement of merit increases in fiscal 2012 and an increase in professional service fees in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011

we expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  as we continue to invest in product development in fiscal 2014  

general and administrative 



general and administrative expenses include salaries bonuses benefits and stockbased compensation expense for our finance human resources and legal employees as well as professional fees for legal and accounting services expenses related to our operating expense hedge activity amortization of acquisition related customer relationships and trade names and expense of travel entertainment and training 

general and administrative expenses increased   11  from fiscal 2012  to fiscal 2013  primarily due to an increase in amortization of acquisition related customer relationships and trade names and fluctuations in our operating expense hedge activity in fiscal 2013  also contributing to the increase was an increase in salaries primarily due to merit increases in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 general and administrative expenses increased   11  from fiscal 2011  to fiscal 2012  primarily due to an increase in amortization of acquisition related customer relationships and trade names and the increase in salaries primarily associated with increased head count and the reinstatement of merit increases in fiscal 2012 

we expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  primarily due to an increase in costs associated with supporting our major business initiatives 

restructuring charges benefits net 



during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 autodesk initiated a restructuring plan that included a reduction in force and the consolidation of certain leased facilities during fiscal 2013  autodesk recorded a restructuring charge of  439 million  of this amount  406 million  was recorded for onetime termination benefits and other costs and  33 million  was recorded for facilitiesrelated costs these termination benefits and facility related liabilities have been substantially paid as of fiscal year ended january 31 2013  see note 15  “ restructuring reserves ” in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

interest and other income net 

the following table sets forth the components of interest and other income net 



 

 

interest and other income net decreased   32 million  during fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  primarily due to a reduction in our net interest and investment income and losses incurred due to impairment of certain strategic investments a loss on strategic investments occurs when a net reduction in valuation occurs or an impairment is recorded impairment results from the determination that the value of the investment is no longer recoverable 

the decrease in interest and investment income net during fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  is primarily due to interest expense resulting from the issuance of  4000 million  aggregate principal amount of 195  senior notes due december 15 2017  and  3500 million  aggregate principal amount of 36  senior notes due december 15 2022  and a decrease in the fair value of our trading securities that are markedtomarket each period interest and investment income fluctuates based on average cash marketable securities and debt balances average maturities and interest rates 

interest and other income net increased   67 million  during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  primarily due to a reduction in foreign currency losses these losses are due to the impact of remeasuring foreign currency transactions into the functional currency of the corresponding entity the amount of gain loss on foreign currency is driven by the volume of foreign currency transactions and the foreign currency exchange rates for the period 

provision for income taxes 

we account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse 

our effective tax rate was 20 and 21 during fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012  respectively our effective tax rate decreased one percentage point from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013 due to lower state tax expense and various other items offset in part by increased nondeductible stockbased compensation expense 

our effective tax rate was 21 and 22 during fiscal 2012  and 2011  respectively our effective tax rate decreased one percentage point from fiscal 2011  to fiscal 2012  primarily due to an increase in tax benefits from foreign earnings taxed at different rates in fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011  partially offset by tax benefits associated with closure of audits in fiscal 2011 

our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate research credits state income taxes the tax impact of stockbased compensation accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations us manufacturers deduction closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits changes in valuation allowances and changes in tax laws including possible us tax law changes that if enacted could significantly impact how us multinational companies are taxed on foreign subsidiary earnings a significant amount of our earnings is generated by our europe and asia pacific subsidiaries our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates or we repatriate certain foreign earnings on which us taxes have not previously been provided 



table of contents 

at january 31 2013  we had net deferred tax assets of  1650 million  we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize these assets 

for additional information regarding our income tax provision and reconciliation of our effective rate to the federal statutory rate of 35 see note 4  “ income taxes ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

other financial information 

in addition to our results determined under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” discussed above we believe the following nongaap measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the fiscal years ended january 31 2013  2012  and 2011  our gross profit gross margin income from operations operating margin net income and diluted earnings per share on a gaap and nongaap basis were as follows in millions except for gross margin operating margin and per share data 



  

 

 

for our internal budgeting and resource allocation process we use nongaap measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis these nongaap measures do not include certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results we use nongaap measures in making operating decisions because we believe those measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our earning potential in addition these nongaap financial measures facilitate comparisons to our historical results and operating guidance as well as that of competitors we also use these measures for purposes of determining companywide incentive compensation 

there are limitations in using nongaap financial measures because nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies the nongaap financial measures included above are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results in addition they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the nongaap financial measures we compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a gaap basis as well as a nongaap basis and also by providing gaap measures in our public disclosures the presentation of nongaap financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap the nongaap financial measures are meant to supplement and be viewed in conjunction with gaap financial measures we urge investors to review the reconciliation of our nongaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures included below and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business

reconciliation of gaap financial measures to nongaap financial measures 

in millions except for gross margin operating margin and per share data 



 

 



table of contents 

our nongaap financial measures as set forth in the table above exclude the following 

stockbased compensation expenses  we exclude stockbased compensation expenses from nongaap measures primarily because they are noncash expenses and management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

amortization of purchased intangibles  we incur amortization of acquisitionrelated purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies the amortization of purchased intangibles varies depending on the level of acquisition activity and management finds it useful to exclude these variable charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

goodwill impairment  this is a noncash charge to writedown goodwill to fair value when there was an indication that the asset was impaired as explained above management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

restructuring charges benefits net  these expenses are associated with realigning our business strategies based on current economic conditions in connection with these restructuring actions we recognize costs related to termination benefits for former employees whose positions were eliminated and the closure of facilities and cancellation of certain contracts we exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing financial results in the current period 

loss gain on strategic investments  we exclude gains and losses related to our strategic investments from our nongaap measures primarily because management finds it useful to exclude these variable gains and losses on these investments in assessing our financial results included in these amounts are noncash unrealized gains and losses on the derivative components and realized gains and losses on the sale or losses on the impairment of these investments 

establishment of a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets  this is a noncash charge to record a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets as explained above management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various cash expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

discrete tax items  we exclude the gaap tax provision including discrete items from the nongaap measure of income and include a nongaap tax provision based upon the projected annual nongaap effective tax rate discrete tax items include income tax expenses or benefits that do not relate to ordinary income from continuing operations in the current fiscal year unusual or infrequently occurring items or the tax impact of certain stockbased compensation examples of discrete tax items include but are not limited to certain changes in judgment and changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years certain costs related to business combinations certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets or changes in tax law management believes this approach assists investors in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations 

income tax effects on the difference between gaap and nongaap costs and expenses  the income tax effects that are excluded from the nongaap measures relate to the tax impact on the difference between gaap and nongaap costs and expenses primarily due to stockbased compensation purchased intangibles and restructuring for gaap and nongaap measures 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of cash is from the sale of licenses to our products our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employeerelated expenses such as compensation and benefits as well as general operating expenses for marketing facilities and overhead costs in addition to operating expenses we also use cash to invest in our growth initiatives which include acquisitions of products technology and businesses and to fund our stock repurchase program see further discussion of these items below 

at january 31 2013  our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  23654 million  and net accounts receivable of  4951 million  

in december 2012 we issued  4000 million  aggregate principal amount of 195  senior notes due december 15 2017  and  3500 million  aggregate principal amount of 36  senior notes due december 15 2022  collectively the senior notes in addition we have a line of credit facility that permits unsecured shortterm borrowings of up to  4000 million  this line of credit facility was entered into in may 2011 and expires in 2016  during fiscal 2013  we borrowed 1100 million under the credit facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we repaid the outstanding balance on our credit facility with a portion of the 



table of contents 

net proceeds from the sale of the senior notes issued in december 2012 borrowings under the credit facility and the remaining net proceeds from the offering of the senior notes are available for general corporate purposes 

our cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally our primary commercial banking relationship is with citibank and its global affiliates “citibank” in addition citibank is one of the lead lenders and agent in the syndicate of our  4000 million  line of credit 

the increase in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities to  23654 million  at january 31 2013  from  16041 million  at january 31 2012  is principally the proceeds from the issuance of our senior notes and the result of cash generated from operations these increases to cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were partially offset by cash used for repurchases of our common stock net of stock issuance proceeds acquisitions including business combinations and technology purchases capital expenditures and other investing activities 

the primary source for net cash provided by operating activities of  5591 million  for fiscal 2013  was net income of  2474 million  increased by the effect of noncash expenses totaling  2841 million  associated with depreciation amortization accretion and stockbased compensation in addition net cash flow used by changes in operating assets and liabilities was  101 million  the primary source of working capital was an increase in deferred revenue due to higher maintenance billings for fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012  the primary working capital uses of cash were increases in accounts receivable due to higher billings in fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012  our days sales outstanding in trade receivables was 74 at january 31 2013 compared to 61 at january 31 2012 the increase in days sales outstanding is due to higher billings in the last month of fiscal 2013 compared to the last month of fiscal 2012 

at january 31 2013  our shortterm investment portfolio had an estimated fair value of  3421 million  and a cost basis of  3378 million  the portfolio fair value consisted of  1230 million  invested in commercial paper and corporate securities  833 million  invested in us treasury securities  795 million  invested in us government agency securities  353 million  invested in mutual funds  151 million  invested in certificates of deposit and time deposits with remaining maturities at the date of purchase greater than 90 days and less than one year  46 million  invested in municipal securities  10 million  invested in sovereign debt and  03 million  invested in other shortterm securities 

at january 31 2013   353 million  of trading securities were invested in a defined set of mutual funds as directed by the participants in our deferred compensation plan see note 6  “ deferred compensation ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

longterm cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following the acquisition of businesses software products or technologies complementary to our business stock repurchases and capital expenditures including the purchase and implementation of internaluse software applications 

our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products technology and businesses acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers however they entail cost and integration challenges and may in certain instances negatively impact our operating margins we continually review these tradeoffs in making decisions regarding acquisitions we currently anticipate that we will acquire products technology and businesses as compelling opportunities become available in fiscal 2013 and 2012 we increased spend on acquisitions in comparison to previous years but our decision to acquire businesses or technology is dependent on our business needs the availability of suitable sellers and technology and our own financial condition 

our cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances are concentrated in a few locations around the world with substantial amounts held outside of the us certain amounts held outside the us could be repatriated to the us subject to local law restrictions but under current us tax law could be subject to us income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits we have provided for the us income tax liability on foreign earnings except for foreign earnings that are considered permanently reinvested outside the us our intent is that amounts related to foreign earnings permanently reinvested outside the us will remain outside the us and we will meet our us liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings or both we regularly review our capital structure and consider a variety of potential financing alternatives and planning strategies to ensure we have the proper liquidity available in the locations in which it is needed 

our existing cash cash equivalents and investment balances may decline in fiscal 2013 in the event of a weakening of the global economy or changes in our planned cash outlay cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the risks detailed in part i  item 1a  titled “ risk factors ” however based on our current business plan and revenue prospects we believe that our existing balances our anticipated cash flows from operations 



table of contents 

and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months our existing credit facility at march 18 2013  is  4000 million  of which we have no amounts outstanding this credit facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes in addition as of march 18 2013  we have  7500 million  aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding 

our revenue earnings cash flows receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our risk management strategy uses foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency volatility that exists as part of our ongoing business operations we use hedge contracts such as cash flow hedges to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions in addition we use hedge contracts such as balance sheet hedges to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables and payables as of january 31 2013  and 2012  we had open cash flow and balance sheet related hedge contracts with future settlements within one to twelve months contracts were primarily denominated in euros japanese yen swiss francs british pounds canadian dollars and australian dollars we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes the notional amount of our option and forward contracts was  4382 million  and  4947 million  at january 31 2013  and 2012  respectively 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at january 31 2013  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 



 

 

notes consist of senior notes issued in december 2012 the notes consisted of  4000 million  aggregate principal amount of 195  senior notes due december 15 2017  notes and  3500 million  aggregate principal amount of 36  senior notes due december 15 2022  

operating lease obligations consist primarily of obligations for facilities net of sublease income computer equipment and other equipment leases 

purchase obligations are contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services and are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on autodesk and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligations relate primarily to hosting services agreements it infrastructure costs and marketing costs 

deferred compensation obligations relate to amounts held in a rabbi trust under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan see note 6  “ deferred compensation ” in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this plan 

pension obligations relate to our obligations for pension plans outside of the us see note 14  “ retirement benefit plans ” in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these obligations 



table of contents 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months in addition we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees including limited product warranties historically costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant but because potential future costs are highly variable we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations 

issuer purchases of equity securities 

autodesks stock repurchase program is largely to help offset the dilution from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and for such other purposes as may be in the interests of autodesk and its stockholders and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders the number of shares acquired and the timing of the purchases are based on several factors including general market conditions the volume of employee stock option exercises stock issuance the trading price of our common stock cash on hand and available in the us and company defined trading windows during the three and twelve months ended january 31 2013  we repurchased 26 million  and 125 million  shares of our common stock respectively at january 31 2013  322 million  shares remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorizations this program does not have a fixed expiration date see note 9  “ stockholders equity ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of january 31 2013  we did not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements other than operating leases as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk

foreign currency exchange risk 

our revenue earnings cash flows receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our risk management strategy uses foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency volatility that exists as part of our ongoing business operations we use cash flow hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions in addition we use balance sheet hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables and payables as of january 31 2013  and 2012  we had open cash flow and balance sheet hedge contracts with future settlements within one to twelve months contracts were primarily denominated in euros japanese yen swiss francs british pounds canadian dollars and australian dollars we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes the notional amount of our option and forward contracts was  4382 million  and  4947 million  at january 31 2013  and 2012  respectively 

we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue and operating expenses of certain anticipated transactions a sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january 31 2013  indicated that a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 31 2013  and 2012  would increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by  296 million  and  453 million  respectively a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the dollar from its value at january 31 2013  and 2012  would decrease the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by  331 million  and  243 million  respectively 

interest rate risk 

interest rate movements affect both the interest income we earn on our short term investments and the market value of certain longer term securities at january 31 2013  we had  20070 million  of cash equivalents and marketable securities 



table of contents 

including  3421 million  classified as shortterm marketable securities and  4111 million  classified as longterm marketable securities if interest rates were to move up or down by 50 and 100 basis points over a twelve month period the market value change of our marketable securities would be  49 million  and  98 million  respectively 

other market risk 

from time to time we make direct investments in privately held companies the privately held companies in which we invest are considered inherently risky the technologies and products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize which could result in a loss of all or a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies the evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies and as such the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

our management evaluated with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended i is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and ii is accumulated and communicated to autodesk’s management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as such term is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended during the quarter ended january 31 2013  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2013  in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal control—integrated framework  our management has concluded that as of january 31 2013  our internal control over financial reporting is effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in item 8 herein 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within autodesk have been detected

product development and introduction 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware operating systems and software in addition our customers’ requirements and preferences rapidly evolve as do their expectations of the performance of our software to keep pace with these changes we maintain a vigorous program of new product development to address demands in the marketplace for our products we dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to further enhance our existing products and to create new products and technologies research and development expenditures were  5665 million  or 26  of fiscal 2012  net revenue  4962 million  or 25  of fiscal 2011  net revenue and  4575 million  or 27  of fiscal 2010  net revenue our software is primarily developed internally however we also use independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities additionally we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing or licensing products and technology from third parties we continually review these investments in an effort to ensure that we are generating sufficient revenue or gaining a competitive advantage to justify their costs 

the majority of our research and product development is performed in the united states china singapore and canada however we employ experienced software developers in many of our other locations translation and localization of our products are performed in a number of local markets principally singapore and switzerland we generally localize and translate our products into german french italian spanish russian japanese korean and simplified and traditional chinese 

we plan to continue to manage significant product development operations internationally over the next several years we believe that our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize product development lower costs and integrate local market knowledge into our development activities we continually assess the significant costs and challenges including intellectual property protection against the benefits of our international development activities 

table of contents 

in addition our business and our customers benefit from our relationships with a network of over 3600  thirdparty developers who develop and sell their own products that further enhance the range of integrated solutions available to our customers 

for further discussion regarding risks from our product development and introduction efforts see item 1a  “ risk factors ” 

marketing and sales 

we license or sell our products and services globally primarily through indirect channels consisting of distributors and resellers to a lesser extent we also transact directly with customers who are primarily large corporations our indirect channel model includes both a twotiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a onetiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers we have a network of approximately 2000  resellers and distributors worldwide for fiscal 2012  approximately 84  of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the future we employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our reseller channel with our business strategies sales through our largest distributor tech data corporation and its affiliates accounted for 17  16  and 14  of our net revenue for fiscal years 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively on october 27 2011 tech data purchased certain assets of mensch and maschine software “mum” which has been a distributor of our products in europe the acquisition concentrates additional sales through tech data which on a consolidated basis would have accounted for 21  22  and 21  of our net revenue for fiscal years 2012  2011  and 2010  if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of fiscal 2010 we believe our business is not substantially dependent on tech data including following the acquisition of certain assets of mum our customers through tech data are the resellers and end users who purchase our software licenses and services should any of the agreements between us and tech data be terminated for any reason we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue no other distributor or reseller accounted for 10 or more of our revenue 

our customerrelated operations are divided into three geographic regions the americas europe middle east and africa “emea” and asia pacific “apac” each geographic region is supported by global marketing and sales organizations these organizations develop and manage overall marketing and sales programs and work closely with a network of domestic and international sales offices fiscal 2012  net revenue in the americas emea and apac was  7985 million   8622 million  and  5549 million  respectively we intend to continue to make our products available in foreign languages we believe that international sales will continue to comprise the majority of our total net revenue adverse economic conditions in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance a summary of our financial information by geographic location is found in note 13  “ segments ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements our international operations and sales subject us to a variety of risks see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion 

we also work directly with reseller and distributor sales organizations computer manufacturers other software developers and peripherals manufacturers in cooperative advertising promotions and tradeshow presentations we employ massmarketing techniques such as webcasts seminars telemarketing direct mailings advertising in business and trade journals and social media we have a worldwide user group organization and we have created online user communities dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products 

in addition to sales of new software licenses we generate revenue through our maintenance program and upgrade pricing options these choices are available for a majority of our products and offer our customers two alternative means of migrating to the most recent version of our products 

under the maintenance program known by our user community as the autodesk subscription program customers who own a perpetual use license for the most recent version of the underlying product are able to purchase maintenance that provides them with unspecified upgrades whenandifavailable and are able to download elearning courses and receive online support over a one year or multiyear maintenance service period revenue from our maintenance program is reported separately on our consolidated statements of operations and is referred to throughout this document as maintenance revenue 

upgrade pricing offers customers who are not on our maintenance program an opportunity to purchase upgrades to the most current version of the same product for an incremental fee at current available prices but only to the extent that they are still on an autodesksupported version of our product an upgrade also includes a crossgrade where a customer pays an incremental fee at currently available prices toward the purchase of a different product which generally has a higher price the cost of an upgrade is less than the cost of purchasing a new license during fiscal 2012  customers could upgrade from software that is three versions prior to the latest version available or newer at a percentage of a full license the license of the previous version of the product is terminated revenue from upgrades are reported on our consolidated statements of operations in

“license and other” 

our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller networks the loss of or a significant reduction in business with any one of our major distributors or large resellers could harm our business see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion 

customer and reseller support 

we provide technical support and training to customers through a leveraged support model augmented by direct programs designed to address certain specific needs our customers rely primarily on the resellers and distributors from which they purchased licenses to our products for technical support however we do provide certain direct support for some of our customers we support our resellers and distributors through technical product training sales training classes the internet and telephone we also provide online support directly to our customers through our maintenance program there are also a number of user group forums in which customers are able to share information 

educational programs 

we offer education programs and specially priced software licensing options tailored for educational institutions students and faculty to train the next generation of users we also offer classroom support including standardized curricula developed by educators instructor development and a rich assortment of online learning resources users are trained on our products at educational institutions reducing the cost of training for our customers 

developer programs 

one of our key strategies is to maintain an openarchitecture design of our software products to facilitate thirdparty development of complementary products and industryspecific software solutions this approach enables customers and third parties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses we offer several programs that provide marketing sales technical support and programming tools to developers who develop addon applications for our products over 3600  developers in the autodesk developer network create interoperable products that further enhance the range of integrated solutions available to our customers 

competition 

the markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to rapid change we strive to increase our competitive separation by investing in research and development allowing us to bring new products to market and create exciting new versions of existing products that offer compelling efficiencies for our customers we also compete through investments in marketing and sales to more effectively reach new customers and better serve existing customers 

our competitors range from large global publicly traded companies to small geographically focused firms to solutions produced inhouse by their users our primary global competitors in these segments include adobe systems incorporated ansys inc bentley systems incorporated dassault systèmes sa and its subsidiary dassault systèmes solidworks corp environmental systems research institute inc esri google inc intergraph corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of hexagon ab nemetschek ag parametric technology corporation siemens product lifecycle software inc and trimble navigation limited 

our me segment also competes with a wide range of different companies from large global publiclytraded companies to small private entities large organizations that produce products that compete in some or all of our markets include adobe systems incorporated apple inc avid technology inc sony corporation and thomson among others the media and entertainment market is highly fragmented with complex interdependencies between many of the larger businesses as a result some of our competitors also own subsidiaries that are our customers or our partners in developing or bringing to market some of our solutions in addition to traditional competitors in developed economies we encounter new competitors in emerging economies 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing power with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the design software market is characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete both from existing competitors and by entry of competitors with innovative technologies competition is increasingly enhanced by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies and the possibility that competitors in one vertical segment may enter other vertical segments that we serve in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources than we do because of these and other factors competitive conditions in these industries are likely to continue to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and 

table of contents 

profit margins and loss of market share any of which could harm our business see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion of risks regarding competition 

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our abilities to better serve customers by offering new products whether by internal development or acquisition and to continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to ease of use reliability performance range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation price and training 

intellectual property and licenses 

we maintain an active program to legally protect our investment in technology through intellectual property rights we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions the nature and extent of legal protection associated with each such intellectual property right depends on among other things the type of intellectual property right and the given jurisdiction in which such right arises we believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business including each of our segments 

nonetheless our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws enforcement of intellectual property rights against alleged infringers can sometimes lead to costly litigation and counterclaims our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business 

from time to time we receive claims alleging infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights including patents disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to among other things costly litigation or product shipment delays which could harm our business 

we retain ownership of software we develop all software is licensed to users and primarily provided in object code pursuant to either shrinkwrap embedded or online licenses or signed license agreements these agreements contain restrictions on duplication disclosure and transfer 

we believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our intellectual property and the rapid ongoing technological changes in both the computer hardware and software industries we must rely principally upon software engineering and marketing skills to maintain and enhance our competitive market position 

while we have recovered some revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the full extent to which piracy of our software products exists we believe however that software piracy is and can be expected to be a persistent problem that negatively impacts our revenue and financial results 

in addition through various licensing arrangements we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others we expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing arrangements in the future as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions to support continued development and sales of our products and services some of these licensing arrangements require or may require royalty payments and other licensing fees the amount of these payments and fees may depend on various factors including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments offsetting considerations if any and the degree of use of the licensed technology 

see item 1a  “ risk factors ” for further discussion of risks related to protecting our intellectual property 

production and suppliers 

production of our pseb aec mfg and certain me software products involves duplication of the software media and for certain products the printing of user manuals the purchase of media and the transfer of the software programs onto media for distribution to customers are performed by us and by licensed subcontractors media for our products such as dvds and usb flash drives are available from multiple sources we offer our maintenance customers an electronic software download option for selected product updates customers who choose electronic fulfillment receive the latest version of the software from our vendor’s secure servers for certain products user manuals are made available by request only as we work toward reducing our cost of shipping and production as well as the use of natural resources user manuals and packaging materials are produced to our specifications by outside sources production is either performed in leased facilities operated by us or by independent thirdparty contractors to date we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the production of our software and documentation

employees 

as of january 31 2012  we employed approximately 7500  people none of our employees in the united states are represented by a labor union however in certain foreign countries our employees are represented by work councils we have never experienced any work stoppages and believe our employee relations are good reliance upon employees in other countries entails various risks and changes in these foreign countries such as government instability or regulation unfavorable to foreignowned businesses could negatively impact our business in the future 

acquistions 

over the past three years we acquired new technology or supplemented our technology by purchasing businesses or certain technology related assets focused in specific markets or industries for the three years ended january 31 2012  2011  and 2010  we acquired a number of companies and certain technology related assets some of which were accounted for as business combinations the following acquisitions have had a significant impact on our business 

  



backlog 

we have historically reported backlog as consisting of software license product orders that have not yet shipped and deferred revenue consisting primarily of deferred maintenance revenue from our maintenance program we no longer consider deferred revenue as part of backlog for further discussion of deferred revenue see the maintenance revenue  section of part ii item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

we typically ship products shortly after receipt of an order which is common in the software industry our backlog is primarily comprised of current software license product orders which have not yet shipped the category of current software license product orders which we have not yet shipped consists of orders from customers with approved credit status for currently available software products and may include both orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period 

backlog was  271 million  at january 31 2012 compared to  275 million  at january 31 2011 the actual amount of backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects as this amount is impacted by a number of factors not related to future trends or events such as the order fulfillment process the method of software delivery or the linearity of our business within the fiscal period

risk factors 

tableend we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks a number of which are beyond our control in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following discussion highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on our business financial condition and future results of operations if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted causing the trading price of our common stock to decline in addition these risks and uncertainties may impact the “forwardlooking” statements described elsewhere in this form 10k and in the documents incorporated herein by reference they could affect our actual results of operations causing them to differ materially from those expressed in “forwardlooking” statements 

current global economic uncertainty may impact our business financial results and financial condition   

as our business has expanded globally we have increasingly become subject to risks arising from adverse changes in global economic and political conditions the past several years have been characterized by weak global economic conditions a tightening in the credit markets high unemployment a low level of liquidity in many financial markets increased government deficit spending and debt levels uncertainty about certain governments abilities to repay such debt and extreme volatility in many financial instrument markets although some of these conditions appear to be abating there are a number of mixed indicators and it is not yet clear whether a sustainable recovery is occurring or a renewed slowdown is taking place 

over the past several years many of our customers have experienced tighter credit negative financial news and weaker financial performance of their businesses and have reduced their workforces thereby reducing the number of licenses and the number of maintenance contracts they purchase from us in addition a number of our customers rely directly and indirectly on government spending current debt balances of many countries without proportionate increases in revenues has caused many countries to reduce spending and in some cases has forced those countries to restructure their debt in an effort to avoid defaulting under those obligations this has not only impacted those countries but others that are holders of such debt and those assisting in such restructuring 

these actions may impact and over the past several years have negatively impacted our business financial results and financial condition in addition these factors may cause and over the past several years have caused us to restructure our business and in turn incur restructuring charges as well as take impairment charges on some of our longterm assets in addition the improvement of our financial performance over the past several fiscal quarters may be negatively impacted by 

 existing and increased competition and rapidly evolving technological changes may reduce our net revenue and profits 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing devices with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the markets in which we compete are characterized by vigorous competition both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources furthermore a reduction in the number and availability of compatible thirdparty applications or our inability to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes including those related to cloud computing mobile devices and new computing platforms may adversely affect the sale of our products because of these and other factors competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which would likely harm our business 

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer products that compete favorably with respect to reliability performance ease of use range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation and price 

table of contents 

our financial results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenue and financial results difficult to predict 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines in addition to the other factors described in this part i item 1a some of the factors that could cause our financial results to fluctuate include 

 we have also experienced fluctuations in financial results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic conditions in particular our financial results in europe during our third quarter are usually 

table of contents 

affected by a slower summer period and our asia pacific operations typically experience seasonal slowing in our third and fourth quarters 

  

our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenue and are relatively fixed in the short term accordingly any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability greater than anticipated expenses or a failure to maintain rigorous cost controls would also negatively affect profitability further gross margins may be adversely affected if our sales of creative finishing products and consulting services which historically have had lower margins grow at a faster rate than sales of our highermargin products and services 

  if we do not maintain good relationships with the members of our distribution channel or achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected if our distribution channel suffers financial losses becomes financially unstable or insolvent is negatively impacted by the recent consolidation between two important distributors or is not provided the right mix of incentives to sell our products our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected 

we sell our software products both directly to endusers and through a network of distributors and resellers for the fiscal year ended january 31 2012  approximately 84  of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the future our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller network computer software distributors and resellers typically are not highly capitalized have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and experienced difficulties during the past several years we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of distributors and resellers prior to our sales to them in the past we have taken steps to support them and may take additional steps in the future such as extending credit terms and providing temporary discounts these steps if taken could harm our financial results if our distributors and resellers were to become insolvent they would not be able to maintain their business and sales or provide customer support services which would negatively impact our business and revenue 

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including the distributor tech data corporation and its global affiliates “tech data” tech data accounted for 17  16  and 14  of our total net revenue for the fiscal years ended january 31 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively 

on october 27 2011 tech data purchased certain assets of mensch und maschine software “mum” in europe mum has been a european distributor of our products in that region the acquisition concentrates additional sales through tech data and on a consolidated basis would have accounted for 21  of our revenue for the fiscal year ended january 31 2012  respectively if the acquisition had occurred on february 1 2011 although we believe that we are not substantially dependent on tech data including following the acquisition of certain assets of mum if tech data were to experience a significant disruption with its business or if our relationship with tech data were to significantly deteriorate it is possible that our ability to sell to end users would be at least temporarily negatively impacted this could in turn negatively impact our financial results 

over time we have modified and will continue to modify aspects of our relationship with our distributors and resellers such as their incentive programs pricing to them and our distribution model to motivate and reward them for aligning their businesses with our strategy and business objectives changes in these relationships and underlying programs could negatively impact their business and harm our business in addition the loss of or a significant reduction in business with those distributors or resellers or the failure to achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough with any one of our major international distributors or large resellers could harm our business in particular if one or more of such distributors or resellers were unable to meet their obligations with respect to accounts payable to us we could be forced to write off such accounts and may be required to delay the recognition of revenue on future sales to these customers these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

a significant portion of our revenue is generated through maintenance revenue decreases in maintenance attach or renewal rates or a decrease in the number of new licenses we sell negatively impacts our future revenue and financial results 

our maintenance customers have no obligation to attach maintenance to their initial license or renew their maintenance contract after the expiration of their initial maintenance period which is typically one year our customers attach and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including overall global economy the health of their businesses and the perceived value of the maintenance program if our customers do not attach maintenance to their initial license or renew their maintenance contract for our products our maintenance revenue will decline and our financial results will suffer 

in addition a portion of the growth of our maintenance revenue has typically been associated with growth of the number 

table of contents 

of licenses that we sell any reduction in the number of licenses that we sell even if our customers attach rates do not change will have a negative impact on our future maintenance revenue this in turn would impact our business and harm our financial results 

we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the term of the maintenance contracts which is predominantly one year but may also range up to five years decreases in net maintenance billings will negatively impact future maintenance revenue however future maintenance revenue will also be impacted by other factors such as the amount timing and mix of contract terms of future billings 

we are dependent on international revenue and operations exposing us to significant regulatory global economic intellectual property collections currency exchange rate taxation political instability and other risks which could adversely impact our financial results 

we are dependent on our international operations for a significant portion of our revenue our international revenue including that from emerging economies is subject to general economic and political conditions in foreign markets including conditions in foreign markets resulting from economic and political conditions in the us our revenue is also impacted by the relative geographical and country mix of our revenue over time these factors have recently adversely impacted and may in the future adversely impact our international revenue and consequently our business as a whole further our dependency on international revenue makes us much more exposed to global economic and political trends which can negatively impact our financial results even if our results in the us are strong for a particular period 

we anticipate that our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue and as we expand our international development sales and marketing expertise will provide significant support to our overall efforts in countries outside of the us risks inherent in our international operations include fluctuating currency exchange rates including risks related to any hedging activities we undertake unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and practices delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology tariffs quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions transportation delays operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices particularly in emerging economies increasing enforcement by the us under the foreign corrupt practices act adoption of stricter anticorruption laws in certain countries including the united kingdom difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales and development operations longer collection cycles for accounts receivable potential changes in tax laws including possible us tax law changes that if enacted could significantly impact how us multinational companies are taxed on foreign subsidiary earnings tax arrangements with foreign governments including our ability to meet and review the terms of those tax arrangements and laws regarding the management of and access to data and public networks possible future limitations upon foreign owned businesses increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities inadequate local infrastructure greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property and other factors beyond our control including popular uprisings terrorism war natural disasters and diseases 

some of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks 

  

our business could suffer as a result of risks costs and charges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments 

we regularly acquire or invest in businesses software products and technologies that are complementary to our business through acquisitions strategic alliances or equity or debt investments the risks associated with such acquisitions include among others the difficulty of assimilating products operations and personnel inheriting liabilities such as intellectual property infringement claims the failure to realize anticipated revenue and cost projections the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business in accordance with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the diversion of managements time and attention our recent increase in the number of acquisitions further exacerbates these risks 

in addition such acquisitions and investments involve other risks such as 

 

table of contents 

 we may not be successful in overcoming such risks and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business in addition such acquisitions and investments have in the past and may in the future contribute to potential fluctuations in our quarterly financial results these fluctuations could arise from transactionrelated costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or writeoffs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments these costs or charges could negatively impact our financial results for a given period cause quarter to quarter variability in our financial results or negatively impact our financial results for several future periods 

the current global economic uncertainty may impact our business forcing us to take actions that could be costly and may not be as effective as we anticipate and may force us to take additional actions to reduce our expenses and stimulate demand for our products 

the current global economic uncertainty may lead to a reduction of our revenue levels and force us to take actions to reduce our cost structure to more closely align our costs with our reduced revenue levels over the past several years we have on several occasions taken such actions in taking any future restructuring actions we may incur and over the past several years have incurred additional costs that negatively impact our operating margins if we do not achieve the proper balance of these cost reduction initiatives we may eliminate critical elements of our operations the loss of which could negatively impact our ability to benefit from eventual economic growth 

in addition such global economic uncertainty and resulting impact on our business may cause us to take and over the past several years we have taken actions to stimulate demand for our products through a number of programs although we attempt to balance the cost of these programs against the longer term benefits it is possible that we will make such investments without corresponding increases in demand for our products and our revenue this would further reduce our operating margins and have a negative impact on our financial results 

  

net revenue or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline 

the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including the other factors described in this part i item 1a and the following 

 significant changes in the price of our common stock could expose us to additional costly and timeconsuming litigation historically after periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities a company becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts managements attention and resources 

our strategy to develop and introduce new product and service offerings including new product features exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance costs related to product defects and large expenditures that may not result in additional net revenue 

rapid technological changes as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences characterize the software industry we devote significant resources to the development of new technologies such as our design and entertainment products and our digital prototyping and collaboration products in addition we frequently introduce new business models or methods that require a considerable investment of technical and financial resources such as an increase in our portfolio of and focus on suites we are making such investments through further development and enhancement of our existing products as well as through acquisitions of new product lines such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs or competitors may introduce new products and services that achieve acceptance among our current customers adversely affecting our competitive position 

table of contents 

in particular a critical component of our growth strategy is to have customers of our autocad and autocad lt products expand their portfolios to include our suites over time we aim to migrate customers using standalone autodesk products to expand their portfolio with our suites offerings should sales of licenses of our autocad and autocad lt or standalone autodesk flagship products decrease without a corresponding increase in suites product revenue or without purchases of customer seats to our suites our results of operations will be adversely affected additionally the software products we offer are complex and despite extensive testing and quality control may contain errors or defects these errors or defects could result in the need for corrective releases to our software products damage to our reputation loss of revenue an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products any of which would likely harm our business 

further given the rapid speed of changing customer expectations and advancement of technology inherent in the software industry the extensive and complex efforts required to create useful and widely accepted products and the rapid evolution of cloud computing mobile devices new computing platforms and other technologies our executive management team must act quickly continuously and with vision although we have articulated a strategy that we believe will fulfill these challenges if we fail to execute properly on that strategy adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve fail to internalize and execute on that strategy we may fail to meet our customers expectations fail to compete with our competitors products and technology and lose the confidence of our channel partners and employees this in turn could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

from time to time we realign or introduce new business and sales initiatives if we fail to successfully execute and manage these initiatives our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

as part of our effort to accommodate our customers needs and demands and the rapid evolution of technology we from time to time evolve our business and sales initiatives such as realigning our development and marketing organizations and expanding our portfolio of suites and our offering of software as a service and realign our internal resources in an effort to improve efficiency we may take such actions without clear indications that they will prove successful market acceptance of any new business or sales initiative is dependent on our ability to match our customers needs at the right time and price often we have limited prior experience and operating history in these new areas of emphasis if any of our assumptions about expenses revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect or our attempts to improve efficiency are not successful our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated and our financial results will be negatively impacted 

because we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from a small number of products including our autocadbased software products including suites if these products are not successful our net revenue will be adversely affected 

we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from sales of licenses of a limited number of our products including autocad software products based on autocad which includes our suites that serve specific markets upgrades to those products and products that are interoperable with autocad any factor adversely affecting sales of these products including the product release cycle market acceptance product competition performance and reliability reputation price competition economic and market conditions and the availability of thirdparty applications would likely harm our financial results during the fiscal year ended january 31 2012  combined revenue from our autocad and autocad lt products not including suites having autocad or autocad lt as a component represented 33  of our total net revenue 

  

if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights our business could be harmed 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright and trademark laws trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software products or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our software products is timeconsuming and costly while we have recovered some revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists and we expect that software piracy will remain a persistent problem furthermore our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 

additionally we actively protect the secrecy of our confidential information and trade secrets including our source code if unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code the loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for thirdparties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our financial performance and our reputation we also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of nondisclosure agreements with our customers contractors vendors and partners however it is possible that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization if this were to occur it may be difficult andor costly for us to enforce our rights and our financial performance and reputation could be negatively impacted 

table of contents 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the us and we make certain business and resource decisions based on assumptions about foreign currency we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 

we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our earnings exposure and cash flow exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as part of our risk management strategy we use foreign currency contracts to manage a portion of our exposures of underlying assets liabilities and other obligations which exist as part of our ongoing business operations these foreign currency instruments have maturities that extend for 1 to 12 months in the future and provide us with some protection against currency exposures however our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our financial results 

the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period although our foreign currency cash flow hedge program extends beyond the current quarter in order to reduce our exposure to foreign currency volatility we do not attempt to completely mitigate this risk and in any case will incur transaction fees in adopting such hedging programs such volatility even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings 

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 

as more software patents are granted worldwide the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grow and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlap we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims infringement or misappropriation claims have in the past been and may in the future be asserted against us and any such assertions could harm our business additionally certain patent holders without products have become more aggressive in threatening and pursuing litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents any such claims or threats whether with or without merit have been and could in the future be timeconsuming to defend result in costly litigation and diversion of resources cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in addition such royalty or license agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms if at all which would likely harm our business 

our investment portfolio is composed of a variety of investment vehicles in a number of countries that are subject to interest rate trends market volatility and other economic factors if general economic conditions further cause interest rates to decline credit ratings of our investments to deteriorate or illiquidity in the financial marketplace we may continue to experience a decline in interest income an inability to sell our investments or impairment in the value of our investments 

it is our policy to invest our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in highly liquid instruments with and in the custody of financial institutions with high credit ratings and to limit the amounts invested with any one institution type of security and issuer however we are subject to general economic conditions interest rate trends and volatility in the financial marketplace that can affect the income that we receive from our investments the net realizable value of our investments including our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and our ability to sell them in the us for example the yields on our portfolio securities are very low due to general economic conditions any one of these factors could reduce our interest income or result in material charges which in turn could impact our overall net income and earnings per share 

if we were to experience a loss on any of our investments that loss may cause us to record an otherthantemporary impairment charge the effect of this charge could impact our overall net income and earnings per share in any of these scenarios our liquidity may be negatively impacted which in turn may prohibit us from making investments in our business taking advantage of opportunities and potentially meeting our financial obligations as they come due 

we are subject to legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries and we may be named in additional legal proceedings or become involved in regulatory inquiries in the future all of which are costly distracting to our core business and could result in an unfavorable outcome or a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or the trading price for our securities 

we are involved in legal proceedings and receive inquiries from regulatory agencies as the global economy has changed and our business has evolved we have seen an increase in litigation activity and regulatory inquiries like many other high technology companies the number and frequency of inquiries from us and foreign regulatory agencies we have received regarding our business and our business practices and the business practices of others in our industry have increased in recent years in the event that we are involved in significant disputes or are the subject of a formal action by a regulatory agency we could be exposed to costly and time consuming legal proceedings that could result in any number of outcomes while outcomes of such actions vary any claims or regulatory actions initiated by or against us whether successful or not could result in 

table of contents 

expensive costs of defense costly damage awards injunctive relief increased costs of business fines or orders to change certain business practices significant dedication of management time diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business in any of these cases our financial results could be negatively impacted 

a breach of security in our products or computer systems may compromise the integrity of our products harm our reputation create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results 

we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our product source code and computer systems there appears to be an increasing number of computer “hackers” developing and deploying a variety of destructive software programs such as viruses worms and the like that could attack our products and computer systems despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such programs it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk like all software products our software is vulnerable to such attacks the impact of such an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our software products cause errors in the output of our customers work allow unauthorized access to sensitive proprietary or confidential information of ours or our customers and other destructive outcomes if this were to occur our reputation may suffer customers may stop buying our products we could face lawsuits and potential liability and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to section 404 we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting the report contains among other matters an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 

while we have determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 31 2012  as indicated in our management report on internal control over financial reporting included in this annual report on form 10‑k we must continue to monitor and assess our internal control over financial reporting if our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and such weakness remains uncorrected at fiscal yearend we will be unable to assert such internal control is effective at fiscal yearend if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective at fiscal yearend or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or concludes that we have a material weakness in our internal controls we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which would likely have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 

in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements which if not accurate may significantly impact our financial results 

we make assumptions judgments and estimates for a number of items including the fair value of financial instruments goodwill longlived assets and other intangible assets the realizability of deferred tax assets and the fair value of stock awards we also make assumptions judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee related liabilities including commissions bonuses and sabbaticals and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions partner incentive programs product returns reserves allowances for doubtful accounts asset retirement obligations and legal contingencies these assumptions judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from our estimates and such differences could significantly impact our financial results 

changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business further such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective 

for example the usbased financial accounting standards board “fasb” is currently working together with the international accounting standards board “iasb” on several projects to further align accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies who are required to follow us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” under sec regulations and those who are required to follow ifrs outside of the us these efforts by the 

table of contents 

fasb and iasb may result in different accounting principles under gaap that may result in materially different financial results for us in areas including but not limited to principles for recognizing revenue and lease accounting 

in addition the sec has not yet made a determination regarding how or if ifrs will be incorporated into the financial reporting system for us companies a change in accounting principles from gaap to ifrs may have a material impact on the way in which we report financial results 

it is not clear if or when these potential changes in accounting principles may become effective whether we have the proper systems and controls in place to accommodate such changes and the impact that any such changes may have on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows in addition as we evolve and change our business and sales models we are currently unable to determine how these potential changes may impact our new models particularly in the area of revenue recognition 

our financial results could be negatively impacted if our tax positions are successfully challenged by tax authorities 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions our effective tax rate is based on our expected geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany transfer pricing and enacted tax rules significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis we believe our tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 

our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our success and ability to invest and grow depend largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical professional managerial sales and marketing personnel historically competition for these key personnel has been intense the loss of services of any of our key personnel including key personnel joining our company through acquisitions the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions and financial goals 

we rely on third party technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies our product and service development may be delayed and our financial results negatively impacted 

we rely on certain software that we license from third parties including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions these thirdparty software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and the software may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software can be developed identified licensed and integrated which would likely harm our business 

disruptions with licensing relationships and third party developers could adversely impact our business 

we license certain key technologies from third parties licenses may be restricted in the term or the use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business similarly we may not be able to obtain or renew license agreements for key technology on favorable terms if at all and any failure to do so could harm our business 

our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with thirdparty developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn in particular markets such disruptions have in the past and would likely in the future negatively impact these thirdparty developers and end users which could harm our business 

additionally technology created by outsourced product development whether outsourced to third parties or developed externally and transferred to us through business or technology acquisitions have certain additional risks such as effective integration into existing products adequate transfer of technology knowhow and ownership and protection of transferred intellectual property 

as a result of our strategy of partnering with other companies for product development our product delivery schedules could be adversely affected if we experience difficulties with our product development partners 

we partner with certain independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities we 

table of contents 

believe our partnering strategy allows us to among other things achieve efficiencies in developing new products and maintaining and enhancing existing product offerings our partnering strategy creates a dependency on such independent developers independent developers including those who currently develop products for us in the us and throughout the world may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future in addition use of development resources through consulting relationships particularly in nonus jurisdictions with developing legal systems may be adversely impacted by and expose us to risks relating to evolving employment export and intellectual property laws these risks could among other things expose our intellectual property to misappropriation and result in disruptions to product delivery schedules 

we rely on thirdparties to provide us with a number of operational services including hosting and delivery certain of our customer services operations as well as some of our operations any interruption or delay in service from these third parties breaches of security or privacy or failures in data collection could expose us to liability harm our reputation and adversely impact our financial performance 

we rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide our customers and computer operations for our internal use as we gather customer data and host certain customer data in thirdparty facilities a security breach could compromise the integrity or availability of customer data in addition our operations could be negatively affected in the event of a security breach and we could be subject to the loss or theft of confidential or proprietary information including source code 

unauthorized access to this data may be obtained through breakins breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party employee theft or misuse or other misconduct we rely on a number of third party suppliers in the operation of our business for the provision of various services and materials that we use in the operation of our business and production of our products although we seek to diversify our third party suppliers we may from time to time rely on a single or limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country for these services or materials the inability of such third parties to satisfy our requirements could disrupt our business operations or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy if any of these situations were to occur our reputation could be harmed we could be subject to third party liability including under data protection and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

  

we regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems disrupt our operations our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network and data center infrastructure internal technology systems and our websites for our development marketing operational support sales accounting and financial reporting activities we are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet the growing requirements of our business and customers such improvements are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or uncover problems with our existing technology systems unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in disruption in our business operations loss of revenue errors in our accounting and financial reporting or damage to our reputation 

our business may be significantly disrupted upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event 

our business is highly automated and relies extensively on the availability of our network and data center infrastructure our internal technology systems and our websites we also rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide to our customers and computer operations for our internal use the failure of our systems or hosted computer services due to a catastrophic event such as an earthquake fire flood tsunami weather event telecommunications failure power failure cyber attack or war could adversely impact our business financial results and financial condition we have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems in order to reduce the potential impact of a catastrophic event however there can be no assurance that these plans and systems would enable us to return to normal business operations in addition any such event could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products this could in turn decrease that countrys or regions demand for our products thereby negatively impacting our financial results

of training and providing fresh talent for our customers our global network of distributors resellers third party developers customers educational institutions and students has been developed over our twentynine  year history we believe it is an enduring competitive advantage that is difficult for others to replicate 

we continually strive to increase the business value of our design tools to our customers in a number of ways first we seek to address an increasing portion of our customers workflow with products that extend the value of our customers digital design information into visualization analysis and simulation second we seek to improve our product interoperability and usability thus improving our customers productivity and effectiveness third we continue to develop new ways to deliver capability and value to our customers such as product suites cloudbased services and delivery of our solutions on mobile devices and new hardware platforms fourth we extend our customers workflow with products for adjacent users and for the “customers of our customers” thus increasing the value of the design information our customers produce finally we continue to develop new lines of consumer products and services that are delivered and experienced through the web tablets and mobile devices providing our advanced visualization technologies to consumers—a whole new category of autodesk customer 

autodesk was founded during the platform transition from mainframes and engineering workstations to personal computers we developed and sustained a compelling value proposition based upon desktop software for the personal computer just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry thirty years ago we believe our industry is undergoing a similar transition from the personal computer to cloud mobile and social computing our growth strategy is predicated upon leading the transition in the industries we serve into the cloud in three ways 

 we believe that expanding our customers portfolios to include our suites presents a meaningful growth opportunity and is an important part of our overall strategy as our customers in all industries adopt our design suites we believe they will experience an increase in their productivity and the value of their design data for fiscal 2012  revenue from suites increased   31  as compared to the prior fiscal year as a percentage of revenue suites increased  to 27  in fiscal 2012  as compared to 23  in fiscal 2011  

expanding our geographic coverage is another key element of our growth strategy while emerging economies are important for all global businesses we believe they hold special opportunity for autodesk much of the growth in the world’s construction and manufacturing is happening in emerging economies further emerging economies face many of the challenges that our design technology can help address for example infrastructure buildout we believe that emerging economies continue to present longterm growth opportunities for us and revenue from emerging countries increased   16  during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  revenue from emerging countries represented 16  and 15  of fiscal 2012  and fiscal 2011  net revenue respectively while we believe there are longterm growth opportunities in emerging economies conducting business in these countries presents significant challenges including economic volatility geopolitical risk local competition intellectual property protection poorly developed business infrastructure scarcity of talent and software piracy 

our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products technology and businesses acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers however they entail cost and integration challenges and may in certain instances negatively impact our operating margins we continually review these tradeoffs in making decisions regarding acquisitions we currently anticipate that we will acquire products technology and businesses as compelling opportunities become available in fiscal 2012 we increased the number pace and dollars spent on acquisitions in comparison to fiscal 2011 but our decision to acquire businesses or technology is dependent on our business needs the availability of suitable sellers and technology and our own financial condition

our strategy depends upon a number of assumptions including that we will be able to continue making our technology available to mainstream markets leverage our large global network of distributors resellers thirdparty developers customers educational institutions and students improve the performance and functionality of our products and adequately protect our intellectual property if the outcome of any of these assumptions differs from our expectations we may not be able to implement our strategy which could potentially adversely affect our business for further discussion regarding these and related risks see part i  item 1a  “ risk factors ” 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we regularly reevaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we believe that of all our significant accounting policies the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 

for multiple element arrangements we allocate the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on their vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value vsoe is the price charged when an element is sold separately or a price set by management with the relevant authority if we do not have vsoe of an undelivered software license we defer revenue recognition on the entire sales arrangement until all elements for which we do not have vsoe are delivered if we do not have vsoe for undelivered maintenance or services the revenue for the arrangement is recognized over the longest contractual service period in the arrangement we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 

our assessment of likelihood of collection is also a critical factor in determining the timing of revenue recognition if we do not believe that collection is probable the revenue will be deferred until the earlier of when collection is deemed probable or payment is received 

our indirect channel model includes both a twotiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a onetiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers our product license revenue from distributors and resellers are generally recognized at the time title to our product passes to the distributor in a twotiered structure or reseller in a onetiered structure provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met this policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns among other criteria we are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers our policy also presumes that we have no significant performance obligations in connection with the sale of our product licenses by our distributors and resellers to their customers if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

marketable securities at january 31 2012  we had  4472 million  of short and longterm marketable securities marketable securities are stated at fair value as described in note 2  “ financial instruments ” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements we estimate the fair value of our marketable securities each quarter fair value is defined as an exit price representing the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when identical or similar assets are traded in active markets the level of judgment required to estimate their fair value is relatively low this is generally true for our cash and cash equivalents and the majority of our marketable securities which we consider to be level 1 assets and level 2 assets however determining the fair value of marketable securities when observable inputs are not available level 3 requires significant judgment for example we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our convertible debt securities because an active market does not exist for these securities which have been issued by private corporations these assumptions are inherently subjective and involve significant management judgment whenever possible we use observable market data and rely on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available when determining fair value 

table of contents 

business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to assets and liabilities as well as to inprocess research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date the purchase price allocation process requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations 

although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain examples of critical estimates used in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from sales maintenance agreements and acquired developed technologies the acquired company’s trade name and customer relationships as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and customer relationships will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio expected costs to develop the inprocess research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed and discount rates 

goodwill we test goodwill for impairment annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment when assessing goodwill for impairment we use discounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether goodwill is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge impairment charges if any result from instances where the fair values of net assets associated with goodwill are less than their carrying values as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

as of january 31 2012  a hypothetical 10 decrease in the fair value of our reporting units would not have an impact on the carrying value of goodwill nor result in impairment of goodwill for further discussion see note 1  “ business and summary of significant accounting policies ” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

realizability of longlived assets we assess the realizability of our longlived assets and related intangible assets other than goodwill annually during the fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review significant underperformance of a business or product line relative to budget shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends and the results of past impairment reviews 

we assess   recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows we would perform a discounted cash flow analysis to assess impairments on longlived assets variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge impairment charges if any result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values 

in addition to our recoverability assessments we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our longlived assets any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made as well as in subsequent quarters 

we will continue to evaluate the values of our longlived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

income taxes we currently have  1659 million  of net deferred tax assets primarily a result of tax credits net operating losses and timing differences for reserves accrued liabilities stock options purchased technologies and capitalized intangibles partially offset by the establishment of us deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries deferred tax liabilities associated with tax method change on advanced payments and valuation allowances against california and canadian deferred tax assets we perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets and believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors including intercompany transfer pricing adjustments any change in future profitability may require material adjustments to these net deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determination is made we believe our tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 

stockbased compensation  we measure stockbased compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award and recognize expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period we estimate 

table of contents 

the fair value of stockbased payment awards including grants of stock options and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model the determination of the fair value of a stockbased award on the date of grant using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors the riskfree interest rate for the expected term of the award and expected dividends the variables used in the model are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted as needed sharebased compensation cost for restricted stock is measured on the closing fair market value of our commons stock on the date of grant the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

legal contingencies  as described in part i  item 3  “ legal proceedings ” and part ii  item 8  note 8  “ commitments and contingencies ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations

overview of fiscal 2012   



our business grew year over year as evidenced by our increases in revenue gross profit and income from operations during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  net revenue increased   14  gross profit increased   13  and income from operations increased   31  contributing to the year over year increases in revenue were increases in revenue from new seat licenses maintenance revenue revenue for most of our major products all of our reportable segments and all of our geographies during fiscal 2012  as compared to the prior fiscal year the reasons for these increases are discussed below under the heading results from operations in addition we continued to make progress in controlling our operating costs which led to year over year improvements in profitability the 31  increase in income from operations in fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  was due to the increase in our net revenue while controlling the growth of operating expenses 

our total operating margin increased  as a percentage from 14  for fiscal 2011  to 16  for fiscal 2012  the increase in our operating margin was primarily due to net revenue increasing at a faster rate than the increase in our costs due to our cost containment efforts during fiscal 2012  net revenue increased   2638 million  or 14  for fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  while our operating expenses increased   1471 million  or 10  for fiscal 2012  the 10  increase in operating expenses in fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  was due to an increase in salaries and benefits related to increased headcount and the return of employee costs which were temporarily suppressed in the prior year through salary reductions employee incentives reductions and mandatory vacation and other costs associated with higher revenue these increases were partially offset by the decrease in restructuring charges of  121 million  

we believe net revenue for fiscal 2013  will increase by approximately 10 compared to fiscal 2012  we anticipate fiscal 2013  operating margin will increase by approximately 130 basis points compared to fiscal 2012  

we generate a significant amount of our revenue in the us japan germany the united kingdom and france included in the overall increase in revenue were impacts associated with foreign currency our revenue benefited from foreign exchange 

table of contents 

rate changes during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  had applicable exchange rates from fiscal 2011  been in effect during fiscal 2012  and had we excluded foreign exchange hedge gains and losses from fiscal 2012  “on a constant currency basis” net revenue would have increased   12  compared to the prior fiscal year during fiscal 2012  total spend defined as cost of revenue plus operating expenses increased   11  compared to the prior fiscal year as reported and increased   13  on a constant currency basis changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue total spend and income from operations in future periods we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on a portion of the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions but do not attempt to completely mitigate the impact of fluctuation of such foreign currency against the us dollar 

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including tech data corporation and its global affiliates collectively “tech data” tech data accounted for 17  and 16  of our consolidated net revenue during fiscal year 2012  and 2011  respectively on october 27 2011 tech data purchased certain assets of mensch und maschine software “mum” which has been a distributor of our products in europe the acquisition concentrates additional sales through tech data which on a consolidated basis would have accounted for 21  and 22  of our net revenue for fiscal years 2012  and 2011  respectively if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of fiscal 2011we believe our business is not substantially dependent on tech data our customers through tech data are the resellers and end users who purchase our software licenses and services should any of the agreements between us and tech data be terminated for any reason we believe the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to our revenue 

our primary goals for fiscal 2013  are to grow revenue and improve our operating margin percentage by delivering our marketleading products and solutions to our customers and investing in product functionality and new product lines including suites offerings however there can be no assurance that we will achieve our financial goals and improve our financial results additionally we believe that unemployment rates and the availability of credit to major industries we serve are important indicators for our business if global economic conditions deteriorate we may not achieve our financial goals 

revenue from flagship products was 58  of total net revenue during fiscal 2012  respectively and increased   8  for fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  revenue from suites was 27  of total net revenue for fiscal 2012  and increased   31  as compared to fiscal 2011  during fiscal 2012  we released our new design and creation suites that include english language versions of our autodesk design suite autodesk factory design suite autodesk product design suite autodesk building design suite autodesk entertainment creation suite autodesk infrastructure design suite and autodesk plant design suite as well as a japanese language version of our autodesk entertainment creation suite suites revenue and growth rates for suites consist primarily of revenue from our preexisting suite families such as inventor and revit suites revenue from new and adjacent products was 16  of total net revenue during the fiscal 2012  and increased   8  as compared to fiscal 2011 we anticipate as our new and existing customers migrate from our standalone products that our revenue from suites will increase as a percentage of revenue and that our revenue from our flagship and new and adjacent products will decline as a percentage of revenue 

at january 31 2012  we had  16041 million  in cash and marketable securities we completed fiscal 2012  with a higher deferred revenue balance and a higher accounts receivable balance as compared to fiscal 2011  our deferred revenue balance at january 31 2012  included  6333 million  of customer maintenance contracts which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the life of the contracts our maintenance contracts are for a term of one year but may be two or three year or occasionally as long as five year terms we repurchased 97 million  shares of our common stock for  3274 million  during fiscal 2012  comparatively we repurchased 90 million  shares of our common stock for  2803 million  during fiscal 2011

license and other revenue 

license and other revenue is comprised of two components all forms of product license revenue and other revenue product license revenue includes revenue from the sale of new seat licenses and upgrades other revenue consists of revenue from creative finishing consulting and training services and hosted technology solutions 

total license and other revenue increased   16  during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  this increase was primarily due to the 16  increase in revenue from commercial new seat licenses during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  during fiscal 2012  13  percentage points of the 16  increase was due to the increase in the number of seats sold and 3  percentage points was due to an increase in the average net revenue per seat commercial new seat revenue as a percentage of license and other revenue was 67  for both fiscal 2012  and 2011  

also contributing to the increase in license and other revenue during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  was the 14  increase in upgrade revenue upgrade revenue increased during fiscal 2012  in comparison to fiscal 2011 primarily due to an acad lt upgrade promotion during the first quarter of fiscal 2012 an increase in large enterprise transactions customers migrating from standalone products to suites and a promotion that was run related to the education solutions suites 

backlog related to current software license product orders that had not shipped at the end of the quarter decreased  by  04 million  during fiscal 2012  from  275 million  at january 31 2011  to  271 million  at january 31 2012  backlog from current software license product orders that we have not yet shipped consists of orders for currently available licensed software products from customers with approved credit status and may include orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period 

revenue from the sales of our services training and support included in “license and other revenue” represented less than 3  of net revenue for all periods presented

maintenance revenue 

our maintenance revenue relates to a program known by our user community as the subscription program our maintenance program provides our commercial and educational customers with a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of our new releases and enhancements when and if released during the term of their contracts under our maintenance program customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades when and if available downloadable training courses and online support we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the maintenance contract periods 

maintenance revenue increased   10  during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  primarily due to a 10  increase in commercial maintenance revenue the 10  increase in commercial maintenance revenue was due to an 8  percentage point increase in commercial enrollment during the corresponding maintenance contract term and a 2 percentage point increase in net revenue per maintenance seat commercial maintenance revenue represented 98  of maintenance revenue for both fiscal 2012  and 2011  total subscription program enrollment at january 31 2012  and 2011  consisted of about 32 million  users and 29 million  users respectively 

changes in maintenance revenue lag changes in net billings for maintenance contracts because we recognize the revenue from those contracts ratably over their contract terms our maintenance contracts are for a term of predominantly one year but may be two or three year or occasionally as long as five year terms net maintenance billings increased 19  during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  this increase was due to an increase in maintenance renewals new multiyear maintenance contracts and the impact from the upgrade promotions mentioned above in license and other revenue 

deferred revenue for fiscal 2012 and 2011 was  7192 million  and  5879 million  respectively deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred maintenance revenue to a lesser extent deferred revenue consists of deferred license and other revenue derived from hosted technology solutions consulting services and deferred license sales 

net revenue by geographic area 

net revenue in the americas geography increased  by 14  both as reported and constant currency basis during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  this increase was primarily due to a 14  increase in revenue from new seats during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  maintenance revenue increased 10  during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  this increase in our revenue in this geography was led by the us and canada 

net revenue in the emea geography increased  by 10  both as reported and constant currency basis during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  the increase was primarily due to a 14  increase in new seat revenue and a 6  increase in maintenance revenue the increase in our revenue in this geography was led by the russian federation belgium united kingdom and germany 

net revenue in the apac geography increased  by 19  or 12  on a constant currency basis during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  primarily due to a 20  increase in new seat revenue and a 21  increase in maintenance revenue net revenue expansion in the apac geography during fiscal 2012  occurred in virtually all countries led by japan and followed by australia and south korea 

net revenue in emerging economies increased  by 16  or 13 on a constant currency basis during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  primarily due to revenue from the russian federation india mexico and brazil this growth was a significant factor in our international sales growth during fiscal 2012  revenue from emerging economies represented 16  of net revenue for fiscal 2012  and 15  for fiscal 2011  

international net revenue represented 72  and 71  of our net revenue in fiscal 2012  and fiscal 2011  respectively we believe that international revenue will continue to comprise a majority of our total net revenue unfavorable economic conditions in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies have significantly affected and could continue to significantly affect our financial results for a given period even though we hedge a portion of our current and projected revenue additionally the us creditrating downgrade and weak global economic conditions that have been characterized by restructuring of sovereign debt high unemployment and volatility in the financial markets may impact our future financial results

cost of license and other revenue includes labor costs of order fulfillment and costs of fulfilling consulting and training services contracts and collaborative project management services contracts cost of license and other revenue also includes stockbased compensation expense direct material and overhead charges amortization of purchased technology professional services fees and royalties direct material and overhead charges include the cost of hardware sold mainly pcbased workstations for creative finishing in the me segment costs associated with transferring our software to electronic media printing of user manuals and packaging materials and shipping and handling costs 

cost of license and other revenue increased   15  during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  primarily due to increased support costs and lower margin consulting engagements cost of license and other revenue decreased   6  during fiscal 2011  as compared to fiscal 2010  primarily due to savings on shipping and handling costs resulting from the switch to a

lower cost vendor as well as an increase in electronic order fulfillment 

cost of maintenance revenue includes labor costs of providing product support to our maintenance customers including stockbased compensation expense for these employees rent and occupancy shipping and handling costs and professional services fees cost of maintenance revenue increased   22  during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  due to an increase in maintenance support headcount and increased annual fulfillment costs related to supplying usb flash drives of our suites products cost of maintenance revenue increased   74  during fiscal 2011  as compared to fiscal 2010  due to an increase in maintenance support headcount these increases were partially offset by savings on freight and materials costs as fewer maintenance customers require physical shipments than in the past due to electronic fulfillment 

cost of revenue at least over the near term is affected by the volume and mix of product sales mix of physical versus electronic fulfillment fluctuations in consulting costs amortization of purchased technology new customer support offerings royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products and employee stockbased compensation expense we expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars but to remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  

marketing and sales 



marketing and sales expenses include salaries bonuses benefits and stockbased compensation expense for our marketing and sales employees and the expense of travel entertainment and training for such personnel and the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue such as advertising trade shows and expositions and various sales and promotional programs marketing and sales expenses also include labor costs of sales and order processing sales and dealer commissions rent and occupancy and the cost of supplies and equipment 

marketing and sales expenses increased   9  during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  primarily due to higher employeerelated costs related to salaries and fringe benefits primarily associated with increased head count and the reinstatement of merit increases in fiscal 2012 marketing and sales expenses increased   6  during fiscal 2011  as compared to fiscal 2010  primarily due to higher employeerelated costs related to variable compensation including commissions bonuses and related fringe benefits variable compensation expenses increased as a result of exceeding our fiscal 2011 target revenue growth and operating margins growth targets more than we did in fiscal 2010 our annual incentive plans are based on forecasted revenue and operating margin with current year targets set at the beginning of the fiscal year these increases were partially offset by the decrease in advertising and promotion spending and stockbased compensation expense 

we expect to balance our need to invest in the marketing and sales of our products with our desire to actively manage our sales and marketing operating expenses as a result we expect marketing and sales expense to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  

research and development 



research and development expenses which are expensed as incurred consist primarily of salaries bonuses benefits and 

table of contents 

stockbased compensation expense for research and development employees and the expense of travel entertainment and training for such personnel rent and occupancy professional services such as fees paid to software development firms and independent contractors 

research and development expenses increased   14  during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  primarily due to an increase in salaries and fringe benefits primarily associated with increased headcount and the reinstatement of merit increases in fiscal 2012 and to an increase in professional service fees in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 research and development expenses increased   8  during fiscal 2011  as compared to fiscal 2010  primarily due to an increase in bonuses salaries and benefits 

we expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  as we continue to invest in product development and acquire new technology in fiscal 2013  

general and administrative 



general and administrative expenses include salaries bonuses benefits and stockbased compensation expense for our finance human resources and legal employees as well as professional fees for legal and accounting services amortization of acquisition related customer relationships and trade names expense of travel entertainment and training expense of communication and the cost of supplies and equipment 

general and administrative expenses increased   11  from fiscal 2011  to fiscal 2012  primarily due to an increase in amortization of acquisition related customer relationships and trade names and the increase in salaries primarily associated with increased head count and the reinstatement of merit increases in fiscal 2012 general and administrative expenses increased   2  from fiscal 2010  to fiscal 2011  primarily due to an increase in bonuses and salaries partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense 

we expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars but remain consistent as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012  

restructuring 



during fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 we initiated restructuring plans in order to further reduce operating costs these restructuring plans resulted in targeted global staff reductions of approximately 200 430 and 700 positions for fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively no leased facilities were consolidated as part of the fiscal 2011 restructuring plan the fiscal 2010 and 2009 restructuring plans resulted in the consolidation of approximately 32 and 27 leased facilities respectively in connection with these restructuring programs we recorded a favorable adjustment for changes in previous estimates of  13 million  in fiscal 2012 and we recorded restructuring related charges of  108 million  and  482 million  during fiscal 2011  and 

table of contents 

2010  respectively the onetime termination benefits for these three restructuring programs were substantially paid as of january 31 2011 we expect to pay the facilityrelated liabilities through fiscal 2018 see note 15  “ restructuring reserves ” in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

impairment of goodwill and intangibles 



we did not record an impairment charge during fiscal 2012  or 2011  during fiscal 2010  we recorded an impairment charge of 210 million representing the entire goodwill balance of our me segment as of april 30 2009 this goodwill balance related to our me segment’s fourth quarter fiscal 2009 acquisition of substantially all of the assets of softimage 

should our revenue and cash flow projections decline significantly in the future additional impairment charges may be recorded to goodwill as of january 31 2012  a hypothetical 10 decrease in the fair value of our reporting units would not have an impact on the carrying value of goodwill nor result in impairment of goodwill see note 1  “ business and summary of significant accounting policies ” in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

interest and other income net 

the following table sets forth the components of interest and other income net 



interest and other income net increased   67 million  during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  primarily due to improved foreign currency remeasurements the loss on foreign currency in fiscal 2012 and 2011 is primarily due to the impact of remeasuring foreign currency transactions into the functional currency of the corresponding entity the amount of gain loss on foreign currency is driven by the volume of foreign currency transactions and the foreign currency exchange rates for the period 

interest and investment income net fluctuates based on average cash and marketable securities balances average maturities and interest rates the decrease in interest and investment income net during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011  is primarily due to the decrease in the fair value of our trading securities that are marked to market each period 

interest and other income net decreased   185 million  during fiscal 2011  as compared to fiscal 2010  primarily due to foreign currency losses 

provision for income taxes 

we account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse 

our effective tax rate was 21 and 22 during fiscal 2012  and 2011  respectively our effective tax rate decreased one percentage point from fiscal 2011  to fiscal 2012  primarily due to an increase in tax benefits from foreign earnings taxed at different rates in fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011  partially offset by tax benefits associated with closure of audits in fiscal 

table of contents 

2011 

our effective tax rate was 22 and 32 during fiscal 2011  and 2010  respectively our effective tax rate decreased 10 percentage points from fiscal 2010  to fiscal 2011  primarily due to a change in expected future tax rates the establishment of the california valuation allowance in fiscal 2010  and a decrease in nondeductible stockbased compensation expense offset by a decrease in tax benefits from foreign earnings taxed at different rates in fiscal 2011  compared to fiscal 2010  during the first quarter of fiscal 2010  the state of california enacted legislation significantly altering california tax law as a result of the newly enacted legislation we expect that in fiscal years 2012  and beyond income subject to tax in california will be less than under prior tax law and accordingly deferred tax assets are less likely to be realized 

our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate research credits state income taxes the tax impact of stockbased compensation accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations us manufacturers deduction closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits changes in valuation allowances and changes in tax laws including possible us tax law changes that if enacted could significantly impact how us multinational companies are taxed on foreign subsidiary earnings a significant amount of our earnings is generated by our europe and asia pacific subsidiaries our future effective tax rates may be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates or we repatriate certain foreign earnings on which us taxes have not previously been provided   

at january 31 2012  we had net deferred tax assets of  1659 million  we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize these assets 

for additional information regarding our income tax provision and reconciliation of our effective rate to the federal statutory rate of 35 see note 4  “ income taxes ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

other financial information 

in addition to our results determined under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” discussed above we believe the following nongaap measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the fiscal years ended january 31 2012  2011  and 2010  our gross profit gross margin income from operations operating margin net income and diluted earnings per share on a gaap and nongaap basis were as follows in millions except for gross margin operating margin and per share data 



for our internal budgeting and resource allocation process we use nongaap measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis these nongaap measures do not include certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results we use nongaap measures in making operating decisions because we believe those measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our earning potential in addition these nongaap financial measures facilitate comparisons to our and our competitors historical results and operating guidance we also use these measures for purposes of determining companywide incentive compensation 

there are limitations in using nongaap financial measures because nongaap financial measures are not prepared in 

table of contents 

accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies the nongaap financial measures included above are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results in addition they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the nongaap financial measures we compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a gaap basis as well as a nongaap basis and also by providing gaap measures in our public disclosures the presentation of nongaap financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap the nongaap financial measures are meant to supplement and be viewed in conjunction with gaap financial measures we urge investors to review the reconciliation of our nongaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures included below and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business

table of contents 

our nongaap financial measures as set forth in the table above exclude the following 

stockbased compensation expenses  we exclude stockbased compensation expenses from nongaap measures primarily because they are noncash expenses and management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

amortization of purchased intangibles  we incur amortization of acquisitionrelated purchased intangible assets in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies the amortization of purchased intangibles varies depending on the level of acquisition activity and management finds it useful to exclude these variable charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

goodwill impairment  this is a noncash charge to writedown goodwill to fair value when there was an indication that the asset was impaired as explained above management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

restructuring charges  these expenses are associated with realigning our business strategies based on current economic conditions in connection with these restructuring actions we recognize costs related to termination benefits for former employees whose positions were eliminated and the closure of facilities and cancelation of certain contracts we exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing financial results in the current period 

establishment of a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets  this is a noncash charge to record a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets as explained above management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

discrete tax items  we exclude the gaap tax provision including discrete items from the nongaap measure of income and include a nongaap tax provision based upon the projected annual nongaap effective tax rate discrete tax items include income tax expenses or benefits that do not relate to ordinary income from continuing operations in the current fiscal year unusual or infrequently occurring items or the tax impact of certain stockbased compensation examples of discrete tax items include but are not limited to certain changes in judgment and changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years certain costs related to business combinations certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets or changes in tax law management believes this approach assists investors in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations 

income tax effects on the difference between gaap and nongaap costs and expenses  the income tax effects that are excluded from the nongaap measures relate to the tax impact on the difference between gaap and nongaap costs and expenses primarily due to stockbased compensation purchased intangibles and restructuring for gaap and nongaap measures 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of cash is from the sale of licenses to our products our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employeerelated expenses such as compensation and benefits as well as general operating expenses for marketing facilities and overhead costs in addition to operating expenses we also use cash to invest in our growth initiatives which include acquisitions of products technology and businesses and to fund our stock repurchase program see further discussion of these items below 

at january 31 2012  our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling  16041 million  and net accounts receivable of  3951 million  in addition we have a line of credit facility that permitted unsecured shortterm borrowings of up to  4000 million  that we entered into in may 2011 which replaced our previous 2500 million line of credit facility that would have expired in august 2012 during fiscal 2012  we had no borrowings or repayments under our current or prior line of credit facility this credit facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes and expires in may 2016  

our cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally our primary commercial banking relationship is with citibank and its global affiliates “citibank” in addition citibank is one of the lead lenders and agent in the syndicate of our 4000 million line of credit 

the increase in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities to  16041 million  at january 31 2012  from  14669 million  at january 31 2011  is principally the result of cash generated from operations and to a lesser extent the proceeds from the issuance of common stock following stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases these increases to cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were partially offset by cash used for repurchases of our common stock acquisitions including business combinations and technology purchases capital expenditures and other investing

activities cash generated from operations was positively impacted by higher net revenue 

the primary source for net cash provided by operating activities of  5735 million  for fiscal 2012  was net income of 2853 million  increased by the effect of noncash expenses totaling  2243 million  associated with depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation in addition net cash flow provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities was  967 million  the primary source of working capital was an increase in deferred revenue due to higher maintenance billings and an increase in accounts payable for fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011  the primary working capital uses of cash were increases in accounts receivable due to higher billings and the reduction of accrued expenses primarily related to accrued commissions in fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011  our days sales outstanding in trade receivables was 61 at january 31 2012 compared to 55 at january 31 2011 the increase in days sales outstanding is due to higher billings in the last month of fiscal 2012 compared to the last month of fiscal 2011 

at january 31 2012  our shortterm investment portfolio had an estimated fair value of  2544 million  and a cost basis of  2526 million  the portfolio fair value consisted of  1438 million  invested in commercial paper and corporate securities  382 million  invested in us government agency securities  315 million  invested in mutual funds  52 million  invested in certificates of deposit and time deposits with remaining maturities at the date of purchase greater than 90 days and less than one year  307 million  invested in us treasury securities  47 million  invested in municipal securities and  03 million  invested in other shortterm securities 

at january 31 2012   315 million  of trading securities were invested in a defined set of mutual funds as directed by the participants in our deferred compensation plan see note 6  “ deferred compensation ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

longterm cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following the acquisition of businesses software products or technologies complementary to our business stock repurchases and capital expenditures including the purchase and implementation of internaluse software applications 

our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products technology and businesses acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers however they entail cost and integration challenges and may in certain instances negatively impact our operating margins we continually review these tradeoffs in making decisions regarding acquisitions we currently anticipate that we will acquire products technology and businesses as compelling opportunities become available in fiscal 2012 we increased the number pace and dollars spent on acquisitions in comparison to fiscal 2011 but our decision to acquire businesses or technology is dependent on our business needs the availability of suitable sellers and technology and our own financial condition 

our cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances are primarily denominated and held in us dollar and are concentrated in a few locations around the world with substantial amounts held outside of the us we believe that such dispersion meets our business and liquidity needs certain amounts held outside the us could be repatriated to the us subject to local law restrictions but under current us tax law could be subject to us income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits we have provided for the us income tax liability on foreign earnings except for foreign earnings that are considered permanently reinvested outside the us our intent is that amounts related to foreign earnings permanently reinvested outside the us will remain outside the us and we will meet our us liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows external borrowings or both we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 

our existing cash cash equivalents and investment balances may decline in fiscal 2013 in the event of a weakening of the global economy or changes in our planned cash outlay cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the risks detailed in part i  item 1a  titled “ risk factors ” however based on our current business plan and revenue prospects we believe that our existing balances our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months our existing credit facility at march 15 2012  is 4000 million of which we have no amounts outstanding this credit facility is available for working capital and general corporate purposes 

our revenue earnings cash flows receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency volatility that exists as part of our ongoing business operations we utilize cash flow hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions in addition we use balance sheet hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables and payables as of january 31 2012  and 2011  we had open cash flow and balance sheet hedge contracts with future settlements within one to twelve months contracts were primarily denominated in euros japanese yen swiss francs british pounds

canadian dollars and australian dollars we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes the notional amount of our option and forward contracts was  4947 million  and  4016 million  at january 31 2012  and 2011  respectively 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at january 31 2012  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 



 

 operating lease obligations consist primarily of obligations for facilities net of sublease income computer equipment and other equipment leases 

purchase obligations are contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services and are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on autodesk and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligations relate primarily to hosting services agreements it infrastructure costs and marketing costs 

deferred compensation obligations relate to amounts held in a rabbi trust under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan see note 6  “ deferred compensation ” in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this plan 

pension obligations relate to our obligations for pension plans outside of the us see note 14  “ retirement benefit plans ” in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these obligations 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months in addition we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees including limited product warranties historically costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant but because potential future costs are highly variable we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations 

issuer purchases of equity securities 

the purpose of the stock repurchase program is largely to help offset the dilution from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and for such other purposes as may be in the interests of autodesk and its stockholders and has the effect 

table of contents 

of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders the number of shares acquired and the timing of the purchases are based on several factors including general market conditions the volume of employee stock option exercises stock issuance the trading price of our common stock cash on hand and available in the us and company defined trading windows there were 20 million  repurchases of our common stock during the three months ended january 31 2012  during the fiscal year ended january 31 2012  we repurchased 97 million  shares of our common stock at january 31 2012  147 million  shares remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization this program does not have a fixed expiration date see note 9  “ stockholders equity ” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than operating leases we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing arrangements or have any variableinterest entities as of january 31 2012  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend foreign currency exchange risk 

our revenue earnings cash flows receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency volatility that exists as part of our ongoing business operations we utilize cash flow hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions in addition we use balance sheet hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables and payables as of january 31 2012  and 2011  we had open cash flow and balance sheet hedge contracts with future settlements within one to twelve months contracts were primarily denominated in euros japanese yen swiss francs british pounds canadian dollars and australian dollars we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes the notional amount of our option and forward contracts was  4947 million  and  4016 million  at january 31 2012  and 2011  respectively 

we utilize foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue and operating expenses of certain anticipated transactions a sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january 31 2012  indicated that a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 31 2012  and 2011  would increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by  453 million  and  316 million  respectively a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the dollar from its value at january 31 2012  and 2011  would decrease the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by  243 million  and  266 million  respectively 

interest rate risk 

interest rate movements affect both the interest income we earn on our short term investments and to a lesser extent the market value of certain longer term securities at january 31 2012  we had  13008 million  of cash equivalents and marketable securities with an average investment balance for the quarter of approximately  12365 million  if interest rates were to change by 10 this would result in a  02 million  change in annual interest income further at january 31 2012  we had approximately  2115 million  invested in a longer term portfolio with remaining maturities that may be less than one year which with 50 and 100 basis point moves would result in market value changes gains or losses of  20 million  and  40 million  respectively over a twelve month period at january 31 2011  we had  11499 million  of cash equivalents and marketable securities with an average investment balance for the quarter of approximately  8100 million  if interest rates were to change by 10 this would result in a  02 million  change in annual interest income further at january 31 2011  we had approximately  2850 million  invested in a longer term portfolio with remaining maturities that may be less than one year which with 50 and 100 basis point moves would result in market value changes gains or losses of  09 million  and  18 million  respectively over a twelve month period

our management evaluated with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 i is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and ii is accumulated and communicated to autodesk’s management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as such term is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended during the quarter ended january 31 2012  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2012  in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal control—integrated framework  our management has concluded that as of january 31 2012  our internal control over financial reporting is effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in item 8 herein 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within autodesk have been detected

product development and introduction 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware operating systems and software in addition our customers’ requirements and preferences rapidly evolve as do their expectations of the performance of our software to keep pace with these changes we maintain a vigorous program of new product development to address demands in the marketplace for our products we dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to further enhance our existing products and to create new products and technologies research and development expenditures were 4962 million or 25 of fiscal 2011 net revenue 4575 million or 27 of fiscal 2010 net revenue and 5761 million or 25 of fiscal 2009 net revenue our software is primarily developed internally however we also use independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities additionally we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing or licensing products and technology from third parties we continually review these investments in an effort to ensure that we are generating sufficient revenue or gaining a competitive advantage to justify their costs 

the majority of our research and product development is performed in the united states china singapore and canada however we employ experienced software developers in many of our other locations translation and localization of our products are performed in a number of local markets principally singapore and switzerland we generally localize and translate our products into german french italian spanish russian japanese korean and simplified and traditional chinese 

we plan to continue to manage significant product development operations internationally over the next several years we believe that our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize product development lower costs and integrate local market knowledge into our development activities we continually assess the significant costs and challenges including intellectual property protection against the benefits of our international development activities 

in addition our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with a network of over 3500 thirdparty developers who develop and sell their own products that further enhance the range of integrated solutions available to our customers 

for further discussion regarding risks from our product development and introduction efforts see item 1a “risk factors” 

  

 marketing and sales 

we license or sell our products and services globally primarily through indirect channels consisting of distributors and resellers to a lesser extent we also transact directly with customers who are primarily large corporations our indirect channel model includes both a twotiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a onetiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers we have a network of approximately 2000 resellers and distributors worldwide for fiscal 2011 approximately 85 of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the future we employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our reseller channel with our business strategies sales through tech data corporation and its affiliates accounted for 16 14 and 14 of our net revenue for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively we believe our business is not substantially dependent on tech data our actual customers through tech data are the resellers and end users who purchase our software licenses and services should any of the agreements between us and tech data be terminated for any reason we believe that arrangements could be made so that the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to us no other distributor or reseller accounted for 10 or more of our revenue 

our customerrelated operations are divided into three geographic regions the americas europe middle east and africa “emea” and asia pacific “apac” each geographic region is supported by global marketing and sales organizations these organizations develop and manage overall marketing and sales programs and work closely with a network of domestic and international sales offices fiscal 2011 net revenue in the americas emea and apac was 7015 million 7828 million and 4675 million respectively we intend to continue to make our products available in foreign languages we believe that international sales will continue to comprise the majority of our total net revenue adverse economic conditions in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance a summary of our financial information by geographic location is found in note 13 “segments” in the notes to consolidated financial statements our international operations and sales subject us to a variety of risks see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

we also work directly with reseller and distributor sales organizations computer manufacturers other software developers and peripherals manufacturers in cooperative advertising promotions and tradeshow presentations we employ massmarketing techniques such as web casts seminars telemarketing direct mailings advertising in business and trade journals and social media we have a worldwide user group organization and we have created online user communities dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products 

in addition to sales of new software licenses we generate revenue through our maintenance program and upgrade pricing options these choices are available for a majority of our products and offer our customers two alternative means of migrating to the most recent version of our products 

under the maintenance program known by our user community as the autodesk subscription program customers who own a perpetual use license for the most recent version of the underlying product are able to purchase maintenance that provides them with unspecified upgrades whenandifavailable and are able to download elearning courses and receive online support over a one year or multiyear maintenance service period revenue from our maintenance program is reported separately on our consolidated statements of operations and is referred to throughout this document as maintenance revenue 

upgrade pricing offers customers who are not on our maintenance program an opportunity to purchase upgrades to the most current version of the same product at current available prices but only to the extent that they are still on an autodesksupported version of our product an existing customer whether or not on maintenance also has the option to upgrade for a premium fee to a different vertical or modelbased design 

  

product which generally has a higher price we refer to this as a crossgrade the cost of a crossgrade is less than the cost of purchasing a new license during most of fiscal 2011 customers could upgrade or crossgrade from the three previous software releases at a percentage of a full license revenue from upgrades and crossgrades are reported on our consolidated statements of operations in “license and other” 

our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller networks the loss of or a significant reduction in business with any one of our major distributors or large resellers could harm our business see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

customer and reseller support 

we provide technical support and training to customers through a leveraged support model augmented by direct programs designed to address certain specific needs our customers rely primarily on the resellers and distributors from which they purchased licenses to our products for technical support however we do provide certain direct support for some of our customers we support our resellers and distributors through technical product training sales training classes the internet and telephone we also provide online support directly to our customers through our maintenance program there are also a number of user group forums in which customers are able to share information 

educational programs 

we offer education programs and specially priced software licensing options tailored for educational institutions students and faculty to train the next generation of users we also offer classroom support including standardized curricula developed by educators instructor development and a rich assortment of online learning resources users are trained on our products at educational institutions reducing the cost of training for our customers 

developer programs 

one of our key strategies is to maintain an openarchitecture design of our software products to facilitate thirdparty development of complementary products and industryspecific software solutions this approach enables customers and third parties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses we offer several programs that provide marketing sales technical support and programming tools to developers who develop addon applications for our products over 3500 developers in the autodesk developer network create interoperable products that further enhance the range of integrated solutions available to our customers 

backlog 

we typically ship products shortly after receipt of an order which is common in the software industry our aggregate backlog is primarily comprised of deferred revenue deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred maintenance revenue from our maintenance program to a lesser extent deferred revenue consists of deferred license and other revenue derived from collaborative project management services consulting services and deferred license sales backlog also includes current software license product orders which have not yet shipped the category of current software license product orders which we have not yet shipped consists of orders from customers with approved credit status for currently available software products and may include both orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period 

aggregate backlog was 6154 million at january 31 2011 of which 5879 million was deferred revenue and 275 million related to current software license product orders which had not yet shipped at the end of the fiscal year aggregate backlog was 5425 million at january 31 2010 of which 5165 million was deferred revenue and 260 million related to current software license product orders which had not yet shipped at the end of the fiscal year deferred revenue increased over the prior year primarily due to an increase in new and renewal maintenance contracts during fiscal 2011 

  

 competition 

the markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to rapid change we strive to increase our competitive separation by investing in research and development allowing us to bring new products to market and create exciting new versions of existing products that offer compelling efficiencies for our customers we also compete through investments in marketing and sales to more effectively reach new customers and better serve existing customers 

our competitors range from large global publicly traded companies to small geographically focused firms to solutions produced inhouse by their users our primary global competitors in these segments include adobe systems incorporated ansys inc bentley systems incorporated dassault systèmes sa and its subsidiary dassault systèmes solidworks corp environmental systems research institute inc esri google inc intergraph corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of hexagon ab nemetschek ag parametric technology corporation and siemens product lifecycle software inc 

our me segment also competes with a wide range of different companies from large global publiclytraded companies to small private entities large organizations that produce products that compete in some or all of our markets include adobe systems incorporated apple inc avid technology inc sony corporation and thomson the media and entertainment market is highly fragmented with complex interdependencies between many of the larger businesses as a result some of our competitors also own subsidiaries that are our customers or our partners in developing or bringing to market some of our solutions in addition to traditional competitors in developed economies we encounter new competitors in emerging economies 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing power with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the design software market is characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete both from existing competitors and by entry of competitors with innovative technologies competition is increasingly enhanced by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies and the possibility that competitors in one vertical segment may enter other vertical segments that we serve in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources than we do because of these and other factors competitive conditions in these industries are likely to continue to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which could harm our business see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion of risks regarding competition 

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our abilities to better serve customers by offering new products whether by internal development or acquisition and to continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to ease of use reliability performance range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation price and training 

intellectual property and licenses 

we maintain an active program to legally protect our investment in technology through intellectual property rights we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions the nature and extent of legal protection associated with each such intellectual property right depends on among other things the type of intellectual property right and the given jurisdiction in which such right arises we believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business including each of our segments 

nonetheless our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws enforcement of intellectual property rights against alleged infringers can sometimes lead to costly litigation and counterclaims our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business 

  

from time to time we receive claims alleging infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights including patents disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to among other things costly litigation or product shipment delays which could harm our business 

we retain ownership of software we develop all software is licensed to users and primarily provided in object code pursuant to either shrinkwrap embedded or online licenses or signed license agreements these agreements contain restrictions on duplication disclosure and transfer 

we believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our intellectual property and the rapid ongoing technological changes in both the computer hardware and software industries we must rely principally upon software engineering and marketing skills to maintain and enhance our competitive market position 

while we have recovered some revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the full extent to which piracy of our software products exists we believe however that software piracy is and can be expected to be a persistent problem that negatively impacts our revenue and financial results 

in addition through various licensing arrangements we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others we expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing arrangements in the future as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions to support continued development and sales of our products and services some of these licensing arrangements require or may require royalty payments and other licensing fees the amount of these payments and fees may depend on various factors including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments offsetting considerations if any and the degree of use of the licensed technology 

see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion of risks related to protecting our intellectual property 

production and suppliers 

production of our pseb aec mfg and certain me software products involves duplication of the software media and for certain products the printing of user manuals the purchase of media and the transfer of the software programs onto media for distribution to customers are performed by us and by licensed subcontractors media for our products such as dvds and usb flash drives are available from multiple sources we offer our maintenance customers an electronic software download option for selected product updates customers who choose electronic fulfillment receive the latest version of the software from our vendor’s secure servers for certain of our products user manuals are made available by request only as we work toward reducing our cost of shipping and production as well as the use of natural resources user manuals and packaging materials are produced to our specifications by outside sources production is either performed in leased facilities operated by us or by independent thirdparty contractors to date we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the production of our software and documentation 

employees 

as of january 31 2011 we employed approximately 6800 people none of our employees in the united states are represented by a labor union however in certain foreign countries our employees are represented by work councils we have never experienced any work stoppages and believe our employee relations are good reliance upon employees in other countries entails various risks that possible government instability or regulation unfavorable to foreignowned businesses could negatively impact our business in the future 

  

 business combinations 

over the past three years we acquired new technology or supplemented our technology by purchasing businesses focused in specific markets or industries for the three years ended january 31 2011 2010 and 2009 we acquired a number of companies including the following companies that have a significant impact on our business

 item 1a risk factors tableend we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks a number of which are beyond our control in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following discussion highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on our business financial condition and future results of operations if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted causing the trading price of our common stock to decline in addition these risks and uncertainties may impact the “forwardlooking” statements described elsewhere in this form 10k and in the documents incorporated herein by reference they could affect our actual results of operations causing them to differ materially from those expressed in “forwardlooking” statements 

any deceleration or reversal of the current global economic recoveries may impact our business financial results and financial condition 

as our business has expanded globally we have increasingly become subject to risks arising from adverse changes in global economic and political conditions the past two years have been characterized by weak global economic conditions a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets increased government deficit spending and debt levels and extreme volatility in many financial instrument markets although some of these conditions appear to be abating and a global recovery seems to be underway it is not yet clear whether a sustainable recovery is currently taking place on a worldwide basis 

any deceleration or reversal of the relatively slow and modest economic recovery taking place may cause our customers to defer reduce or cancel purchases over the past several years many of our customers have experienced tighter credit negative financial news and weaker financial performance of their businesses and have reduced their workforces thereby reducing the number of licenses and the number of maintenance contracts they purchase from us 

these actions may impact and over the past several years have negatively impacted our business financial results and financial condition in addition these factors may cause and over the past several years have caused us to restructure our business and in turn incur restructuring charges as well as take impairment charges on some of our longterm assets in addition the improvement of our financial performance over the past several fiscal quarters may be negatively impacted by 

 

  

  

  

  

 the actions that we may be forced to take in the event of any deceleration or reversal of the current domestic and global economic recoveries could be costly and may not be as effective as we anticipate and may force us to take additional actions to reduce our expenses and stimulate demand for our products 

any deceleration or reversal of the current domestic and global economic recoveries may reduce our revenue levels and force us to take actions to reduce our cost structure to more closely align our costs with our reduced revenue levels over the past several years we have on several occasions taken such actions in taking any future restructuring actions we may incur and over the past several years have incurred additional costs that 

  

negatively impact our operating margins if we do not achieve the proper balance of these cost reduction initiatives we may eliminate critical elements of our operations the loss of which could negatively impact our ability to benefit from eventual economic growth 

in addition any deceleration or reversal of the current domestic and global economic recoveries may cause us to take and over the past several years we have taken actions to stimulate demand for our products through a number of programs although we are attempting to balance the cost of these programs against the longer term benefits it is possible that we will make such investments without corresponding increases in demand for our products and our revenue this would further reduce our operating margins and have a negative impact on our financial results 

a significant portion of our revenue is generated through maintenance revenue decreases in maintenance attach or renewal rates or a decrease in the number of new licenses we sell negatively impacts our future revenue and financial results 

our maintenance customers have no obligation to attach maintenance to their initial license or renew their maintenance contract after the expiration of their initial maintenance period which is typically one year our customers’ attach and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including overall global economy the health of their businesses and the perceived value of the maintenance program if our customers do not attach maintenance to their initial license or renew their maintenance contract for our products our maintenance revenue will decline and our financial results will suffer 

in addition a portion of the growth of our maintenance revenue has typically been associated with growth of the number of licenses that we sell any reduction in the number of licenses that we sell even if our customers’ attach rates do not change will have a negative impact on our future maintenance revenue this in turn would impact our business and harm our financial results 

we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the term of the maintenance contracts which is predominantly one year but may also range up to five years decreases in net maintenance billings will negatively impact future maintenance revenue however future maintenance revenue will also be impacted by other factors such as the amount timing and mix of contract terms of future billings 

our financial results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenue and financial results difficult to predict 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines in addition to the other factors described in this part i item 1a some of the factors that could cause our financial results to fluctuate include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we have also experienced fluctuations in financial results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic conditions in particular our financial results in europe during our third quarter are usually affected by a slow summer period and our asia pacific operations typically experience seasonal slowing in our third and fourth quarters 

our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenue and are relatively fixed in the short term accordingly any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability greater than anticipated expenses or a failure to maintain rigorous cost controls would also negatively affect profitability further gross margins may be adversely affected if our sales of creative finishing products which historically have had lower margins grow at a faster rate than sales of our highermargin products 

net revenue or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline 

the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 significant changes in the price of our common stock could expose us to additional costly and timeconsuming litigation historically after periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities a company becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management’s attention and resources 

we are dependent on international revenue and operations exposing us to significant regulatory global economic intellectual property collections currency exchange rate taxation political instability and other risks which could adversely impact our financial results 

we are dependent on our international operations for a significant portion of our revenue our international revenue including that from emerging economies is subject to general economic and political conditions in foreign markets including conditions in foreign markets resulting from economic and political conditions in the us our revenue is also impacted by the relative geographical and country mix of our revenue over time these factors have recently adversely impacted and may in the future adversely impact our international revenue and consequently our business as a whole further our dependency on international revenue makes us much more exposed to global economic and political trends which can negatively impact our financial results even if our results in the us are strong for a particular period 

we anticipate that our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue and as we expand our international development sales and marketing expertise will provide significant support to our overall efforts in countries outside of the us risks inherent in our international operations include fluctuating currency exchange rates including risks related to any hedging activities we undertake unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and practices delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology tariffs quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions transportation delays operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices particularly in emerging economies increasing enforcement by the us under the foreign currupt practices act adoption of stricter anticorruption laws in certain countries including the united kingdom difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales and development operations longer collection cycles for accounts receivable potential changes in tax laws tax arrangements with foreign governments including our ability to meet and review the terms of those tax arrangements and laws regarding the management of data possible future limitations upon foreign owned businesses increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities inadequate local infrastructure greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property and other factors beyond our control including popular uprisings terrorism war natural disasters and diseases 

existing and increased competition and rapidly evolving technological changes may reduce our net revenue and profits 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing devices with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the markets in which we compete are characterized by vigorous competition both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies in 

  

 addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources furthermore a reduction in the number and availability of compatible thirdparty applications or our inability to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes including those related to cloud computing mobile devices and new computing platforms may adversely affect the sale of our products because of these and other factors competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future increased competition could result in continued price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which would likely harm our business 

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer products that compete favorably with respect to reliability performance ease of use range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation and price 

our business could suffer as a result of risks costs and charges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments 

we regularly acquire or invest in businesses software products and technologies that are complementary to our business through acquisitions strategic alliances or equity investments the risks associated with such acquisitions include among others the difficulty of assimilating products operations and personnel inheriting liabilities such as intellectual property infringement claims the failure to realize anticipated revenue and cost projections the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business in accordance with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the diversion of management’s time and attention 

in addition such acquisitions and investments involve other risks such as 

 

  

  

  

  

 we may not be successful in overcoming such risks and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business in addition such acquisitions and investments have in the past and may in the future contribute to potential fluctuations in our quarterly financial results these fluctuations could arise from transactionrelated costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or writeoffs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments these costs or charges could negatively impact our financial results for a given period cause quarter to quarter variability in our financial results or negatively impact our financial results for several future periods 

because we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from a small number of products including our autocadbased software products if these products are not successful our net revenue will be adversely affected 

we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from sales of licenses of a small number of our products including autocad software products based on autocad that serve specific vertical markets upgrades to those products and products that are interoperable with autocad any factor adversely affecting sales of these products including the product release cycle market acceptance product competition performance and reliability reputation price competition economic and market conditions and the availability of thirdparty applications would likely harm our financial results during the fiscal year ended january 31 2011 combined revenue from our autocad and autocad lt products represented 33 of our consolidated net revenue 

  

our strategy to develop and introduce new product and service offerings including new product features exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance costs related to product defects and large expenditures that may not result in additional net revenue 

rapid technological changes as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences characterize the software industry we devote significant resources to the development of new technologies such as our vertical design products and our digital prototyping and collaboration products in addition we frequently introduce new business models or methods that require a considerable investment of technical and financial resources such as an increase in our portfolio of and focus on suites we are making such investments through further development and enhancement of our existing products as well as through acquisitions of new product lines such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs or competitors may introduce new products and services that achieve acceptance among our current customers adversely affecting our competitive position 

in particular a critical component of our growth strategy is to have customers of our autocad and autocad lt products expand their portfolios to include our related vertical design products and our modelbased design products and our suites over time we aim to migrate customers using standalone autodesk products to expand their portfolio with our suites offerings should sales of licenses of our autocad and autocad lt or standalone autodesk products decrease without a corresponding increase in vertical design and modelbased design product revenue or without purchases of customer seats to our vertical design products and modelbased design products or suites our results of operations will be adversely affected additionally the software products we offer are complex and despite extensive testing and quality control may contain errors or defects these errors or defects could result in the need for corrective releases to our software products damage to our reputation loss of revenue an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products any of which would likely harm our business 

further given the rapid speed of changing customer expectations and advancement of technology inherent in the software industry the extensive and complex efforts required to create useful and widely accepted products and the rapid evolution of cloud computing mobile devices new computing platforms and other technologies our executive management team must act quickly continuously and with vision although we have articulated a strategy that we believe will fulfill these challenges if we fail to execute properly on that strategy adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve fail to internalize and execute on that strategy we may fail to meet our customers’ expectations fail to compete with our competitors’ products and technology and lose the confidence of our channel partners and employees this in turn could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

from time to time we introduce new business and sales initiatives if we fail to successfully execute and manage these initiatives our results of operations could be negatively impacted 

as part of our effort to accommodate our customers’ needs and demands and the rapid evolution of technology we from time to time evolve our business and sales initiatives such as our expanding portfolio of suites we may take such actions without clear indications that they will prove successful market acceptance of any new business or sales initiative is dependent on our ability to match our customers’ needs at the right time and price often we have limited prior experience and operating history in these new areas of emphasis if any of our assumptions about expenses revenue or revenue recognition principles from these initiatives proves incorrect our actual results may vary materially from those anticipated and our financial results will be negatively impacted 

if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights our business could be harmed 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright and trademark laws trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software products or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our software products is timeconsuming and costly while we have recovered some revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists and we 

  

 expect that software piracy will remain a persistent problem furthermore our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 

additionally we actively protect the secrecy of our confidential information and trade secrets including our source code if unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code the loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for thirdparties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our financial performance and our reputation we also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of nondisclosure agreements with our customers contractors vendors and partners however it is possible that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization if this were to occur it may be difficult andor costly for us to enforce our rights and our financial performance and reputation could be negatively impacted 

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 

as more software patents are granted worldwide the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grow and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlap we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims infringement or misappropriation claims have in the past been and may in the future be asserted against us and any such assertions could harm our business additionally certain patent holders without products have become more aggressive in threatening and pursuing litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents any such claims or threats whether with or without merit have been and could in the future be timeconsuming to defend result in costly litigation and diversion of resources cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in addition such royalty or license agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms if at all which would likely harm our business 

if we do not maintain good relationships with the members of our distribution channel or achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected if our distribution channel suffers financial losses becomes financially unstable or insolvent or is not provided the right mix of incentives to sell our products our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected 

we sell our software products both directly to endusers and through a network of distributors and resellers for the fiscal year ended january 31 2011 approximately 85 of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the future our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller network computer software distributors and resellers typically are not highly capitalized have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and experienced difficulties during the past several years we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of distributors and resellers prior to our sales to them in the past we have taken steps to support them and may take additional steps in the future such as extending credit terms and providing temporary discounts these steps if taken could harm our financial results if our distributors and resellers were to become insolvent they would not be able to maintain their business and sales or provide customer support services which would negatively impact our business and revenue 

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including the distributor tech data corporation and its global affiliates “tech data” tech data accounted for 16 14 and 14 of our consolidated net revenue for the fiscal years ended january 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

over time we have modified and will continue to modify aspects of our relationship with our distributors and resellers such as their incentive programs pricing to them and our distribution model to motivate and reward 

  

them for aligning their businesses with our strategy and business objectives changes in these relationships and underlying programs could negatively impact their business and harm our business in addition the loss of or a significant reduction in business with those distributors or resellers or the failure to achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough with any one of our major international distributors or large resellers could harm our business in particular if one or more of such distributors or resellers were unable to meet their obligations with respect to accounts payable to us we could be forced to write off such accounts and may be required to delay the recognition of revenue on future sales to these customers these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we are subject to legal proceedings and regulatory inquiries and we may be named in additional legal proceedings or become involved in regulatory inquiries in the future all of which are costly distracting to our core business and could result in an unfavorable outcome or a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows or the trading price for our securities 

we are involved in legal proceedings and receive inquiries from regulatory agencies as the global economy has changed and our business has evolved we have seen an increase in litigation activity in addition like many other high technology companies the number and frequency of inquiries from us and foreign regulatory agencies we have received regarding our business and our business practices and the business practices of others in our industry have increased in recent years in the event that we are involved in significant disputes or are the subject of a formal action by a regulatory agency we could be exposed to costly and time consuming legal proceedings that could result in any number of outcomes while outcomes of such actions vary any claims or regulatory actions initiated by or against us whether successful or not could result in expensive costs of defense costly damage awards injunctive relief increased costs of business fines or orders to change certain business practices significant dedication of management time diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business in any of these cases our financial results could be negatively impacted 

a breach of security in our products or computer systems may compromise the integrity of our products harm our reputation create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results 

we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our product source code and computer systems there appears to be an increasing number of computer “hackers” developing and deploying a variety of destructive software programs such as viruses worms and the like that could attack our products and computer systems despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such programs it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk like all software products our software is vulnerable to such attacks the impact of such an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our software products cause errors in the output of our customers’ work allow unauthorized access to sensitive proprietary or confidential information of ours or our customers and other destructive outcomes if this were to occur our reputation may suffer customers may stop buying our products we could face lawsuits and potential liability and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to section 404 we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting the report contains among other matters an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 

  

 while we have determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 31 2010 as indicated in our management report on internal control over financial reporting included in this annual report on form 10k we must continue to monitor and assess our internal control over financial reporting if our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and such weakness remains uncorrected at fiscal year end we will be unable to assert such internal control is effective at fiscal year end if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective at fiscal yearend or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or concludes that we have a material weakness in our internal controls we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which would likely have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 

in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements which if not accurate may significantly impact our financial results 

we make assumptions judgments and estimates for a number of items including the fair value of financial instruments goodwill longlived assets and other intangible assets the realizability of deferred tax assets and the fair value of stock awards we also make assumptions judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee related liabilities including commissions bonuses and sabbaticals and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions partner incentive programs product returns reserves allowances for doubtful accounts asset retirement obligations and legal contingencies these assumptions judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from our estimates and such differences could significantly impact our financial results 

changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business further such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective 

for example the usbased financial accounting standards board “fasb” is currently working together with the international accounting standards board “iasb” on several projects to further align accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies who are required to follow us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” under sec regulations and those who are required to follow ifrs outside of the us these efforts by the fasb and iasb may result in different accounting principles under gaap that may result in materially different financial results for us in areas including but not limited to principles for recognizing revenue and lease accounting 

in addition the sec has stated that it intends to make a determination in 2011 regarding the incorporation of ifrs into the financial reporting system for us companies a change in accounting principles from gaap to ifrs may have a material impact on the way in which we report financial results 

it is not clear if or when these potential changes in accounting principles may become effective whether we have the proper systems and controls in place to accommodate such changes and the impact that any such changes may have on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows in addition as we evolve and change our business and sales models we are currently unable to take into account how these potential changes may impact our new models particularly in the area of revenue recognition 

  

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the us and we make certain business and resource decisions based on assumptions about foreign currency we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 

we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our earnings exposure and cash flow exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as part of our risk management strategy we use foreign currency contracts to manage a portion of our exposures of underlying assets liabilities and other obligations which exist as part of our ongoing business operations these foreign currency instruments have maturities that extend for 1 to 12 months in the future and provide us with some protection against currency exposures however our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our financial results 

the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period although our foreign currency cash flow hedge program extends beyond the current quarter in order to reduce our exposure to foreign currency volatility we do not attempt to completely mitigate this risk and in any case will incur transaction fees in adopting such hedging programs such volatility even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings 

our investment portfolio is composed of a variety of investment vehicles in a number of countries that are subject to interest rate trends market volatility and other economic factors if general economic conditions further cause interest rates to decline credit ratings of our investments to deteriorate or illiquidity in the financial marketplace we may continue to experience a decline in interest income an inability to sell our investments or impairment in the value of our investments 

it is our policy to invest our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in highly liquid instruments with and in the custody of financial institutions with high credit ratings and to limit the amounts invested with any one institution type of security and issuer however we are subject to general economic conditions interest rate trends and volatility in the financial marketplace that can affect the income that we receive from our investments the net realizable value of our investments including our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and our ability to sell them in the us for example the yields on our portfolio securities are very low due to general economic conditions any one of these factors could reduce our interest income or result in material charges which in turn could impact our overall net income and earnings per share 

if we were to experience a loss on any of our investments that loss may cause us to record an otherthantemporary impairment charge the effect of this charge could impact our overall net income and earnings per share in any of these scenarios our liquidity may be negatively impacted which in turn may prohibit us from making investments in our business taking advantage of opportunities and potentially meeting our financial obligations as they come due 

our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our success and ability to invest and grow depend largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical professional managerial sales and marketing personnel historically competition for these key personnel has been intense the loss of services of any of our key personnel including key personnel joining our company through acquisitions the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions and financial goals 

  

 our financial results could be negatively impacted if our tax positions are successfully challenged by tax authorities 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions our effective tax rate is based on our expected geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany transfer pricing and enacted tax rules significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis we believe our tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 

we rely on third party technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies our product and service development may be delayed and our financial results negatively impacted 

we rely on certain software that we license from third parties including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions these thirdparty software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and the software may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software can be developed identified licensed and integrated which would likely harm our business 

disruptions with licensing relationships and third party developers could adversely impact our business 

we license certain key technologies from third parties licenses may be restricted in the term or the use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business similarly we may not be able to obtain or renew license agreements for key technology on favorable terms if at all and any failure to do so could harm our business 

our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with thirdparty developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn in particular markets such disruptions have in the past and would likely in the future negatively impact these thirdparty developers and end users which could harm our business 

additionally technology created by outsourced product development whether outsourced to third parties or developed externally and transferred to us through business or technology acquisitions have certain additional risks such as effective integration into existing products adequate transfer of technology knowhow and ownership and protection of transferred intellectual property 

as a result of our strategy of partnering with other companies for product development our product delivery schedules could be adversely affected if we experience difficulties with our product development partners 

we partner with certain independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities we believe our partnering strategy allows us to among other things achieve efficiencies in developing new products and maintaining and enhancing existing product offerings our partnering strategy creates a dependency on such independent developers independent developers including those who currently develop products for us in the us and throughout the world may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future in addition use of development resources through consulting relationships particularly in nonus jurisdictions with developing legal systems may be adversely impacted by and expose us to risks relating to evolving employment export and intellectual property laws these risks could among other things expose our intellectual property to misappropriation and result in disruptions to product delivery schedules 

  

we rely on thirdparties to provide us with a number of operational services including hosting and delivery certain of our customer services operations as well as some of our operations any interruption or delay in service from these third parties breaches of security or privacy or failures in data collection could expose us to liability harm our reputation and adversely impact our financial performance 

we rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide our customers and computer operations for our internal use as we gather customer data and host certain customer data in thirdparty facilities a security breach could compromise the integrity or availability of customer data in addition our operations could be negatively affected in the event of a security breach and we could be subject to the loss or theft of confidential or proprietary information including source code unauthorized access to this data may be obtained through breakins breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party employee theft or misuse or other misconduct we rely on a number of third party suppliers in the operation of our business for the provision of various services and materials that we use in the operation of our business and production of our products although we seek to diversify our third party suppliers we may from time to time rely on a single or limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country for these services or materials the inability of such third parties to satisfy our requirements could disrupt our business operations or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy if any of these situations were to occur our reputation could be harmed we could be subject to third party liability including under data protection and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

we regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems disrupt our operations our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network and data center infrastructure internal technology systems and our websites for our development marketing operational support sales accounting and financial reporting activities we are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet the growing requirements of our business and customers such improvements are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or uncover problems with our existing technology systems unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in disruption in our business operations loss of revenue errors in our accounting and financial reporting or damage to our reputation 

our business may be significantly disrupted upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event 

our business is highly automated and relies extensively on the availability of our network and data center infrastructure our internal technology systems and our websites we also rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide to our customers and computer operations for our internal use the failure of our systems or hosted computer services due to a catastrophic event such as an earthquake fire flood weather event telecommunications failure power failure cyber attack or war could adversely impact our business financial results and financial condition we have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems in order to reduce the potential impact of a catastrophic event however there can be no assurance that these plans and systems would enable us to return to normal business operations

in addition to the competitive advantages afforded by our technology our large global network of distributors resellers thirdparty developers customers educational institutions faculty and students is a key competitive advantage this network of relationships provides us with a broad and deep reach into volume markets around the world our distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with the resources to purchase deploy learn and support our products quickly and easily we have a significant number of registered thirdparty developers who create products that work well with autodesk products and extend them for a variety of specialized applications users fluent in our products are broadly and globally available from educational institutions and in the existing workforce we offer extensive educational programs including student versions of software curricula and faculty development we have an extensive global community of students who are fluent in our software and poised to become the next generation of professional users – thus reducing the cost of training and providing fresh talent for our customers our global network of distributors resellers third party developers customers educational institutions and students has been developed over our twentyeight year history we believe it is an enduring competitive advantage that is difficult for others to replicate 

our growth strategy includes continually increasing the business value of our design tools to our customers in a number of ways first we seek to address an increasing portion of our customers’ workflow with products that extend the value of our customers’ digital design information into visualization analysis and simulation second we extend our customers’ workflow with products for adjacent users and for the “customers of our customers” thus increasing the value of the design information our customers produce third we seek to improve our product interoperability and usability thus improving our customers’ productivity and effectiveness fourth we develop new ways to deliver capability and value to our customers such as product suites softwareasaservice mobile devices and new hardware platforms notably in october 2010 we released autocad for the mac reaching a large base of native mac environment customers finally we have developed a new line of consumer products for the web ipad and mobile devices that provide our advanced visualization technologies to consumers—a whole new category of autodesk customer 

a number of our customers use our horizontal design products autocad and autocad lt we also develop a large number of vertical modelbased design products we believe that expanding our horizontal design product customers’ portfolios to include our vertical design products and our model based design products and now our suites presents a meaningful growth opportunity and is an important part of our overall strategy for fiscal 2011 revenue from modelbased design products increased 18 as compared to the prior fiscal year and as a percentage of revenue increased to 30 in fiscal 2011 as compared to 29 in fiscal 2010 for fiscal 2011 revenue from suites increased 26 as compared to the prior fiscal year and as a percentage of revenue increased to 23 in fiscal 2011 as compared to 20 in fiscal 2010 we believe that the adoption of vertical design products and modelbased design products by our customers in all industries will increase their productivity and the value of their design data 

expanding our geographic coverage is another key element of our growth strategy while emerging markets are important for all global businesses we believe they hold special opportunity for autodesk much of the growth in the world’s construction and manufacturing is happening in emerging markets further emerging markets face many of the challenges that our design technology can help address for example infrastructure buildout we believe that emerging economies continue to present longterm growth opportunities for us and revenue from emerging countries increased 17 during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 revenue from emerging countries represented 15 of both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 net revenue while we believe there are longterm growth opportunities in emerging economies conducting business in these countries presents significant challenges including economic volatility geopolitical risk local competition intellectual property protection poorly developed business infrastructure scarcity of talent and software piracy 

our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products technology and businesses acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers however they entail cost 

  

 and integration challenges and may in certain instances negatively impact our operating margins we continually review these tradeoffs in making decisions regarding acquisitions we currently anticipate that we will acquire products technology and businesses as compelling opportunities that promote our strategy become available the pace at which we make such investments will vary depending upon our business needs the availability of suitable sellers and technology and our own financial condition 

our strategy depends upon a number of assumptions including that we will be able to continue making our technology available to mainstream markets leverage our large global network of distributors resellers thirdparty developers customers educational institutions and students improve the performance and functionality of our products and adequately protect our intellectual property if the outcome of any of these assumptions differs from our expectations we may not be able to implement our strategy which could potentially adversely affect our business for further discussion regarding these and related risks see part i item 1a “risk factors” 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we regularly reevaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we believe that of all our significant accounting policies the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 

for multiple element arrangements that include software products we allocate the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on their vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value vsoe is the price charged when an element is sold separately or a price set by management with the relevant authority if we do not have vsoe of an undelivered software license we defer revenue recognition on the entire sales arrangement until all elements for which we do not have vsoe are delivered if we do not have vsoe for undelivered maintenance or services the revenue for the arrangement is recognized over the longest contractual period in the arrangement we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 

our assessment of likelihood of collection is also a critical factor in determining the timing of revenue recognition if we do not believe that collection is probable the revenue will be deferred until the earlier of when collection is deemed probable or payment is received 

our indirect channel model includes both a twotiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a onetiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers our product license revenue from distributors and resellers are generally recognized at the time title to our product passes to the distributor in a twotiered structure or reseller in a onetiered structure provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met this policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns among other criteria we are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or 

  

determinable payments regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers our policy also presumes that we have no significant performance obligations in connection with the sale of our product licenses by our distributors and resellers to their customers if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

marketable securities at january 31 2011 we had 3918 million of short and longterm marketable securities marketable securities are stated at fair value as described in note 3 “fair value measurements” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements we estimate the fair value of our marketable securities each quarter fair value is defined as an exit price representing the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when identical or similar assets are traded in active markets the level of judgment required to estimate their fair value is relatively low this is generally true for our cash and cash equivalents and the majority of our marketable securities which we consider to be level 1 assets and level 2 assets however determining the fair value of marketable securities when observable inputs are not available level 3 requires significant judgment for example we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of our auction rate securities because we have determined that the market for those securities is inactive this determination is based on the fact that due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets the regularly scheduled auctions for the auction rate securities we hold have generally failed since august 2007 these assumptions are inherently subjective and involve significant management judgment whenever possible we use observable market data and rely on unobservable inputs only when observable market data is not available when determining fair value 

business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to assets and liabilities as well as to inprocess research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date the purchase price allocation process requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations 

although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain examples of critical estimates used in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from sales maintenance agreements and acquired developed technologies the acquired company’s trade name and customer relationships as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and customer relationships will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio expected costs to develop the inprocess research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed and discount rates 

goodwill we test goodwill for impairment annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment when assessing goodwill for impairment we use discounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether goodwill is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge impairment charges if any result from instances where the fair values of net assets associated with goodwill are less than their carrying values as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

as of january 31 2011 a hypothetical 10 decrease in the fair value of our reporting units would not have an impact on the carrying value of goodwill nor result in impairment of goodwill for further discussion see note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

realizability of longlived assets we assess the realizability of our longlived assets and related intangible assets other than goodwill annually during the fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or 

  

 changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review significant underperformance of a business or product line relative to budget shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends and the results of past impairment reviews 

in assessing the recoverability of these longlived assets we first determine their fair values which are based on assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows that could reasonably be generated by these assets if impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows we would discount the cash flows to assess impairments on longlived assets variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge impairment charges if any result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values 

in addition to our recoverability assessments we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our longlived assets any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made as well as in subsequent quarters 

we will continue to evaluate the values of our longlived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

income taxes we currently have 1475 million of net deferred tax assets primarily a result of tax credits net operating losses and timing differences for reserves accrued liabilities stock options purchased technologies and capitalized intangibles partially offset by the establishment of us deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries deferred tax liabilities associated with tax method change on advanced payments and valuation allowances against california and canadian deferred tax assets we perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets and believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors any change in future profitability may require material adjustments to these net deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determination is made 

stockbased compensation  we measure stockbased compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award and recognize expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period we estimate the fair value of stockbased payment awards using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model the determination of the fair value of a stockbased award on the date of grant using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors the riskfree interest rate for the expected term of the award and expected dividends the variables used in the model are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted as needed the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

legal contingencies  as described in part i item 3 “legal proceedings” and part ii item 8 note 8 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations

overview of fiscal 2011 results of operations 

 

 our results for fiscal 2011 reflect recent improvements in global demand as compared to the prior fiscal year when the economic downturn had decreased demand for our products and services and customers reduced their workforces while some global macroeconomic indicators improved during fiscal 2011 unemployment remains high in several important geographies including the us additionally there are a number of mixed data points as to whether credit has become more readily available and it is unclear whether and how the availability of credit continues to impact our customers and partners 

our business grew year over year as evidenced by our increases in revenue gross profit and income from operations during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 net revenue increase 14 gross profit increased 15 and income from operations increased 314 contributing to the year over year increases in revenue were increases in revenue from new seat licenses maintenance revenue revenue for most of our major products all of our reportable segments and all of our geographies during fiscal 2011 as compared to the prior fiscal year in addition we continued to make progress in controlling our operating costs which led to year over year improvements in profitability the 314 increase in income from operations in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was due to the increase in our net revenue while holding the growth of operating expenses the majority of our costs are relatively fixed in the short term as they relate primarily to our workforce in fiscal 2011 we were able to grow our net revenue without significantly increasing our workforce we believe that the improvements in these areas are indications that our business stabilized and is beginning to grow 

our total operating margin increased from 656 million or 4 of revenue during fiscal 2010 to 2714 million or 14 of revenue during fiscal 2011 the increase in our operating margin during fiscal 2011 was primarily due to net revenue increasing more rapidly than the increase in our costs due to our cost saving initiatives during fiscal 2011 and 2010 net revenue increased 2381 million or 14 for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 while our operating expenses increased 275 million or 2 for fiscal 2011 the 2 increase in operating expenses in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was due to performance based compensation related to higher company performance the return of employee costs which were temporarily suppressed in the prior year such as salary reductions employee incentives and mandatory vacation and other costs associated with higher revenue these increases were partially offset by the decrease in restructuring charges of 374 million the decrease in goodwill impairment charges of 210 million and the decrease in stockbased compensation charges of 127 million 

we believe net revenue for fiscal 2012 will increase by approximately 10 compared to fiscal 2011 we anticipate fiscal 2012 operating margin will increase by approximately 220 basis points compared to fiscal 2011 net revenue from japan was 2006 million or approximately 10 of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended january 31 2011 the earthquake and tsunami that struck japan in march 2011 has created uncertainty which may impact our future financial results 

  

 we generate a significant amount of our revenue in the us japan germany france the united kingdom canada italy south korea australia and belgium included in the overall increase in revenue were impacts associated with foreign currency our revenue benefited from foreign exchange rate changes during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 had applicable exchange rates from fiscal 2010 been in effect during fiscal 2011 and had we excluded foreign exchange hedge gains and losses from fiscal 2011 “on a constant currency basis” net revenue would have increased 13 compared to the prior fiscal year operating expenses during fiscal year 2011 increased 2 compared to the prior fiscal year as reported and increased 3 on a constant currency basis changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue operating expenses and income from operations in future periods we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on a portion of the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions but do not attempt to completely mitigate the impact of fluctuation of such foreign currency against the us dollar 

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including tech data corporation and its global affiliates collectively “tech data” tech data accounted for 16 and 14 of our consolidated net revenue during fiscal year 2011 and 2010 respectively we believe our business is not substantially dependent on tech data our actual customers through tech data are the resellers and end users who purchase our software licenses and services should any of the agreements between us and tech data be terminated for any reason we believe that arrangements could be made so that the resellers and end users who currently purchase our products through tech data would be able to continue to do so under substantially the same terms from one of our many other distributors without substantial disruption to us 

our primary goals for fiscal 2012 are to grow revenue and improve operating margin percentage by delivering our marketleading products and solutions to our customers and investing in product functionality and new product lines including suites offerings however there can be no assurance that we will achieve our financial goals and improve our financial results 

at january 31 2011 we had 14669 million in cash and marketable securities we completed fiscal 2011 with a higher deferred revenue balance and a higher accounts receivable balance as compared to fiscal 2010 our deferred revenue balance at january 31 2011 included 5095 million of customer maintenance contracts which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the life of the contracts which is predominantly one year but may be two or three year or occasionally as long as five year terms we repurchased 90 million shares of our common stock for 2803 million during fiscal 2011 comparatively we repurchased 27 million shares of our common stock for 632 million during fiscal 2010 

  

results of operations 

net revenue 

 

 fiscal 2011 net revenue compared to fiscal 2010 net revenue 

license and other revenue 

license and other revenue is comprised of two components all forms of product license revenue and other revenue product license revenue includes revenue from the sale of new seat licenses upgrades and crossgrades other revenue consists of revenue from creative finishing consulting and training services collaborative project management services and our former location services division we divested the location services division in february 2009 

total license and other revenue increased 20 during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 license and other revenue from horizontal design and vertical design products increased 18 and license and other revenue from modelbased design products increased 18 each as compared to the prior fiscal year these increases were primarily due to the 31 increase in commercial new seat revenue during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 during fiscal 2011 28 percentage points of the 31 increase was due to the increase in the number of seats sold and 3 percentage points was due to higher average net revenue per seat commercial new seat revenue as a percentage of license and other revenue was 67 and 61 for fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively 

also contributing to the increase in license and other revenue during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was the 22 increase in upgrade revenue which includes crossgrade revenue upgrade revenue was higher during fiscal 2011 primarily due to a onetime increase in upgrades in response to a promotion in advance of the march 2010 increase in upgrade pricing an additional promotion run in the americas geography in the fourth quarter and an increase in the number of larger revenue transactions in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 

  

 revenue from the sales of our services training and support included in “license and other revenue” represented less than 4 of net revenue for all periods presented 

maintenance revenue 

our maintenance revenue relates to a program known by our user community as the subscription program our maintenance program provides our commercial and educational customers with a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of our new releases and enhancements when and if released during the term of their contracts under our maintenance program customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades when and if available downloadable training courses and online support we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the maintenance contract periods 

maintenance revenue increased 6 during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to a 7 increase in commercial maintenance revenue total subscription program enrollment at january 31 2011 and 2010 consisted of about 29 million users and 22 million users respectively 

the 7 increase in commercial maintenance revenue was due to a 5 percentage point increase in net revenue per maintenance seat and a 2 percentage point increase in commercial enrollment during the corresponding maintenance contract term commercial maintenance revenue represented 98 of maintenance revenue for both fiscal 2011 and 2010 

changes in maintenance revenue lag changes in net billings for maintenance contracts because we recognize the revenue from those contracts ratably over their contract terms which are predominantly one year but may be two or three year or occasionally as long as five year terms net maintenance billings increased 14 during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 this increase was due to an increase in renewals more new seats sold and the impact from the upgrade pricing promotion mentioned above 

aggregate backlog at january 31 2011 and january 31 2010 was 6154 million and 5425 million respectively of which 5879 million and 5165 million respectively represented deferred revenue backlog related to current software license product orders that had not shipped at the end of the quarter increased by 15 million during fiscal 2011 from 260 million at january 31 2010 to 275 million at january 31 2011 deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred maintenance revenue to a lesser extent deferred revenue consists of deferred license and other revenue derived from collaborative project management services consulting services and deferred license sales backlog from current software license product orders that we have not yet shipped consists of orders for currently available licensed software products from customers with approved credit status and may include orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period 

net revenue by geographic area 

net revenue in the americas geography increased by 7 both as reported and on a constant currency basis during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 this increase was primarily due to a 33 increase in revenue from new seats in the americas during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 maintenance revenue increased 3 during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 the americas was affected by slower economic growth than our other geographies which impacted growth rates for all of our products during fiscal 2011 

net revenue in the emea geography increased by 17 or 18 on a constant currency basis during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 the increase was primarily due to a 24 increase in new seat revenue and a 9 increase in maintenance revenue the emea geography’s increase in revenue during fiscal 2011 was primarily due to economic expansion in virtually all countries in that geography the increase in our revenue in that geography was led by germany france the united kingdom and belgium 

net revenue in the apac geography increased by 20 or 17 on a constant currency basis during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to a 24 increase in new seat revenue and a 48 increase in 

  

upgrade revenue net revenue expansion in the apac geography during fiscal 2011 occurred in virtually all countries led by japan and followed by south korea australia and india 

net revenue in emerging economies increased 17 during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to revenue from china the russian federation india brazil and poland this growth was a significant factor in our international sales growth during fiscal 2011 revenue from emerging economies represented 15 of net revenue for both fiscal 2011 and 2010 

we believe that international revenue will continue to comprise a majority of our total net revenue the economic conditions in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue may have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies have significantly affected and could continue to significantly affect our financial results for a given period even though we hedge a portion of our current and projected revenue international net revenue represented 71 of our net revenue in fiscal 2011 and 69 of our net revenue in fiscal 2010 we remain cautious regarding our financial prospects primarily due the uncertainty surrounding the sustainability of the global economic recovery 

net revenue by operating segment 

we have four reportable segments platform solutions and emerging business “pseb” architecture engineering and construction “aec” manufacturing “mfg” and media and entertainment “me” location services which we disposed of in february 2009 is not included in any of the above reportable segments and is reflected as other we have no material intersegment revenue 

net revenue for pseb increased 15 during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to a 20 increase in revenue from both our autocad and autocad lt products offset by a net 21 decrease in revenue from all other pseb products and services 

net revenue for aec increased 11 during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to a 24 increase in revenue from our revit products a 6 increase in revenue from our autocad civil 3d products and a 27 increase in revenue from our navisworks products 

net revenue for mfg increased 22 during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to a 23 increase in revenue from our autodesk inventor products and a 28 increase in our autocad mechanical products 

net revenue for me increased 5 during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to a 5 increase in revenue from our animation product group and a 3 increase in revenue from creative finishing the increase in animation revenue was primarily due to a 4 increase in revenue from autodesk 3ds max 

fiscal 2010 net revenue compared to fiscal 2009 net revenue 

license and other revenue 

total license and other revenue decreased 39 during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 license and other revenue from horizontal design and vertical design products decreased 33 and license and other revenue from modelbased design products decreased 19 each as compared to the prior fiscal year these decreases were primarily due to the 44 decrease in commercial new seat revenue during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 during fiscal 2010 29 percentage points of the 44 decrease was due to decreases in the number of seats sold and 15 percentage points was due to lower average net revenue per seat commercial new seat revenue as a percentage of license and other revenue was 61 and 67 for fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively 

also contributing to the decrease in license and other revenue during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was the 32 decrease in upgrade revenue which includes crossgrade revenue the decrease in upgrade revenue 

  

 was driven primarily by the global economic contraction additionally upgrade revenue was lower during fiscal 2010 because of the relatively smaller size of the upgradeable base of our autocadbased products as compared to the upgradeable base of our autocadbased products during fiscal 2009 due to a higher percentage of customers on our maintenance program which includes unspecified upgrades when and if available 

maintenance revenue 

maintenance revenue increased 3 during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to a 3 increase in commercial maintenance revenue the increase in commercial maintenance revenue was due to 8 percentage points from higher net revenue per maintenance seat partially offset by 5 percentage points from lower program enrollment due to the economic downturn our 3 increase in maintenance revenue in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 reflects an 18 increase in maintenance billings in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 partially offset by a 7 decline in maintenance billings in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 the number of users increased from 17 million at january 31 2009 to 22 million at january 31 2010 primarily due to a onetime adjustment of 06 million educational seats for users who were migrated to a standard educational maintenance plan during the second fiscal quarter ended july 31 2009 these users were not previously captured in our maintenance installed base prior to the second quarter of fiscal 2010 

maintenance billings declined 7 in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 this decrease was due to fewer new seats sold and a decrease in renewal rates as customers reduced their work force the year over year growth in billings for maintenance contracts began to slow in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 although maintenance billings increased slightly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 the yearoveryear decrease in maintenance billings caused downward pressure on maintenance revenue during subsequent years 

net revenue by geographic area 

net revenue in the americas geography decreased by 16 both as reported and on a constant currency basis during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 this decrease was primarily due to a 27 decrease in revenue from new seats partially offset by a 5 increase in upgrade revenue in the americas during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 maintenance revenue growth was flat in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 growth in the americas was affected by economic volatility that impacted growth rates for all of our products during fiscal 2010 

net revenue in the emea geography decreased by 33 or 26 on a constant currency basis during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 the decrease was primarily due to a 50 decrease in new seat revenue and a 49 decrease in revenue from upgrades these decreases were partially offset by a 2 increase in maintenance revenue in emea during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 the emea geography’s decline in revenue during fiscal 2010 was primarily due to economic contraction in virtually all countries in that geography the decrease in our revenue in that geography was led by emerging economy countries followed by germany france italy and the united kingdom the negative effect of the stronger value of the us dollar relative to the euro the british pound and other european currencies also contributed to the decrease in net revenue in emea 

net revenue in the apac geography decreased by 27 or 28 on a constant currency basis during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to a 38 decrease in new seat revenue and a 42 decrease in upgrade revenue these decreases were partially offset by a 13 increase in maintenance revenue net revenue contraction in the apac geography during fiscal 2010 occurred in virtually all countries led by japan and followed by china south korea india and australia 

revenue from emerging economies decreased 37 during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 revenue from emerging economies represented 15 and 18 of net revenue during fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively this decrease contributed to our international sales contraction during fiscal 2010 

  

international net revenue represented 69 of our net revenue in fiscal 2010 and 72 of our net revenue in fiscal 2009 we started to experience some economic difficulty in international sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 global conditions worsened and the economic downturn significantly impacted our international sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 particularly the robust business we had been seeing in emerging economies the economic contractions in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue had an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance in fiscal 2010 

net revenue by operating segment 

net revenue for pseb decreased 31 during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to a 38 decrease in revenue from our autocad lt products and a 31 decrease in revenue from our autocad products offset by a net 12 increase in revenue from all other pseb products and services 

net revenue for aec decreased 20 during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to a 24 decrease in revenue from our revit products a 32 decrease in revenue from our autocad architecture products a 15 decrease in revenue from our autocad civil 3d products and a net 13 decrease in revenue from all other aec products and services 

net revenue for mfg decreased 21 during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to a 25 decrease in revenue from our autodesk inventor products and a 34 decrease in revenue from our autodesk mechanical products offset by a net 2 increase in revenue from all other mfg products and services 

net revenue for me decreased 28 during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to a 42 decrease in revenue from creative finishing and an 18 decrease in revenue from our animation product group the decrease in animation revenue was primarily due to a 33 decrease in revenue from autodesk 3ds max and a 17 decrease in revenue from maya offset by a net 32 increase in revenue from all other me products and services 

cost of revenue and operating expenses 

cost of revenue 

 

 cost of license and other revenue includes labor costs of order fulfillment and costs of fulfilling consulting and training services contracts and collaborative project management services contracts cost of license and other revenue also includes stockbased compensation expense direct material and overhead charges amortization of purchased technology professional services fees and royalties direct material and overhead charges include the cost of hardware sold mainly pcbased workstations for creative finishing in the me segment costs associated with transferring our software to electronic media printing of user manuals and packaging materials and shipping and handling costs 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2011 autodesk reclassified certain costs of revenue which primarily included reclassifying certain shipping and fulfillment expenses from “cost of license and other revenue” to 

  

 “cost of maintenance revenue” due to a change in our cost allocation methodology these expenses have been updated in the consolidated statements of operations which include reclassifying 79 million and 65 million from cost of license to cost of maintenance revenue for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 respectively see note 1 “basis of presentation” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

cost of license and other revenue decreased 6 during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to savings on shipping and handling costs caused by the switch to a lower cost vendor as well as an increase in electronic order fulfillment cost of license and other revenue decreased 16 during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to the 39 decrease in license and other revenue cost of license and other revenue did not decline as rapidly as the associated net revenue in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 because of increased amortization of purchased technology related to fiscal years 2010 and 2009 acquisitions costs associated with redundant services as we migrated a portion of our it systems onto a new platform and higher costs associated with the implementation of our electronic fulfillment system 

cost of maintenance revenue includes labor costs of providing product support to our maintenance customers including stockbased compensation expense for these employees rent and occupancy shipping and handling costs and professional services fees cost of maintenance revenue increased 74 during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due to an increase in maintenance support headcount these increases were partially offset by savings on freight and materials costs as fewer maintenance customers require physical shipments than in the past due to electronic fulfillment cost of maintenance revenue increased 29 during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 due to an increase in product support headcount due to the acquisition of moldflow corporation in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 

cost of revenue at least over the near term is affected by the volume and mix of product sales mix of physical versus electronic fulfillment fluctuations in consulting costs amortization of purchased technology new customer support offerings royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products and employee stockbased compensation expense we expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars but to remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 

marketing and sales 

 

 marketing and sales expenses include salaries bonuses benefits and stockbased compensation expense for our marketing and sales employees and the expense of travel entertainment and training for such personnel and the costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue such as advertising trade shows and expositions and various sales and promotional programs marketing and sales expenses also include labor costs of sales and order processing sales and dealer commissions rent and occupancy and the cost of supplies and equipment marketing and sales expenses increased 6 during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to higher employeerelated costs related to variable compensation including commissions bonuses and related fringe benefits variable compensation expenses increased as a result of exceeding our fiscal 2011 target revenue growth and operating margin growth targets more than we did in fiscal 2010 our annual incentive plans are based on forecasted revenue and operating margin with current year targets set at the beginning of fiscal 2011 these increases were partially offset by the decrease in advertising and promotion spending and stockbased compensation expense marketing and sales expenses decreased 19 during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to lower employeerelated costs driven by decreased marketing and sales headcount and decreased travel expenditures and reduced advertising and promotional expenses 

  

we expect to balance our need to invest in the marketing and sales of our products with our desire to actively manage our sales and marketing operating expenses as a result we expect marketing and sales expense to increase in absolute dollars but to slightly decrease as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 

research and development 

 

 research and development expenses which are expensed as incurred consist primarily of salaries bonuses benefits and stockbased compensation expense for research and development employees and the expense of travel entertainment and training for such personnel rent and occupancy professional services such as fees paid to software development firms and independent contractors research and development expenses increased 8 during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to an increase in bonuses salaries and benefits research and development expenses decreased 21 during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to decreases in employeerelated costs driven by decreased research and development headcount also contributing to the decline was a decrease in acquisition related inprocess research and development charges from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 we expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as we continue to invest in product development and acquire new technology in fiscal 2012 

general and administrative 

 

 general and administrative expenses include salaries bonuses benefits and stockbased compensation expense for our finance human resources and legal employees and the expense of travel entertainment and training for such personnel as well as professional fees for legal and accounting services amortization of acquisition related customer relationships and trade names expense of communication and the cost of supplies and equipment general and administrative expenses increased 2 from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 primarily due to an increase in bonuses and salaries partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense general and administrative expenses decreased 4 from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 primarily due to decreases in employeerelated costs driven by decreased general and administrative headcount and reduced rent and occupancy costs due to the consolidation of facilities this decrease was partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization related to capital expenditures from fiscal 2009 and 2010 we expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars but remain consistent as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 

  

 restructuring 

 

 in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 we initiated a restructuring plan in order to reduce operating costs the restructuring plan resulted in targeted staff reductions of approximately 200 positions no leased facilities were consolidated as part of this restructuring in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 we initiated a restructuring program which resulted in headcount reduction of approximately 430 positions globally and resulted in the consolidation of approximately 32 leased facilities around the world in order to reduce our operating expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we initiated a restructuring program in order to reduce our operating costs this program reduced the number of employees by a total of approximately 700 positions globally and resulted in the consolidation of approximately 27 leased facilities in connection with these restructuring programs we recorded restructuring related charges of 108 million 482 million and 402 million during fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively of these amounts 108 million 243 million and 367 million were recorded for onetime termination benefits and other costs during fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively and 239 million and 35 million were recorded for facilitiesrelated costs during fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively the onetime termination benefits for these three restructuring programs have been substantially paid as of january 31 2011 we expect to pay the facilityrelated liabilities through fiscal 2018 see note 16 “restructuring reserve” in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

impairment of goodwill and intangibles 

 

 we did not record an impairment charge during fiscal 2011 during fiscal 2010 we recorded an impairment charge of 210 million representing the entire goodwill balance of our me segment as of april 30 2009 this goodwill balance related to our me segment’s fourth quarter fiscal 2009 acquisition of substantially all of the assets of softimage during fiscal 2009 we recorded a 1289 million impairment charge affecting the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 primarily related to impairment of goodwill associated with our me segment 

should our revenue and cash flow projections decline significantly in the future additional impairment charges may be recorded to goodwill as of january 31 2011 a hypothetical 10 decrease in the fair value of our reporting units would not have an impact on the carrying value of goodwill nor result in impairment of goodwill see note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

interest and other income net 

the following table sets forth the components of interest and other income net 

 

 interest and other income net decreased 185 million during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to foreign currency losses the loss on foreign currency in fiscal 2011 is primarily due to the impact of remeasuring foreign currency transactions into the functional currency of the corresponding entity partially offset by the gain on foreign currency derivatives not designated as hedging instruments 

interest and investment income net fluctuates based on average cash and marketable securities balances average maturities and interest rates the increase in interest and investment income net during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 is primarily due to the increase in interest income concurrent with the increase in our cash and marketable securities balance 

the increase in interest and other income net during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 is primarily due to gains on marketable securities gains on foreign currency transactions a gain on the sale of an investment and the impairment of an investment during fiscal 2009 these increases were partially offset by lower interest rate yields on investments during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 

provision for income taxes 

we account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse 

our effective tax rate was 22 and 32 during fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively our effective tax rate decreased 10 percentage points from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 primarily due to a change in expected future tax rates the establishment of the california valuation allowance in fiscal 2010 and a decrease in nondeductible stockbased compensation expense offset by a decrease in tax benefits from foreign earnings taxed at different rates in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 the state of california enacted legislation significantly altering california tax law as a result of the newly enacted legislation we expect that in fiscal years 2012 and beyond income subject to tax in california will be less than under prior tax law and accordingly deferred tax assets are less likely to be realized 

our effective tax rate was 32 and 27 during fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively our effective tax rate increased 5 percentage points from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 primarily due to a change in expected future tax rates and the establishment of the california valuation allowance in fiscal 2010 offset by nondeductible goodwill impairment and inprocess research and development expenses in fiscal 2009 

our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate research credits state income taxes the tax impact of stockbased compensation accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations us manufacturer’s deduction closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits changes in valuation allowances and changes in tax law 

  

 at january 31 2011 we had net deferred tax assets of 1475 million we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize these assets 

for additional information regarding our income tax provision see note 5 “income taxes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

other financial information 

in addition to our results determined under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” discussed above we believe the following nongaap measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the fiscal years ended january 31 2011 2010 and 2009 our gross profit gross margin income from operations operating margin net income and diluted earnings per share on a gaap and nongaap basis were as follows in millions except for gross margin operating margin and per share data 

 

 for our internal budgeting and resource allocation process we use nongaap measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis these nongaap measures do not include certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results we use nongaap measures in making operating decisions because we believe those measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our earning potential in addition these nongaap financial measures facilitate comparisons to our and our competitors’ historical results and operating guidance we also use these measures for purposes of determining companywide incentive compensation 

there are limitations in using nongaap financial measures because nongaap financial measures are not prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies the nongaap financial measures included above are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results in addition they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the nongaap financial measures we compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on a gaap basis as well as a nongaap basis and also by providing gaap measures in our public disclosures the presentation of nongaap financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap the nongaap financial measures are meant to supplement and be viewed in conjunction with gaap financial measures we urge investors to review the reconciliation of our nongaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures included below and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 

  

reconciliation of gaap financial measures to nongaap financial measures 

in millions except for gross margin operating margin and per share data 

 

  

   

 our nongaap financial measures as set forth in the table above exclude the following 

stockbased compensation expenses  we exclude stockbased compensation expenses from nongaap measures primarily because they are noncash expenses and management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

amortization of purchased intangibles and inprocess research and development expenses  we incur amortization of acquisitionrelated purchased intangible assets and charges related to inprocess research and development primarily in connection with acquisitions of certain businesses and technologies the amortization of purchased intangibles varies depending on the level of acquisition activity and management finds it useful to exclude these variable charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

goodwill impairment  this is a noncash charge to writedown goodwill to fair value when there was an indication that the asset was impaired as explained above management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various operating expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

restructuring charges  these expenses are associated with realigning our business strategies based on current economic conditions in connection with these restructuring actions we recognize costs related to termination benefits for former employees whose positions were eliminated and the closure of facilities and cancelation of certain contracts we exclude these charges because these expenses are not reflective of ongoing financial results in the current period 

establishment of a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets  this is a noncash charge to record a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets as explained above management finds it useful to exclude certain noncash charges to assess the appropriate level of various expenses to assist in budgeting planning and forecasting future periods 

discrete tax items  we exclude the gaap tax provision including discrete items from the nongaap measure of income and include a nongaap tax provision based upon the projected annual nongaap effective tax rate management believes this approach assists investors in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations 

income tax effects on the difference between gaap and nongaap costs and expenses  the income tax effects that are excluded from the nongaap measures relate to the tax impact on the difference between gaap and nongaap costs and expenses primarily due to differences in the timing of when income tax benefits are recognized for stock compensation and purchased intangibles for gaap and nongaap measures 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of cash is from the sale of licenses to our products our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employeerelated expenses such as compensation and benefits as well as general operating expenses for marketing facilities and overhead costs in addition to operating expenses we also use cash to invest in our growth initiatives which include acquisitions of products technology and businesses and to fund our stock repurchase program see further discussion of these items below 

at january 31 2011 our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 14669 million and net accounts receivable of 3184 million in addition we have a us line of credit facility that permits unsecured shortterm borrowings of up to 2500 million this line of credit agreement contains customary covenants that could restrict the imposition of liens on our assets and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or make dispositions of assets if we fail to maintain the financial covenants this 

  

credit facility is available for working capital and other business needs the us line of credit expires in august 2012 in addition to the us line of credit we had a 50 million china line of credit that was terminated during the second quarter of fiscal 2011 during fiscal 2011 we had no borrowings or repayments on either of our line of credit facilities at the beginning of fiscal 2010 we had 521 million outstanding on our us and china line of credit facilities during fiscal 2010 we borrowed 22 million under our credit facilities for a total outstanding balance of 543 million all of which we repaid in fiscal 2010 as of january 31 2011 and 2010 there were no borrowings outstanding under the us and china line of credit facilities 

our cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally our primary commercial banking relationship is with citibank and its global affiliates “citibank” in addition citicorp usa inc an affiliate of citibank is the lead lender and agent in the syndicate of our 2500 million us line of credit 

the increase in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities from 11262 million at january 31 2010 to 14669 million at january 31 2011 is principally the result of cash generated from operations and the proceeds from the issuance of common stock following stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases these increases to cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were partially offset by cash used for repurchases of our common stock capital expenditures and cash used for business combinations and other investing activities cash generated from operations was positively impacted by higher net revenue 

the primary source for net cash provided by operating activities of 5408 million for fiscal 2011 was net income of 2120 million increased by the effect of noncash expenses totaling 1861 million associated with depreciation and amortization and stockbased compensation in addition net cash flow provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities was 1319 million the primary source of working capital was an increase in deferred revenue due to higher maintenance billings for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 the primary working capital uses of cash were increases in accounts receivable due to higher billings in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 and an increase in prepaid and other assets 

at january 31 2011 our shortterm investment portfolio had an estimated fair value of 1992 million and a cost basis of 1975 million the portfolio fair value consisted of 477 million invested in commercial paper and corporate securities 472 million invested in us government agency securities 313 million invested in mutual funds 290 million invested in certificates of deposit and time deposits with remaining maturities at the date of purchase greater than 90 days and less than one year 260 million invested in us treasury securities 91 million invested in sovereign debt 86 million invested in municipal securities and 03 million invested in other shortterm securities 

at january 31 2010 autodesk was invested in the reserve international liquidity fund the “international fund” with an estimated fair value of 100 million in midseptember of 2008 the international fund ceased redemptions after net asset values of the funds decreased below 1 per share this occurred as a result of the international fund revaluing their holdings of debt securities issued by lehman brothers holdings inc “lehman brothers” which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on september 15 2008 and the resulting unusually high redemption requests on the international fund a third party court supervisor was appointed to oversee the accounting and payment administration of the international fund on november 30 2010 a judge entered an order accepting a settlement agreement directing the distribution of the remaining funds on january 20 2011 we received substantially all of our holdings from the international fund 

at january 31 2011 313 million of trading securities were invested in a defined set of mutual funds as directed by the participants in our deferred compensation plan see note 6 “deferred compensation” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

longterm cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following stock repurchases the acquisition of businesses software products or technologies complementary to 

  

 our business capital expenditures including the purchase and implementation of internaluse software applications and funding restructuring costs 

our cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances are concentrated in a few locations around the world with a substantial amount held outside of the us we believe that such dispersion is appropriate and meets our business and liquidity needs a portion of this cash cash equivalents and marketable securities could be subject to certain taxes including us income taxes in the event we believe repatriation to the us is appropriate 

our existing cash cash equivalents and investment balances may decline in fiscal 2012 in the event of a weakening of the global economy or changes in our planned cash outlay cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the risks detailed in part i item 1a titled “risk factors” however based on our current business plan and revenue prospects we believe that our existing balances our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next 12 months our existing us credit facility is currently 2500 million of which we have no amounts outstanding this credit facility is available for working capital and other business needs 

our revenue earnings cash flows receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency volatility that exists as part of our ongoing business operations we utilize cash flow hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions in addition we use balance sheet hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables and payables as of january 31 2011 and 2010 we had open cash flow and balance sheet hedge contracts with future settlements within one to twelve months contracts were primarily denominated in euros japanese yen swiss francs british pounds and canadian dollars we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes the notional amount of our option and forward contracts was 4016 million and 2587 million at january 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at january 31 2011 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 

 

  

    

operating lease obligations consist primarily of obligations for facilities net of sublease income computer equipment and other equipment leases 

purchase obligations are contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on autodesk and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligations relate primarily to hosting services agreements it infrastructure costs marketing costs and contractual software development services 

deferred compensation obligations relate to amounts held in a rabbi trust under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan see note 6 “deferred compensation” in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this plan 

pension obligations relate to our obligations for pension plans outside of the us see note 15 “retirement benefit plans” in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these obligations 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months in addition we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products royalty expense is generally based on the number of units shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue royalty expense included in cost of license and other revenue was 128 million in fiscal 2011 165 million in fiscal 2010 and 171 million in fiscal 2009 

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees including limited product warranties historically costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant but because potential future costs are highly variable we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations 

issuer purchases of equity securities 

our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the cumulative repurchase of up to 1840 million shares the purpose of the stock repurchase program is largely to help offset the dilution to net income per share caused by the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and for such other purposes as may be in the interests of autodesk and its stockholders and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders the number of shares acquired and the timing of the purchases are based on several factors including general market conditions the volume of employee stock option exercises the trading price of our common stock cash on hand and available in the us and company defined trading windows there were 20 million repurchases of our common stock during the three months ended january 31 2011 during the year ended january 31 2011 we repurchased 90 million shares of our common stock at january 31 2011 245 million shares remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization this program does not have a fixed expiration date see note 9 “stockholder’ equity” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than operating leases we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing arrangements or have any variableinterest entities as of january 31 2011 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend foreign currency exchange risk 

our revenue earnings cash flows receivables and payables are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency volatility that exists as part of our ongoing business operations we utilize cash flow hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on a portion of the net revenue or operating expense of certain anticipated transactions in addition we use balance sheet hedge contracts to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with foreign currency denominated receivables and payables as of january 31 2011 and 2010 we had open cash flow and balance sheet hedge contracts with future settlements within one to twelve months contracts were primarily denominated in euros japanese yen swiss francs british pounds and canadian dollars we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes the notional amount of our option and forward contracts was 4016 million and 2587 million at january 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

we utilize foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue and operating expenses of certain anticipated transactions a sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january 31 2011 indicated that a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 31 2011 and 2010 would increase the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by 316 million and 242 million respectively a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the dollar from its value at january 31 2011 and 2010 would decrease the fair value of our foreign currency contracts by 266 million and 131 million respectively 

interest rate risk 

interest rate movements affect both the interest income we earn on our short term investments and to a lesser extent the market value of certain longer term securities at january 31 2011 we had 14669 million of cash equivalents and marketable securities with an average cash equivalent investment balance for the quarter of approximately 8100 million if interest rates were to increase decrease by 10 this would result in a 02 million increase decrease in annual interest income further at january 31 2011 we had approximately 2850 million invested in a longer term portfolio with remaining maturities that may be less than one year which with 50 and 100 basis point moves would result in market value changes gains or losses of 09 million and 18 million respectively over a twelve month period at january 31 2010 we had 9100 million of cash equivalents and marketable securities with an average investment balance for the quarter of approximately 7428 million if interest rates were to increase decrease by 10 this would result in a 01 million increase decrease in annual interest income further at january 31 2010 we had approximately 1256 million invested in a longer term portfolio which with 50 and 100 basis point moves would result in market value changes gains or losses of 02 million over both six and 12 month periods we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as such term is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended during the quarter ended january 31 2011 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2011 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal control—integrated framework  our management has concluded that as of january 31 2011 our internal control over financial reporting is effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in item 8 herein

product development and introduction 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware operating systems and software in addition our customer’s requirements and preferences rapidly evolve as do their expectations of our software to keep pace with these changes we maintain a vigorous program of new product development to address demands in the marketplace for our products we dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to further enhance our existing products and to create new products and technologies research and development expenditures were 4575 million or 27 of fiscal 2010 net revenue 5761 million or 25 of fiscal 2009 net revenue and 4905 million or 23 of fiscal 2008 net revenue our software is primarily developed internally however we also use independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities additionally we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing or licensing products and technology from third parties we continually review these investments in an effort to ensure that we are generating sufficient revenue or gaining a competitive advantage to justify their costs 

the majority of our basic research and product development is performed in the united states china singapore and canada however we employ experienced software developers in all of our locations translation and localization of our products is performed in a number of local markets principally singapore and switzerland we generally localize and translate our products into german french italian spanish russian japanese korean and simplified and traditional chinese 

we plan to continue to manage significant product development operations internationally over the next several years we believe that our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize product development lower costs and integrate local market knowledge into our development activities we continually assess the significant costs and challenges including intellectual property protection against the benefits of our international development activities 

in addition our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with a network of over 3400 thirdparty developers who develop and sell their own products that further enhance the range of integrated solutions available to our customers 

for further discussion regarding risks from our product development and introduction efforts see item 1a “risk factors” 

  

 marketing and sales 

we license or sell our products and services globally primarily through indirect channels consisting of distributors and resellers to a lesser extent we also transact directly with customers who are primarily large corporations our indirect channel model includes both a twotiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a onetiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers we have a network of approximately 1900 resellers and distributors worldwide for fiscal 2010 approximately 83 of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the future we employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our reseller channel with our business strategies sales through one distributor tech data corporation and its affiliates accounted for 14 of our net revenue for each of the fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 no other distributor or reseller accounted for 10 or more of our revenue 

our customerrelated operations are divided into three geographic regions the americas europe middle east and africa “emea” and asia pacific “apac” each geographic region is supported by global marketing and sales organizations these organizations develop and manage overall marketing and sales programs and work closely with a network of domestic and international sales offices fiscal 2010 net revenue in the americas emea and apac was 6544 million 6711 million and 3882 million respectively we intend to continue to make our products available in foreign languages we believe that international sales will continue to comprise the majority of our net revenue economic weakness in countries where we generate a significant portion of our net revenue including the us has had and could in the future have an adverse effect on our business a summary of our financial information by geographic location is found in note 13 “segments” in the notes to consolidated financial statements our international operations and sales subject us to a variety of risks see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

we also work directly with reseller and distributor sales organizations computer manufacturers other software developers and peripherals manufacturers in cooperative advertising promotions and tradeshow presentations we employ massmarketing techniques such as web casts seminars telemarketing direct mailings and advertising in business and trade journals we have a worldwide user group organization and we have created online user communities dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products 

in addition to sales of new software licenses we generate revenue through our maintenance program and upgrade pricing options these choices are available for a majority of our products and offer our customers two alternative means of migrating to the most recent version of our products 

under the maintenance program known by our user community as the autodesk subscription program customers who own a perpetual use license for the most recent version of the underlying product are able to purchase maintenance that provides them with unspecified upgrades whenandifavailable and are able to download elearning courses and receive online support over a one year or multiyear maintenance service period revenue from our maintenance program is reported separately on our consolidated statements of operations and is referred to throughout this document as maintenance revenue 

upgrade pricing offers customers who are not on the maintenance program an opportunity to purchase upgrades at current available prices but only to the extent that they are still on an autodesksupported version of the product an existing customer whether or not on maintenance also has the option to upgrade for a premium fee to a different vertical or modelbased design product which generally has a higher price we refer to this as a crossgrade the cost of a crossgrade is less than the cost of purchasing a new license during fiscal 2010 the typical cost to upgrade was based on a multiple of the number of versions the customer was upgrading effective march 17 2010 autodesk replaced its upgradecrossgrade pricing model with a new model where upgrades and crossgrades from the three previous software releases are priced at a percentage of a full license revenue from upgrades and crossgrades are reported on our consolidated statements of operations in “license and other” 

  

our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller networks the loss of or a significant reduction in business with any one of our major distributors or large resellers could harm our business see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

customer and reseller support 

we provide technical support and training to customers through a leveraged support model augmented by direct programs designed to address certain specific needs our customers rely primarily on the resellers and distributors from which they purchased licenses to our products for technical support however we do provide certain direct support for some of our customers we support our resellers and distributors through technical product training sales training classes the internet and telephone we also provide online support directly to our customers through our maintenance program there are also a number of user group forums in which customers are able to share information 

educational programs 

we offer education programs and specially priced software purchasing options tailored for educational institutions students and faculty to train the next generation of users we also offer classroom support including standardized curricula developed by educators instructor development and a rich assortment of online learning resources users trained on our products are broadly available both from educational institutions and the existing workforce reducing the cost of training for our customers 

developer programs 

one of our key strategies is to maintain an openarchitecture design of our software products to facilitate thirdparty development of complementary products and industryspecific software solutions this approach enables customers and third parties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses we offer several programs that provide marketing sales technical support and programming tools to developers who develop addon applications for our products over 3400 developers in the autodesk developer network create interoperable products that further enhance the range of integrated solutions available to our customers 

backlog 

we typically ship products shortly after receipt of an order which is common in the software industry our aggregate backlog is primarily comprised of deferred revenue deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred maintenance revenue from our maintenance program to a lesser extent deferred revenue consists of deferred license and other revenue derived from collaborative project management services consulting services and deferred license sales backlog also includes current software license product orders which have not yet shipped the category of current software license product orders which we have not yet shipped consists of orders from customers with approved credit status for currently available license software products and may include both orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period 

aggregate backlog was 5425 million at january 31 2010 of which 5165 million was deferred revenue and 260 million related to current software license product orders which had not yet shipped at the end of the fiscal year aggregate backlog was 5695 million at january 31 2009 of which 5521 million was deferred revenue and 174 million related to current software license product orders which had not yet shipped at the end of the fiscal year deferred revenue decreased over the prior year primarily due to a decrease in new and renewal maintenance contracts during fiscal 2010 

  

 competition 

the markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to rapid change we strive to increase our competitive separation by investing in research and development allowing us to bring new products to market and create exciting new versions of existing products that offer compelling efficiencies for our customers we also compete through investments in marketing and sales 

our pseb aec mfg and me segments compete with vendors that specialize primarily in one of the four industry segments in which we compete our competitors range from large global publicly traded companies to small geographically focused firms our primary global competitors in these segments include adobe systems incorporated ansys inc bentley systems incorporated dassault systèmes sa and its subsidiary dassault systèmes solidworks corp environmental systems research institute inc esri google inc intergraph corporation nemetschek ag parametric technology corporation and siemens product lifecycle software inc 

our me segment also competes with a wide range of different companies from large global publiclytraded companies to small private entities large organizations that produce products that compete in some or all of our markets include adobe systems incorporated apple inc avid technology inc sony corporation and thomson the media and entertainment market is highly fragmented with complex interdependencies between many of the larger corporations as a result some of our competitors also own subsidiaries that are our customers or our partners in developing or bringing to market some of our solutions 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing power with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the design software market is characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete both from existing competitors and by entry of competitors with innovative technologies competition is increasingly enhanced by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources than we do because of these and other factors competitive conditions in these industries are likely to continue to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which could harm our business furthermore in certain markets some of our competitors have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion of risks regarding competition 

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our abilities to offer new products whether by internal development or acquisition and to continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to ease of use reliability performance range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation price and training 

intellectual property and licenses 

we maintain an active program to legally protect our investment in technology through intellectual property rights we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions the nature and extent of legal protection associated with each such intellectual property right depends on among other things the type of intellectual property right and the given jurisdiction in which such right arises we believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business including each of our segments 

nonetheless our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws enforcement of intellectual property rights against alleged infringers can sometimes lead to costly litigation and counterclaims our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business 

  

from time to time we receive claims alleging infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights including patents disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to among other things costly litigation or product shipment delays which could harm our business 

we retain ownership of software we develop all software is licensed to users and primarily provided in object code pursuant to either shrinkwrap embedded or online licenses or signed license agreements these agreements contain restrictions on duplication disclosure and transfer 

we believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our intellectual property and the rapid ongoing technological changes in both the computer hardware and software industries we must rely principally upon software engineering and marketing skills to maintain and enhance our competitive market position 

while we have recovered some revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the full extent to which piracy of our software products exists we believe however that software piracy is and can be expected to be a persistent problem that negatively impacts our revenue and financial results 

in addition through various licensing arrangements we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others we expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing arrangements in the future as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions to support continued development and sales of our products and services some of these licensing arrangements require or may require royalty payments and other licensing fees the amount of these payments and fees may depend on various factors including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments offsetting considerations if any and the degree of use of the licensed technology 

see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion of risks related to protecting our intellectual property 

production and suppliers 

production of our pseb aec mfg and certain me software products involves duplication of the software media and for certain products the printing of user manuals the purchase of media and the transfer of the software programs onto media for distribution to customers are performed by us and by licensed subcontractors media for our products include dvds which are available from multiple sources we offer our maintenance customers an electronic software download option for selected product updates customers who choose electronic fulfillment receive the latest version of the software from our vendor’s secure servers for certain of our products user manuals are made available by request only as we work toward reducing our cost of shipping and production as well as the use of natural resources user manuals and packaging materials are produced to our specifications by outside sources production is either performed in leased facilities operated by us or by independent thirdparty contractors to date we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the production of our software and documentation 

employees 

as of january 31 2010 we employed approximately 6800 people none of our employees in the united states are represented by a labor union however in certain foreign countries our employees are represented by work councils we have never experienced any work stoppages and believe our employee relations are good reliance upon employees in other countries entails various risks that possible government instability or regulation unfavorable to foreignowned businesses could negatively impact our business in the future 

  

 business combinations 

over the past three years we acquired new technology or supplemented our technology by purchasing businesses focused in specific markets or industries during this time period we acquired a number of companies including the following companies that have a significant impact on our business and are discussed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

 glossary of terms 

horizontal design products— autodesk’s autocad and autocad lt products which serve as the platform upon which our vertical design products are based our horizontal design products are primarily developed by the pseb segment these products include our core design applications and can be used across a number of industries and disciplines in the past we have referred to these products as 2d horizontal products we have modified that reference to more accurately reflect these products’ functionality and general design nature

 item 1a risk factors tableend we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves significant risks a number of which are beyond our control in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following discussion highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on our business financial condition and future results of operations if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted causing the trading price of our common stock to decline in addition these risks and uncertainties may impact the “forwardlooking” statements described elsewhere in this form 10k and in the documents incorporated herein by reference they could affect our actual results of operations causing them to differ materially from those expressed in “forwardlooking” statements 

if global economic conditions do not improve or further deteriorate our financial results may be further harmed 

as our business has expanded globally we have increasingly become subject to risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic and political conditions global economic conditions have deteriorated over the past several quarters and it is not yet clear whether a sustainable recovery is currently taking place this has led to our customers deferring reducing or cancelling purchases in response to tighter credit negative financial news and weaker financial performance of their businesses over the past several quarters many of our customers have reduced their work forces thereby reducing the number of licenses and the number of maintenance contracts they purchase from us these factors have negatively impacted our business and our financial results 

these actions have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our business financial results and financial condition in addition the negative effect these factors have had on our cash flows has caused us to restructure our business and in turn incur restructuring charges as well as take impairment charges on some of our longterm assets and may cause us to take additional restructuring actions and charges in the future 

if global economic conditions further deteriorate or our customers continue to struggle under these pressures our customers may further delay reduce or cancel their technology purchases this could result in further reductions in sales of our products longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition if global economic conditions do not improve or our customers’ businesses do not improve our customers may further delay reduce or cancel their technology purchases this could result in stagnation of our sales and our revenue 

in addition continued weakness in the enduser market could further negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could in turn delay paying their obligations to us this would in turn increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue on future sales to these customers 

a significant portion of our revenue is generated through maintenance revenue decreases in maintenance attach or renewal rates or a decrease in the number of new licenses we sell negatively impacts our future revenue and operating results 

our maintenance customers have no obligation to attach maintenance to their initial license or renew their maintenance contract after the expiration of their initial maintenance period which is typically one year our customers’ attach and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors if our customers do not attach maintenance to their initial license or renew their maintenance contract for our products our maintenance revenue will decline and our business will suffer in addition a portion of the growth of our maintenance revenue has typically been associated with growth of the number of licenses that we sell any reduction in the number of licenses that we sell even if our customers’ attach rates do not change will have a negative impact on our future maintenance revenue this in turn would impact our business and harm our financial results over the past several quarters we have experienced a reduction in the number of licenses and maintenance contracts sold as a result of increased unemployment this in turn has negatively impacted our business and our financial results 

  

the growth in billings for maintenance contracts began to slow in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 and maintenance billings declined year over year in the twelve months ended january 31 2010 we recognize the revenue ratably over the life of the maintenance contracts which is predominantly one year but may also be two or three year terms this yearoveryear decrease in maintenance billings will cause downward pressure on future maintenance revenue however future maintenance revenue will also be impacted by other factors such as the amount timing and mix of contract terms of future billings 

our operating results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenue and operating results difficult to predict 

our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines in addition to the other factors described in this part i item 1a some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we have also experienced fluctuations in operating results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic conditions in particular our operating results in europe during our third quarter are usually affected by a slow summer period and our asia pacific operations typically experience seasonal slowing in our third and fourth quarters 

our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenue and are relatively fixed in the short term accordingly any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability greater than anticipated expenses or a failure to maintain rigorous cost controls would also negatively affect profitability further gross margins may be adversely affected if our sales of advanced systems products which historically have had lower margins grow at a faster rate than sales of our highermargin products 

net revenue or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline 

the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 for example current global economic conditions have negatively impacted our financial performance and in turn the market price of our common stock 

significant changes in the price of our common stock could expose us to additional costly and timeconsuming litigation historically after periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities a company becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management’s attention and resources 

  

the actions that we have taken in response to the global economic slowdown and our related business slowdown have been costly and may not be as effective as anticipated and we may be forced to take additional actions to reduce our expenses and stimulate demand for our products 

we have taken actions to reduce our cost structure to more closely align our costs with our revenue levels in taking these actions we are attempting to balance the cost of such initiatives against the longer term benefit of such initiatives and our overall competitive strategy in taking these actions we have incurred additional costs in the short term that have had and may continue to have the effect of reducing our operating margins if we do not achieve the proper balance of these cost reduction initiatives we may eliminate critical elements of our operations the loss of which could negatively impact our ability to benefit from an economic recovery we cannot assure that our cost cutting efforts will achieve appropriate levels of expenses and future economic conditions may require that we take additional actions in the future 

in addition we have taken and continue to take actions to stimulate demand for our products through a number of programs although we are attempting to balance the cost of these programs against the longer term benefits it is possible that we will make such investments without a corresponding increase in demand for our products this would further reduce our operating margins and have a negative impact on our financial results 

if we do not maintain our relationships with the members of our distribution channel or achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected if our distribution channel suffers financial losses becomes financially unstable or insolvent or is not provided the right mix of incentives to sell our products our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected 

we sell our software products both directly to endusers and through a network of distributors and resellers for the fiscal year ended january 31 2010 approximately 83 of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the future our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller network computer software distributors and resellers typically are not highly capitalized have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and are experiencing difficulties in the current economic environment we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of distributors and resellers prior to our sales to them in the past we have taken steps to support them and may take additional steps in the future such as extending credit terms and providing temporary discounts which could harm our operating results if our distributors and resellers were to become insolvent their inability to maintain their business and sales as well as to provide customer support services would negatively impact our business and revenue 

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including distributors tech data corporation and its global affiliates “tech data” tech data accounted for 14 of our consolidated net revenue for each of the fiscal years ended january 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

over time we have modified and will continue to modify aspects of our relationship with our distributors and resellers such as their incentive programs pricing to them and our distribution model to motivate and reward them for aligning their businesses with our strategy and business objectives changes in these relationships and underlying programs could negatively impact their business and harm our business in addition the loss of or a significant reduction in business with those distributors or resellers or the failure to achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough with any one of our major international distributors or large resellers could harm our business in particular if one or more of such distributors or resellers were unable to meet their obligations with respect to accounts payable to us we could be forced to write off such accounts and may be required to delay the recognition of revenue on future sales to these customers which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period 

  

the recent global credit and banking crisis that has occurred over the past several quarters has negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect our business financial conditions and results of operations 

the recent global financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets and other financial institutions has resulted in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in many financial instrument markets our business has been impacted by these events and may be further impacted from this global credit and banking crisis by 

 

  

  

  

  

 because we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from autocadbased software products if these products are not successful our net revenue will be adversely affected 

we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from sales of licenses of autocad software including products based on autocad that serve specific vertical markets upgrades to those products and products that are interoperable with autocad as such any factor adversely affecting sales of these products including the product release cycle market acceptance product competition performance and reliability reputation price competition economic and market conditions and the availability of thirdparty applications would likely harm our operating results for example during the fiscal year ended january 31 2010 combined revenue from our autocad and autocad lt products decreased 34 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year harming our operating results 

from time to time we are subject to litigation and regulatory inquiries and we may be named in additional litigation or become involved in regulatory inquiries in the future all of which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price for our securities 

from time to time we are involved in litigation or regulatory inquiries the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as our business has evolved any claims or regulatory actions initiated by or against us whether successful or not could be time consuming result in costly litigation damage awards injunctive relief increased costs of business require us to change our business practices require significant amounts of management time result in the diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business 

we are dependent on international revenue and operations exposing us to significant regulatory global economic intellectual property collections currency exchange rate taxation and other risks which could adversely impact our financial results 

we are dependent on our international operations for a significant portion of our revenue our international revenue including that from emerging economies is subject to general economic and political conditions in foreign markets including conditions in foreign markets resulting from economic and political conditions in the us our revenue is also impacted by the relative geographical and country mix of our revenue over time these factors have recently adversely impacted and may in the future adversely impact our international revenue and consequently our business as a whole further our dependency on international revenue makes us much more exposed to global economic trends which can negatively impact our financial results even if our results in the us are strong for a particular period 

  

in addition we anticipate that our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue and as we expand our international development sales and marketing expertise will provide significant support to our overall efforts in countries outside of the us risks inherent in our international operations include fluctuating currency exchange rates including risks related to any hedging activities we undertake unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and practices delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology tariffs quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions transportation delays operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales and development operations longer collection cycles for accounts receivable potential changes in tax laws tax arrangements with foreign governments and laws regarding the management of data possible future limitations upon foreign owned businesses increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities inadequate local infrastructure greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property and other factors beyond our control including terrorism war natural disasters and diseases 

existing and increased competition may reduce our net revenue and profits 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of desktop computers with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the markets in which we compete are characterized by vigorous competition both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources furthermore a reduction in the number and availability of compatible thirdparty applications may adversely affect the sale of our products because of these and other factors competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future increased competition could result in continued price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which would likely harm our business 

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer products that compete favorably with respect to reliability performance ease of use range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation and price 

if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights our business could be harmed 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright and trademark laws trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software products or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our software products is timeconsuming and costly while we have recovered some revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists and software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem furthermore our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 

additionally we actively protect the secrecy of our confidential information and trade secrets including our source code if unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code the loss of future trade secret protection could make it easier for thirdparties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our financial performance and our reputation we also seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of nondisclosure agreements with our customers contractors vendors and partners however it is possible that our confidential information and trade secrets may be disclosed or published without our authorization if this were to occur it may be difficult andor costly for us to enforce our rights and our financial performance and reputation could be negatively impacted 

  

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 

as more software patents are granted worldwide the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grow and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlap we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims infringement or misappropriation claims have in the past been and may in the future be asserted against us and any such assertions could harm our business additionally certain patent holders without products have become more aggressive in threatening and pursuing litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents any such claims or threats whether with or without merit have been and could in the future be timeconsuming to defend result in costly litigation and diversion of resources cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in addition such royalty or license agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms if at all which would likely harm our business 

a breach of security in our products or computer systems may compromise the integrity of our products harm our reputation create additional liability and adversely impact our financial results 

we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our product source code and computer systems there appears to be an increasing number of computer “hackers” developing and deploying a variety of destructive software programs such as viruses worms and the like that could attack our products and computer systems despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such programs it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk like all software products our software is vulnerable to such attacks the impact of such an attack could disrupt the proper functioning of our software products cause errors in the output of our customers’ work allow unauthorized access to sensitive proprietary or confidential information of ours or our customers and other destructive outcomes if this were to occur our reputation may suffer customers may stop buying our products we could face lawsuits and potential liability and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to section 404 we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting the report contains among other matters an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 

while we have determined in our management report on internal control over financial reporting included in this annual report on form 10k that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 31 2010 we must continue to monitor and assess our internal control over financial reporting if our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and such weakness remains uncorrected at fiscal year end we will be unable to assert such internal control is effective at fiscal year end if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective at fiscal yearend or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or concludes that we have a material weakness in our internal controls we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which would likely have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 

  

in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions judgments and estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements which if not accurate may significantly impact our financial results 

we make assumptions judgments and estimates for a number of items including the fair value of goodwill financial instruments longlived assets and other intangible assets the realizability of deferred tax assets and the fair value of stock awards we also make assumptions judgments and estimates in determining the accruals for employee related liabilities including commissions bonuses and sabbaticals and in determining the accruals for uncertain tax positions partner incentive programs product returns reserves allowances for doubtful accounts asset retirement obligations and legal contingencies these assumptions judgments and estimates are drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances as of the date of the consolidated financial statements actual results could differ materially from our estimates and such differences could significantly impact our financial results 

changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business further such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective for example in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued two new pieces of authoritative guidance on revenue recognition changing previous guidance in this technical accounting area these changes will be effective for us february 1 2011 we are currently assessing the impact that the adoption of these new accounting pronouncements will have on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

in addition the fasb is currently working on a joint project with the international accounting standards board regarding revenue recognition the objective of this project is to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and create a joint revenue recognition standard for generally accepted accounting principles in the us “gaap” and international financial reporting standards although a proposed standard has not yet been issued it is expected that any proposed standard would result in changes to the way we recognize and report revenue under gaap we are currently unable to estimate the impact that these changes will have on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

furthermore during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 the state of california enacted legislation significantly altering california tax law as a result of the newly enacted legislation we expect that in fiscal years 2012 and beyond our income subject to tax in california will be less than under prior tax law and accordingly our deferred tax assets are less likely to be realized 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the us and we make certain business and resource decisions based on assumptions about foreign currency we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 

we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our earnings exposure and cash flow exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as part of our risk management strategy we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage a portion of our exposures of underlying assets liabilities and other obligations which exist as part of our ongoing business operations these foreign currency instruments have maturities that extend for one to 12 months in the future and provide us with some protection against currency exposures our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our financial results 

  

the fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period although we have expanded our foreign currency cash flow hedge program beyond the current quarter to a longer term program in order to reduce foreign currency volatility we cannot completely mitigate this risk and in any case will incur transaction fees in adopting such hedging programs such volatility even when it increases our revenues or decreases our expenses impacts our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings 

our investment portfolio is composed of a variety of investment vehicles in a number of countries that are subject to interest rate trends market volatility and other economic factors if general economic conditions further cause interest rates to decline credit ratings of our investments to deteriorate or illiquidity in the financial marketplace we may continue to experience a decline in interest income an inability to sell our investments or impairment in the value of our investments 

it is our policy to invest our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in highly liquid instruments with and in the custody of financial institutions with high credit ratings and to limit the amounts invested with any one institution type of security and issuer however we are subject to general economic conditions interest rate trends and volatility in the financial marketplace that can affect the income that we receive from our investments the net realizable value of our investments including our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and our ability to sell them in the us for example the yields on our portfolio securities are very low due to general economic conditions any one of these factors could reduce our interest income or result in material charges which in turn could impact our overall net income and earnings per share 

for example if we were to experience a loss on any of these investments that loss may cause us to record an otherthantemporary impairment charge the effect of this charge could impact our overall net income and earnings per share in any of these scenarios our liquidity may be negatively impacted which in turn may prohibit us from making investments in our business taking advantage of opportunities and potentially meeting our financial obligations as they come due 

our strategy to develop and introduce new product and service offerings including new product features exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance costs related to product defects and large expenditures that may not result in additional net revenue 

rapid technological changes as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences characterize the software industry we devote significant resources to the development of new technologies such as our vertical design products and our digital prototyping and collaboration products in addition we frequently introduce new business models or methods that require a considerable investment of technical and financial resources we are making such investments through further development and enhancement of our existing products as well as through acquisitions of new product lines such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs or competitors may introduce new products and services that achieve acceptance among our current customers adversely affecting our competitive position 

in particular a critical component of our growth strategy is to have customers of our autocad and autocad lt products expand their portfolios to include our related vertical design products and our modelbased design products such as our autodesk inventor products our autodesk revit products our autocad civil 3d products and our autodesk navisworks products should sales of our autocad and autocad lt products decrease without a corresponding increase in vertical design and modelbased design product revenue or without purchases of customer seats to our vertical design products and modelbased design products our results of operations will be adversely affected 

additionally the software products we offer are complex and despite extensive testing and quality control may contain errors or defects these errors or defects could result in the need for corrective releases to our software products damage to our reputation loss of revenue an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products any of which would likely harm our business 

  

further given the rapid speed of changing customer expectations and advancement of technology inherent in the software industry as well as the extensive and complex efforts required to create useful and widely accepted products our executive management team must act quickly continuously and with vision although we have articulated a strategy that we believe will fulfill these challenges if we fail to execute properly on that strategy adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve fail to internalize and execute on that strategy we may fail to meet our customers’ expectations fail to compete with our competitors’ products and technology and lose the confidence of our channel partners and employees this in turn could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our business could suffer as a result of risks costs and charges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments 

we regularly acquire or invest in businesses software products and technologies that are complementary to our business through acquisitions strategic alliances or equity investments the risks associated with such acquisitions include among others the difficulty of assimilating products operations and personnel the failure to realize anticipated revenue and cost projections the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business in accordance with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and the diversion of management’s time and attention 

in addition such acquisitions and investments may involve significant transaction or integrationrelated costs we may not be successful in overcoming such risks and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business in addition such acquisitions and investments have in the past and may in the future contribute to potential fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations these fluctuations could arise from transactionrelated costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or writeoffs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments for example during our first quarter of fiscal 2010 we recorded an impairment charge of 210 million related to goodwill associated with an acquisition in our me segment in addition we recorded an impairment charge of 1289 million during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 also primarily related to goodwill associated with acquisitions in our me segment we also may need to make further investments to support these acquired companies and may have difficulty identifying and acquiring appropriate resources these costs or charges could negatively impact our results of operations for a given period cause quarter to quarter variability in our operating results or negatively impact our operating results for several future periods 

our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our success depends largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical professional managerial sales and marketing personnel historically competition for these key personnel has been intense the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions and financial goals 

our operating results could be negatively impacted if our tax positions are successfully challenged by tax authorities 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions our effective tax rate is based on our expected geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany transfer pricing and enacted tax rules significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis we believe our tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 

  

we rely on third party technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies our product and service development may be delayed and our operating results negatively impacted 

we rely on certain software that we license from third parties including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions these thirdparty software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and the software may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software can be developed identified licensed and integrated which would likely harm our business 

disruptions with licensing relationships and third party developers could adversely impact our business 

we license certain key technologies from third parties licenses may be restricted in the term or the use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business similarly we may not be able to obtain or renew license agreements for key technology on favorable terms if at all and any failure to do so could harm our business 

our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with thirdparty developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn in particular markets such disruption have in the past and would likely in the future negatively impact these thirdparty developers and end users which could harm our business 

additionally technology created by outsourced product development whether outsourced to third parties or developed externally and transferred to us through business or technology acquisitions have certain additional risks such as effective integration into existing products adequate transfer of technology knowhow and ownership and protection of transferred intellectual property 

as a result of our strategy of partnering with other companies for product development our product delivery schedules could be adversely affected if we experience difficulties with our product development partners 

we partner with certain independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities we believe our partnering strategy allows us to among other things achieve efficiencies in developing new products and maintaining and enhancing existing product offerings our partnering strategy creates a dependency on such independent developers independent developers including those who currently develop products for us in the us and throughout the world may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future in addition use of development resources through consulting relationships particularly in nonus jurisdictions with developing legal systems may be adversely impacted by and expose us to risks relating to evolving employment export and intellectual property laws these risks could among other things expose our intellectual property to misappropriation and result in disruptions to product delivery schedules 

we rely on thirdparties to provide us with a number of operational services including hosting and delivery certain of our customer services operations as well as some of our operations any interruption or delay in service from these third parties breaches of security or privacy or failures in data collection could expose us to liability harm our reputation and adversely impact our financial performance 

we rely on hosted computer services from third parties for services that we provide our customers and computer operations for our internal use as we gather customer data and host certain customer data in thirdparty facilities a security breach could compromise the integrity or availability of customer data in addition our operations could be negatively affected in the event of a security breach and we could be subject to the loss or theft of confidential or proprietary information including source code unauthorized access to this data may be obtained through breakins breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party employee theft or misuse or other misconduct 

  

we rely on a number of third party suppliers in the operation of our business for the provision of various services and materials that we use in the operation of our business and production of our products although we seek to diversify our third party suppliers we may from time to time rely on a single or limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single country for these services or materials the inability of such third parties to satisfy our requirements could disrupt our business operations or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy if any of these situations were to occur our reputation could be harmed we could be subject to third party liability including under data protection and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions and our financial performance could be negatively impacted 

we regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems disrupt our operations our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network and data center infrastructure internal technology systems and our websites for our development marketing operational support sales accounting and financial reporting activities we are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet the growing requirements of our business and customers such improvements are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or uncover problems with our existing technology systems unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in disruption in our business operations loss of revenue errors in our accounting and financial reporting or damage to our reputation

strategy 

our goal is to be the world’s leading design engineering and entertainment software and services company for the architecture engineering and construction manufacturing and digital media and entertainment markets worldwide business trends such as globalization sustainability investment in infrastructure and the increasing desire to keep data digital are creating pressure on our customers to improve innovation while enhancing productivity we enable customer innovation by delivering the broadest portfolio of products and services for the digital design visualization and simulation of realworld project performance our products help our customers increase efficiency and productivity while solving business challenges our customers are seeking differentiation through design and we believe our products provide them with a competitive advantage to succeed in this environment 

to achieve our goal we believe that we can capitalize on our competitive advantages including our ability to make technology available to mainstream markets by innovating in existing technology categories we bring powerful design products to volume markets our products are designed to be easy to learn and use and to provide customers low cost of deployment low total cost of ownership and rapid return on their investment in addition our software architecture allows for extensibility and integration with other products we believe that our technological leadership brand recognition breadth of product line and large installed base positions us well for longerterm growth 

we believe that our large global network of distributors and resellers thirdparty developers customers and students is also a competitive advantage these relationships provide us with a broad reach into volume markets our distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with global resources for the purchase and support of our products as well as resources for effective and costefficient training services we believe that our network of channel partners positions us well for longerterm growth in addition we have a significant number of registered thirdparty developers that create products that operate with our software products further extending our reach into volume markets users trained on our products are broadly available from both educational institutions and the existing workforce providing us with a student community of nextgeneration professional users and reducing the cost of training for our customers to train the next generation of users we offer education programs including classroom support standardized curricula instructor development and specially priced softwarepurchasing options 

  

we believe our competitive advantages will help us manage through the current challenging economic environment and position us well as economies begin to recover 

our strategy to grow over the long term derives from these core strengths our growth strategy includes continually increasing the business value of our design tools in a number of ways and improving the performance and functionality of our existing products with each new release our most recent release began in march 2010 beyond our nonindustry or discipline specific horizontal design products autocad and autocad lt we develop products addressing industry or disciplinespecific needs through our vertical design and modelbased design product offerings we continually strive to improve our product functionality and specialization by industry while increasing product interoperability and usability we also strive to create innovative ways of delivering better user experiences to our customers we believe this ultimately increases our customers’ satisfaction the usefulness of our products to our customers and drives customer loyalty 

we believe that expanding our horizontal design product customers’ portfolios to include our vertical design products and modelbased design products presents a meaningful growth opportunity and is an important part of our overall strategy for fiscal 2010 revenue from modelbased design products decreased 19 as compared to the prior fiscal year but as a percentage of total revenue increased to 29 in fiscal 2010 compared to 27 in fiscal 2009 we believe that the adoption of vertical design products and modelbased design products by our customers in all industries will increase their productivity as well as result in richer design data this migration also poses various risks to us in particular if we do not successfully expand our horizontal design customer base to our vertical design products and modelbased design products as expected then we would not realize the growth we expect and our business would be adversely affected 

expanding our geographic coverage is another key element of our growth strategy we believe that emerging economies continue to present longterm growth opportunities for us although revenue from emerging economies declined 37 during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 revenue from emerging economies represented 15 of fiscal 2010 net revenue as compared to 18 of fiscal 2009 net revenue while we believe there are longterm growth opportunities in emerging economies conducting business in these countries presents significant challenges including economic volatility geopolitical risk intellectual property protection and software piracy 

our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products technology and businesses acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers however they entail integration challenges and may in certain instances negatively impact our operating margins we continually review these tradeoffs in making our decisions of whether to make acquisitions the size and frequency of transactions to acquire products technology and businesses decreased significantly during fiscal 2010 as compared to earlier periods we currently anticipate that we will selectively acquire products technology and businesses as compelling opportunities that promote our strategy become available but the pace at which we make such investments will vary depending upon our business needs the availability of suitable sellers and technology and our own financial condition 

global economic conditions deteriorated significantly in fiscal 2010 as compared to the conditions that existed during most of fiscal 2009 economic contraction in most countries and markets and global financial market instability including tighter credit has impacted our business we have seen demand for our products and services decline in each of our major geographies and all the industries we serve during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 this has negatively impacted our financial results our operating margins are very sensitive to changes in revenue given the relatively fixed nature of most of our expenses which consist primarily of employeerelated expenditures facilities costs and depreciation and amortization expense we have taken actions in response to these global economic changes that we believe will improve our financial condition in fiscal 2011 and beyond we believe that by continuing to execute our strategy we can achieve our goal of being the world’s leading design and engineering software and services company for the architecture engineering and construction manufacturing geospatial mapping and digital media and entertainment markets 

  

our strategy depends upon a number of assumptions including that we will be able to continue making our technology available to mainstream markets leverage our large global network of distributors and resellers thirdparty developers customers and students improve the performance and functionality of our products and that we can adequately protect our intellectual property if the outcome of any of these assumptions differs from our expectations we may not be able to implement our strategy which could potentially adversely affect our business for further discussion regarding these and related risks see part i item 1a “risk factors” 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we regularly reevaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we believe that of all our significant accounting policies the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 

for multiple element arrangements that include software products we allocate the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on their vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value vsoe is the price charged when an element is sold separately or a price set by management with the relevant authority if we do not have vsoe of an undelivered software license we defer revenue recognition on the entire sales arrangement until all elements for which we do not have vsoe are delivered if we do not have vsoe for undelivered maintenance or services the revenue for the arrangement is recognized over the longest contractual period in the arrangement we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 

our assessment of likelihood of collection is also a critical factor in determining the timing of revenue recognition if we do not believe that collection is probable the revenue will be deferred until the earlier of when collection is deemed probable or payment is received 

our indirect channel model includes both a twotiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a onetiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers our product license revenue from distributors and resellers are generally recognized at the time title to our product passes to the distributor in a twotiered structure or reseller in a onetiered structure provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met this policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns among other criteria we are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers our policy also presumes that we have no significant performance obligations in connection with the sale of our product licenses by our distributors and resellers to their customers if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

  

product returns reserves we permit our distributors and resellers to return products up to a percentage of prior quarter purchases the product returns reserve is based on historical experience of actual product returns estimated channel inventory levels the timing of new product introductions and promotions channel sellin for applicable markets and other factors 

our product returns reserves were 118 million at january 31 2010 and 125 million at january 31 2009 product returns as a percentage of applicable revenue were 52 in fiscal 2010 36 in fiscal 2009 and 35 in fiscal 2008 during fiscal year 2010 and 2009 we recorded additions to our product returns reserves of 429 million and 531 million respectively which reduced our revenue 

marketable securities at january 31 2010 we had 2875 million of short and longterm marketable securities we review our investments in marketable securities quarterly for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment this determination requires significant judgment in making this determination we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and our intent and ability to hold the investment we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the sponsor including industry and sector performance operational and financing cash flow factors and rating agency actions once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded to our consolidated statements of operations this impairment results in a new cost basis in the investment recorded in our consolidated balance sheets if market industry andor sponsor conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments 

determining the fair value of marketable securities that are not actively traded requires significant judgment at january 31 2010 we had an investment in the reserve international liquidity fund the “international fund” a money market fund with an estimated fair value of 100 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 the international fund ceased redemptions after net asset values of the funds decreased below 1 per share this occurred as a result of the international fund revaluing its holdings of debt securities issued by lehman brothers which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on september 15 2008 and the resulting unusually high redemption requests on the international fund a third party court appointed supervisor is overseeing but not managing the accounting and payment administration of the non usbased international fund our investment in the international fund is not currently liquid and in the event we need to access these funds we will not be able to do so however based on currently available information we expect to recover substantially all of our current holdings net of reserves from the international fund within the next 12 months accordingly the investment in the international fund is classified in current “marketable securities” in the consolidated balance sheets 

in addition at january 31 2010 we owned two auction rate securities with an estimated fair value of 76 million our auction rate securities are variable rate debt instruments that have underlying securities with contractual maturities greater than ten years and interest rates that were structured to reset at auction every 28 days the securities which met our investment guidelines at the time the investments were made have failed to settle in auctions since august 2007 and have earned a premium interest rate since that time while we expect to recover substantially all of our current holdings net of reserves in the auction rate securities we cannot predict when this will occur or the amount we will receive due to the lack of liquidity of these investments they are included in noncurrent “marketable securities” in the consolidated balance sheets 

goodwill we test goodwill for impairment annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment when assessing goodwill for impairment we use discounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether goodwill is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge impairment charges if any result from instances where the fair values of net assets associated with goodwill are less than their carrying values as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

  

we recorded an impairment charge of 210 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 representing the entire goodwill balance of our me segment as of april 30 2009 this goodwill balance related to our me segment’s fourth quarter fiscal 2009 acquisition of substantially all of the assets of softimage in may 2009 we concluded that an impairment of goodwill had occurred as of april 30 2009 due to revisions to our revenue and cash flow projections in response to the significant and sustained revenue declines we were experiencing in all segments and geographies in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 the revenue and cash flow projections were substantially impacted for all segments and our me segment was the only segment which had a fair value of its future discounted cash flows that fell below the carrying value of its net assets 

we recorded an impairment charge of 1282 million affecting the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 representing the entire goodwill balance associated with our media and entertainment “me” segment as of october 31 2008 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 revenue and cash flow projections for all segments were substantially impacted by the sharp downturn in the global economy and in our business our me segment was the only segment which had a current fair value of its future discounted cash flows that fell below the carrying value of its assets should our revenue and cash flow projections decline significantly in the future additional impairment charges may be recorded to goodwill 

as of january 31 2010 a hypothetical 10 decrease in the fair value of our reporting units would not have an impact on the carrying value of goodwill nor result in impairment of goodwill see further discussion of this impairment charge in note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

realizability of longlived assets we assess the realizability of our longlived assets and related intangible assets other than goodwill annually during the fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review significant underperformance of a business or product line relative to budget shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends and the results of past impairment reviews 

in assessing the recoverability of these longlived assets we first determine their fair values which are based on assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows that could reasonably be generated by these assets if impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows we would discount the cash flows to assess impairments on longlived assets variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge impairment charges if any result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values 

in addition to our recoverability assessments we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our longlived assets any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made as well as in subsequent quarters 

we will continue to evaluate the values of our longlived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

income taxes we currently have 1461 million of net deferred tax assets primarily a result of tax credits net operating losses and timing differences for reserves accrued liabilities stock options purchased technologies and capitalized software partially offset by the establishment of us deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries and acquired intangibles and valuation allowances against california and canadian deferred tax assets we perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets and believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax 

  

jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors any change in future profitability may require material adjustments to these net deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determination is made 

stockbased compensation  we measure stockbased compensation cost at the grant date fair value of the award and recognize expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period we estimate the fair value of stockbased payment awards using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model the determination of the fair value of a stockbased award on the date of grant using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors the riskfree interest rate for the expected term of the award and expected dividends the variables used in the model are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted as needed the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

legal contingencies  as described in part i item 3 “legal proceedings” and part ii item 8 note 8 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations

overview of fiscal 2010 results of operations 

 

 our results for fiscal 2010 continue to reflect the recent global economic downturn which has impacted our business on almost every front while global macroeconomic indicators remain mixed there were some slight signs of stabilization during the second half of fiscal 2010 job losses and the availability of credit in the major industries we serve are important indicators for our business there have been significant job losses around the world over the past two years and unemployment remains high in several important geographies including the us additionally there are a number of mixed data points as to whether credit has become more readily available and how this continues to impact our customers and partners our level of confidence in fiscal 2011 revenue forecasts is limited and consequently we are not able to provide full year fiscal 2011 revenue guidance 

  

we believe that the recent economic contraction as well as the financial pressure on our customers have decreased demand for our products as customers have reduced their work forces this has resulted in fewer seats of our design software sold and fewer maintenance contracts being renewed consequently we experienced revenue contraction in most products all geographies and all reportable segments during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 however our business appears to show some signs of stabilizing as evidenced by modest increases in revenue from commercial new seat licenses revenue from every geographic region revenue from each of our product types and revenue from most of our operating segments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2010 in addition we continued to make progress in reducing our operating costs which led to an increase in operating margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 compared to each of the other quarters in fiscal 2010 despite the small growth in these areas it is not clear to us whether these increases represent sustainable trends 

during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 net revenue decreased 26 gross profit decreased 27 operating expenses decreased 21 and income from operations decreased 73 the 73 decrease in income from operations in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the reduction in our net revenue without an equivalent reduction of our costs the majority of our costs are relatively fixed in the short term as they relate primarily to our workforce marketing and sales research and development and general and administrative expenses declined in total by 18 in fiscal 2010 compared to the prior fiscal year due to our cost containment efforts additionally we recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of 210 million in fiscal 2010 compared to 1289 million in the prior fiscal year the unfavorable impacts of our revenue decline during fiscal 2010 were partially offset by lower operating costs resulting from our fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 restructuring plans and other cost containment efforts our spending decisions are based in part on our expectations for future revenue and are not directly variable with fluctuations in revenue accordingly our inability to immediately adjust our operating costs for any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse impact on our profitability 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 we initiated the fiscal 2010 restructuring plan which reduced headcount by approximately 430 positions globally and consolidated approximately 32 leased facilities around the world in order to reduce our operating expenses we took these and other actions in an attempt to better align our cost structure with our recent and anticipated financial results other important actions include reductions in discretionary spending and contingent labor costs 

we generate a significant amount of our revenue in the us japan germany the united kingdom france canada italy south korea australia and china the stronger value of the us dollar relative to most of the other currencies except for the japanese yen against which the dollar weakened had a negative effect on operating income during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 had exchange rates from fiscal 2009 been in effect during fiscal 2010 “on a constant currency basis” net revenue would have decreased 23 compared to a 26 decrease as recorded operating expenses would have decreased 20 compared to 21 as recorded and income from operations would have decreased 59 compared to a 73 decrease as recorded during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue operating expenses and income from operations in future periods we use foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on a portion of the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions but cannot completely mitigate the impact of fluctuation of such foreign currency against the us dollar 

net revenue for the fiscal year ended january 31 2010 decreased 26 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year due to a 39 decrease in license and other revenue which was partially offset by a 3 increase in maintenance revenue we experienced decreases in net revenue in emea apac and the americas during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including tech data corporation and its global affiliates collectively “tech data” tech data accounted for 14 of our consolidated net revenue during both fiscal year 2010 and 2009 

  

our total spend defined as cost of revenue plus operating expenses decreased by 4226 million or 20 in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 exceeding our reduction of total spend goals while the magnitude of the savings is significant we also continued to invest throughout the year in areas important to the future success of autodesk our total spend of 16481 million for fiscal 2010 included 936 million of stockbased compensation expenses 482 million for restructuring charges 329 million attributable to amortization of developed technology for acquisitions subsequent to december 2005 255 million attributable to amortization of customer relationships and trademarks for acquisitions subsequent to december 2005 and 210 for our goodwill impairment 

our total operating margin decreased from 11 of revenue during fiscal 2009 to 4 of revenue during fiscal 2010 the decrease during fiscal 2010 was primarily due to the decrease in our net revenue without an equivalent decrease in costs as well as an increase in costs associated with charges for stockbased compensation and restructuring charges our operating margin was reduced 2 percentage points for stockbased compensation expenses 1 percentage point for amortization of developed technology and 1 percentage point for restructuring charges offsetting these decreases to the operating margin were a 4 percentage point increase in operating margin attributable to lower impairment of goodwill and intangibles and a 1 percentage point increase due to lower charges from acquisitionrelated inprocess research and development expenses in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 marketing and sales research and development and general and administrative expenses decreased during the fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of our cost saving initiatives the reduction in costs did not occur as rapidly as the decline in net revenue during fiscal 2010 and our operating margins suffered as a result 

we expect our operating margin percentage to increase during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 due to lower restructuring charges goodwill impairment and stockbased compensation expenses excluding these items our operating margin percentage is expected to increase 2 to 3 percentage points in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2010 we expect fiscal 2011 operating expenses will decrease however there can be no assurance that our cost structure will not increase in the future or that we will be able to align our cost structure with our actual financial results in addition in taking actions to manage our cost structure we may incur additional costs which could negatively impact our net income and cash flows from operating activities 

our primary goals for fiscal 2011 are to continue delivering our marketleading products and solutions to our customers stimulate revenue growth manage operating margins and invest in product functionality and new product lines while minimizing the impact of these investments on gross profit operating margins operating cash flow and our worldwide operations 

at january 31 2010 we had 11262 million in cash and marketable securities we completed fiscal 2010 with lower deferred revenue balance and a lower accounts receivable balance as compared to fiscal 2009 our deferred revenue balance at january 31 2010 included 4644 million of customer maintenance contracts which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the life of the contracts which is predominantly one year we repurchased 27 million shares of our common stock for 632 million during fiscal 2010 comparatively we repurchased 80 million shares of our common stock for 2566 million during fiscal 2009 

  

results of operations 

net revenue 

 

 fiscal 2010 net revenue compared to fiscal 2009 net revenue 

license and other revenue 

license and other revenue is comprised of two components all forms of product license revenue and other revenue product license revenue includes revenue from the sale of new seat licenses upgrades and crossgrades other revenue consists of revenue from advanced systems consulting and training services autodesk collaborative solution hosting and our former location services division we divested the location services division in february 2009 

total license and other revenue decreased 39 during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 license and other revenue from horizontal design and vertical design products decreased 33 and license and other revenue from modelbased design products decreased 19 each as compared to the prior fiscal year these decreases were primarily due to the 44 decrease in commercial new seat revenue during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 during fiscal 2010 29 percentage points of the 44 decrease was due to decreases in the number of seats sold and 15 percentage points was due to lower average net revenue per seat as a percentage of total net revenue license and other revenue was 57 and 69 for fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively commercial new seat revenue as a percentage of license and other revenue was 61 and 67 for fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively 

also contributing to the decrease in license and other revenue during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was the 32 decrease in upgrade revenue which includes crossgrade revenue the decrease in upgrade revenue was driven primarily by the recent global economic contraction additionally upgrade revenue was 

  

lower during fiscal 2010 because of the relatively smaller size of the upgradeable base of our autocadbased products as compared to the upgradeable base of our autocadbased products during fiscal 2009 due to a higher percentage of customers on our maintenance program which includes unspecified upgrades when and if available over the long term we expect revenue from upgrades to decrease as we continue to move customers onto our maintenance program 

revenue from the sales of our services training and support included in “license and other revenue” represented less than 4 of net revenue for all periods presented 

maintenance revenue 

our maintenance revenue relates to a program known by our user community as the subscription program our maintenance program provides our commercial and educational customers with a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of our new releases and enhancements when and if released during the term of their contracts under our maintenance program customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades when and if available downloadable training courses and online support we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the maintenance contract periods 

maintenance revenue increased 3 during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to a 3 increase in commercial maintenance revenue the increase in commercial maintenance revenue is due to 8 percentage points from higher net revenue per maintenance seat partially offset by 5 percentage points from lower program enrollment due to the economic downturn commercial maintenance revenue represented 98 of maintenance revenue for both fiscal 2010 and 2009 changes in maintenance revenue lag changes in maintenance billings because we recognize the revenue ratably over the life of the maintenance contracts which is predominantly one year our 3 increase in maintenance revenue in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 reflects an 18 increase in maintenance billings in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 partially offset by a 7 decline in maintenance billings in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 as a percentage of total net revenue maintenance revenue was 43 and 31 for fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively total program enrollment at january 31 2010 consisted of about 22 million users the number of users increased from 17 million at january 31 2009 to 22 million at january 31 2010 primarily due to a onetime adjustment of 06 million educational seats for users who were migrated to a standard educational maintenance plan during the second fiscal quarter ended july 31 2009 these users were not previously captured in our maintenance installed base prior to the second quarter of fiscal 2010 we do not believe these additional seats will have a material impact on our future maintenance revenue 

maintenance billings declined 7 in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 this decrease was due to fewer new seats sold and a decrease in renewal rates as customers have reduced their work force the year over year growth in billings for maintenance contracts began to slow in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 although maintenance billings increased slightly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we recognize the revenue ratably over the life of the maintenance contracts which is predominantly one year but may also be two or three year terms this yearoveryear decrease in maintenance billings will cause downward pressure on future maintenance revenue however future maintenance revenue will also be impacted by other factors such as the amount timing and mix of contract terms of future maintenance billings 

aggregate backlog at january 31 2010 and january 31 2009 was 5425 million and 5695 million respectively of which 5165 million and 5521 million respectively represented deferred revenue backlog related to current software license product orders that had not shipped at the end of the quarter increased by 86 million during fiscal 2010 from 174 million at january 31 2009 to 260 million at january 31 2010 deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred maintenance revenue to a lesser extent deferred revenue consists of deferred license and other revenue derived from collaborative project management services consulting services and deferred license sales backlog from current software license product orders that we have not yet shipped consists of orders for currently available licensed software products from customers with approved credit status and may include orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period 

  

net revenue by geographic area 

net revenue in the americas geography decreased by 16 both as reported and on a constant currency basis during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 this decrease was primarily due to a 27 decrease in revenue from new seats partially offset by a 5 increase in upgrade revenue in the americas during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 maintenance revenue growth was flat in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 growth in the americas continues to be affected by a economic volatility that impacted growth rates for all of our products during fiscal 2010 

net revenue in the emea geography decreased by 33 or 26 on a constant currency basis during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 the decrease was primarily due to a 50 decrease in new seat revenue and a 49 decrease in revenue from upgrades these decreases were partially offset by a 2 increase in maintenance revenue in emea during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 the emea geography’s decline in revenue during fiscal 2010 was primarily due to economic contraction in virtually all countries in that geography the decrease in our revenue in that geography was led by emerging economy countries followed by germany france italy and the united kingdom the negative effect of the stronger value of the us dollar relative to the euro the british pound and other european currencies also contributed to the decrease in net revenue in emea 

net revenue in the apac geography decreased by 27 or 28 on a constant currency basis during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to a 38 decrease in new seat revenue and a 42 decrease in upgrade revenue these decreases were partially offset by a 13 increase in maintenance revenue net revenue contraction in the apac geography during fiscal 2010 occurred in virtually all countries led by japan and followed by china south korea india and australia 

revenue from emerging economies decreased 37 during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 revenue from emerging economies represented 15 and 18 of net revenue during fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively this decrease contributed to our international sales contraction during fiscal 2010 

we believe that international net revenue will continue to comprise a majority of our total net revenue the recent economic contractions in the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenue had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business in those countries and our overall financial performance changes in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies have significantly affected and could continue to significantly affect our financial results for a given period even though we hedge a portion of our current and projected revenue international net revenue represented 69 of our net revenue in fiscal 2010 and 72 of our net revenue in fiscal 2009 

net revenue by operating segment 

we have four reportable segments platform solutions and emerging business “pseb” architecture engineering and construction “aec” manufacturing “mfg” and media and entertainment “me” location services “lbs” which we disposed of in february 2009 is not included in any of the above reportable segments and is reflected as other in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we reorganized our business to better align with our customers and accelerate product innovation as part of this change there has been some product movement between business segments including the movement of geospatial and process and power design market products from pseb to aec certain reclassifications to segment revenue and gross profit have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current presentation we have no material intersegment revenue 

net revenue for pseb decreased 31 during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to a 38 decrease in revenue from our autocad lt products and a 31 decrease in revenue from our autocad products offset by a net 12 increase in revenue from all other pseb products and services 

  

net revenue for aec decreased 20 during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to a 24 decrease in revenue from our revit products a 32 decrease in revenue from our autocad architecture products a 15 decrease in revenue from our autocad civil 3d products and a net 13 decrease in revenue from all other aec products and services 

net revenue for mfg decreased 21 during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to a 25 decrease in revenue from our autodesk inventor products and a 34 decrease in revenue from our autodesk mechanical products offset by a net 2 increase in revenue from all other mfg products and services 

net revenue for me decreased 28 during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to a 42 decrease in revenue from advanced systems and an 18 decrease in revenue from our animation product group the decrease in animation revenue was primarily due to a 33 decrease in revenue from autodesk 3ds max and a 17 decrease in revenue from maya offset by a net 32 increase in revenue from all other me products and services 

fiscal 2009 net revenue compared to fiscal 2008 net revenue 

during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 net revenue increased 7 during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 we experienced a dramatic change in the economic conditions of our markets globally the first two quarters of fiscal 2009 were characterized by net revenue growth of 18 over the same period in the prior fiscal year due to the deteriorating global economic conditions during our third and fourth fiscal quarters of fiscal 2009 our results for the second half of fiscal 2009 were a stark contrast to the first half of the fiscal year revenue for the second half of fiscal 2009 declined by 4 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year revenue decreased sequentially 2 and 19 during our third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 respectively 

license and other revenue 

total license and other revenue decreased 1 during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 commercial new seat revenue from our modelbased horizontal and vertical design products for fiscal 2009 was flat compared to fiscal 2008 during fiscal 2009 we experienced a decrease of approximately 13 percentage points due to lower number of seat licenses sold offset by an increase of approximately 13 percentage points due to higher average net revenue per seat during fiscal 2009 there was less correlation between revenue growth and seat license growth due to changes in our mix of geographies and products proportion of maintenance in the user base currency exchange rates and average selling prices and we expect this trend to continue as a percentage of total net revenue license and other revenue was 69 for fiscal 2009 and 75 for fiscal 2008 

upgrade revenue which includes crossgrade revenue decreased by 8 during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 as expected the decrease in upgrade revenue was driven primarily by the relatively smaller size of the upgradeable base of our autocadbased products in fiscal 2009 as compared to the upgradeable base of our autocadbased products in fiscal 2008 due to more customers on our maintenance program 

maintenance revenue 

maintenance revenue increased 29 for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 approximately 20 percentage points of the 29 increase was due to increases in program enrollment and approximately 9 percentage points of the increase was due to higher net revenue per maintenance seat for fiscal 2009 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year as a percentage of total net revenue maintenance revenue was 31 for fiscal 2009 and 25 for fiscal 2008 at january 31 2009 our maintenance program enrollment consisted of about 17 million users 

  

net revenue by geographic area 

net revenue in the americas geography decreased by 3 both as reported and on a constant currency basis during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of a 15 decrease in revenue from new seats in the americas geography and a 19 decrease in revenue from upgrades offset in part by a 16 increase in maintenance revenue growth in the americas geography was affected by a slowing economy that impacted growth rates for all of our products in fiscal 2009 

net revenue in emea geography increased by 15 or 9 on a constant currency basis during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to a 39 increase in maintenance revenue and a 6 increase in new seat revenue slightly offset by a 1 decrease in revenue from upgrades the emea geography’s growth during fiscal 2009 was primarily due to growth in the emea emerging economies as well as in germany france switzerland italy belgium and sweden the positive effect of the weaker value of the us dollar relative to the euro the british pound and other european currencies also contributed to the increase in net revenue in the emea geography 

net revenue in the apac geography increased by 7 or 2 on a constant currency basis during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to a 36 increase in maintenance revenue and a 3 increase in new seat revenue partially offset by a 4 decrease in revenue from upgrades net revenue growth in the apac geography during fiscal 2009 occurred primarily due to growth in japan and australia net revenue from the apac geography emerging economies in fiscal 2009 was flat compared to the prior fiscal year 

international net revenue represented 72 of our net revenue in fiscal 2009 and 69 of our net revenue in fiscal 2008 we started to experience some economic difficulty in international sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 global conditions worsened and the economic downturn significantly impacted our international sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 particularly the robust business we had been seeing in emerging economies net revenue in emerging economies grew by 14 from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 primarily due to revenue from the russian federation other emea emerging economies and india this growth was a significant factor in our international sales growth during fiscal 2009 in contrast fourth quarter fiscal 2009 net revenue in the emea and apac geographies decreased 16 and 25 respectively compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and net revenue from emerging economies declined 31 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year 

net revenue by operating segment 

net revenue for pseb increased 1 during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to a 3 increase in revenue from autocad lt partially offset by a 1 decrease in revenue from autocad 

net revenue for aec increased 9 during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to a 22 increase in revenue from autodesk revit this increase was partially offset by a 13 decrease in revenue from autocad architecture also contributing to the increase in aec’s net revenue during fiscal 2009 was an increase in revenue from the autodesk robot structural analysis robobat and autodesk navisworks products 

net revenue for mfg increased 17 during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to an 8 increase in revenue from autodesk inventor products and a 12 increase in revenue from autocad mechanical contributing 7 percentage points of the 17 increase in mfg’s net revenue for fiscal 2009 was revenue from the autodesk moldflow products of 308 million 

net revenue for me increased 1 during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to a 9 increase in net revenue from our animation product group the increase in animation revenue was primarily due to a 25 increase in revenue from autodesk 3ds max net revenue from advanced systems decreased 8 during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 

  

cost of revenue 

 

 cost of license and other revenue includes labor costs of fulfilling service contracts and order fulfillment including stockbased compensation expense for those employees direct material and overhead charges amortization of purchased technology professional services fees and royalties direct material and overhead charges include the cost of hardware sold mainly pcbased workstations for advanced systems in our me segment costs associated with transferring our software to electronic media printing of user manuals and packaging materials and shipping and handling costs 

cost of license and other revenue decreased 14 during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to the 39 decrease in license and other revenue cost of license and other revenue did not decline as rapidly as the associated net revenue in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 because of increased amortization of purchased technology related to fiscal years 2010 and 2009 acquisitions costs associated with redundant services as we migrated a portion of our it systems onto a new platform and higher costs associated with the implementation of our electronic fulfillment system cost of license and other revenue increased 6 during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 even though license and other revenue decreased by 1 cost of license and other revenue increased in fiscal 2009 due to an increase in amortization of purchased technology due to the number of acquisitions completed during fiscal years 2009 and 2008 slightly offset by decreases in employeerelated expenses since many of these costs are headcountrelated expenses they do not vary proportionally with changes in revenue 

cost of maintenance revenue includes labor costs of providing product support to our maintenance customers including stockbased compensation expense for these employees rent and occupancy and professional services fees cost of maintenance revenue increased 34 during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 due to an increase in product support headcount due to the acquisition of moldflow corporation in the second quarter of fiscal 2009 costs of maintenance revenue remained relatively consistent in both relative dollars and as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 

cost of revenue at least over the near term is affected by the volume and mix of product sales fluctuations in consulting costs amortization of purchased technology new customer support offerings royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products and employee stockbased compensation expense 

marketing and sales 

 

   

marketing and sales expenses include salaries benefits bonuses and stockbased compensation expense for our marketing and sales employees costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue such as advertising trade shows and expositions and various sales and promotional programs marketing and sales expenses also include labor costs of sales and order processing rent and occupancy sales and dealer commissions and the cost of supplies and equipment marketing and sales expenses decreased 19 during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to lower employeerelated costs driven by decreased marketing and sales headcount and decreased travel expenditures and reduced advertising and promotional expenses marketing and sales expense increased 6 during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to higher employeerelated costs driven by increased marketing and sales headcount in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 we expect to balance our need to invest in the marketing and sales of our products with our need to reduce our operating expenses to align with our financial condition 

research and development 

 

 research and development expenses which are expensed as incurred consist primarily of salaries benefits bonuses and stockbased compensation expense for research and development employees rent and occupancy professional services such as fees paid to software development firms and independent contractors and the expense of travel entertainment and training for such personnel research and development expenses decreased 21 during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to decreases in employeerelated costs driven by decreased research and development headcount also contributing to the decline was a decrease in acquisition related inprocess research and development charges from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 research and development expenses increased 17 during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to an increase in employee related costs driven by increased research and development headcount also contributing to the increase in research and development expenses was inprocess research and development from acquisitions during fiscal 2009 these increases were partially offset by a reduction in stockbased compensation expense for our research and development employees 

general and administrative 

 

 general and administrative expenses include salaries benefits bonuses and stockbased compensation expense for our finance human resources and legal personnel as well as professional fees for legal and accounting services cost of supplies and equipment amortization of acquisition related customer relationships and trade names and expense of communication general and administrative expenses decreased 4 from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 primarily due to decreases in employeerelated costs driven by decreased general and administrative headcount and reduced rent and occupancy costs due to the consolidation of facilities this decrease was partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization related to capital expenditures from fiscal 2009 and 2010 general and administrative expenses increased 14 from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 primarily due to increases in employeerelated costs due to an increase in general and administrative headcount and an increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets during fiscal 2009 

  

restructuring 

 

  

 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we initiated a restructuring program in order to reduce our operating costs this program reduced the number of employees by a total of approximately 700 positions globally and resulted in the consolidation of approximately 27 leased facilities in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 we initiated an additional restructuring program which resulted in headcount reduction of approximately 430 positions globally and resulted in the consolidation of approximately 32 leased facilities around the world in order to further reduce our operating expenses in connection with these restructuring programs we recorded restructuring and impairment charges of 482 million and 402 million during fiscal 2010 and 2009 of these amounts 243 million and 367 million were recorded for onetime termination benefits and other costs during fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively and 239 million and 35 million were recorded for facilitiesrelated costs during fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively the onetime termination benefits for these two restructuring programs have been substantially paid as of january 31 2010 we expect to pay the facilityrelated liabilities through fiscal 2018 see note 16 “restructuring reserve” in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

impairment of goodwill and intangibles 

 

  

 we recorded an impairment charge of 210 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 representing the entire goodwill balance of our me segment as of april 30 2009 this goodwill balance related to our me segment’s fourth quarter fiscal 2009 acquisition of substantially all of the assets of softimage in may 2009 we concluded that an impairment of goodwill had occurred as of april 30 2009 due to revisions to our revenue and cash flow projections in response to the significant and sustained revenue declines we were experiencing in all segments and geographies in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 the revenue and cash flow projections were substantially impacted for all segments and our me segment was the only segment which had a fair value of its future discounted cash flows that fell below the carrying value of its net assets 

during fiscal 2009 we recorded a 1289 million impairment charge affecting the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 primarily related to impairment of goodwill associated with our me segment during the three months ended january 31 2009 revenue and cash flow projections for all segments decreased substantially as the economy worsened our me segment was the only segment which had a fair value that fell below the carrying value of its net assets 

  

should our revenue and cash flow projections decline significantly in the future additional impairment charges may be recorded to goodwill as of january 31 2010 a hypothetical 10 decrease in the fair value of our reporting units would not have an impact on the carrying value of goodwill nor result in impairment of goodwill see note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

interest and other income net 

the following table sets forth the components of interest and other income net 

 

 interest and investment income net fluctuates based on average cash and marketable securities balances average maturities and interest rates the increase in interest and other income net during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 is primarily due to gains on marketable securities gains on foreign currency transactions a gain on the sale of an investment and the impairment of an investment during fiscal 2009 these increases were partially offset by lower interest rate yields on investments during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 the decrease in interest and investment income net during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 is primarily due to lower interest rate yields 

provision for income taxes 

we account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse 

our effective tax rate was 32 and 27 during fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively our effective tax rate increased 5 from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 primarily due to a change in expected future tax rates and the establishment of the california valuation allowance in fiscal 2010 offset by nondeductible goodwill impairment and inprocess research and development expenses in fiscal 2009 during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 the state of california enacted legislation significantly altering california tax law as a result of the newly enacted legislation we expect that in fiscal years 2012 and beyond income subject to tax in california will be less than under prior tax law and accordingly deferred tax assets are less likely to be realized 

our effective tax rate was 27 and 24 during fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively our effective tax rate increased 3 from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 primarily due to nondeductible goodwill impairment and inprocess research and development expenses 

our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate research credits state income taxes the tax impact of stockbased compensation accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations us manufacturer’s deduction closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits changes in valuation allowances and changes in tax law 

  

at january 31 2010 we had net deferred tax assets of 1461 million we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize these assets 

for additional information regarding our income tax provision see note 5 “income taxes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of cash is from the sale of licenses to our products our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employeerelated expenses such as compensation and benefits as well as general operating expenses for marketing facilities and overhead costs in addition to operating expenses we also use cash to invest in our growth initiatives which include acquisitions of products technology and businesses and to fund our stock repurchase program see further discussion of these items below 

at january 31 2010 our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 11262 million and net accounts receivable of 2774 in addition we have a us line of credit facility that permits unsecured shortterm borrowings of up to 2500 million and a china line of credit that permits unsecured shortterm borrowings of up to 50 million these line of credit agreements contain customary covenants that could restrict the imposition of liens on our assets and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or make dispositions of assets if we fail to maintain their financial covenants these credit facilities are available for working capital and other business needs at january 31 2010 we had no borrowings outstanding on the us or china line of credit the us facility expires in august 2012 and the china facility has no contractual expiration as of march 19 2010 no amounts were outstanding on the us and china line of credit facilities 

our cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally our primary commercial banking relationship is with citibank and its global affiliates “citibank” in addition citicorp usa inc an affiliate of citibank is the lead lender and agent in the syndicate of our 2500 million us line of credit 

the increase in our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities from 9887 million at january 31 2009 to 11262 million at january 31 2010 is principally the result of cash generated from operations and the proceeds from the issuance of common stock these increases to cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were partially offset by cash used for repurchases of our common stock repayment of our lines of credit capital expenditures the acquisition of planplatform and equity investments cash generated from operations was negatively impacted by lower net revenue and the payment of restructuring charges 

at january 31 2010 our shortterm investment portfolio had an estimated fair value of 1619 million and a cost basis of 1691 million the portfolio fair value consisted of 890 million invested in commercial paper and corporate securities 263 million invested in mutual funds 246 million invested in certificates of deposit and time deposits with remaining maturities at the date of purchase greater than 90 days and less than one year 100 million invested in money market funds 88 million invested in us government agency securities and 32 million invested in municipal securities and other securities 

at january 31 2010 we had an investment in the reserve international liquidity fund the “international fund” a market fund with an estimated fair value of 100 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 the international fund ceased redemptions after net asset values of the funds decreased below 1 per share this occurred as a result of the international fund revaluing its holdings of debt securities issued by lehman brothers which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on september 15 2008 and the resulting unusually high redemption requests on the international fund our investment in the international fund is unrelated to the assets of our deferred compensation plan 

  

a third party court appointed supervisor is overseeing but not managing the accounting and payment administration of the non usbased international fund our investment in the international fund is not currently liquid and in the event we need to access these funds we will not be able to do so however based on currently available information we expect to recover substantially all of our current holdings net of reserves from the international fund within the next 12 months accordingly the investment in the international fund is classified in current “marketable securities” in the consolidated balance sheets 

in addition at january 31 2010 we owned two auction rate securities with an estimated fair value of 76 million our auction rate securities are variable rate debt instruments that have underlying securities with contractual maturities greater than ten years and interest rates that were structured to reset at auction every 28 days the securities which met our investment guidelines at the time the investments were made have failed to settle in auctions since august 2007 and have earned a premium interest rate since that time while we expect to recover substantially all of our current holdings net of reserves in the auction rate securities we cannot predict when this will occur or the amount we will receive due to the lack of liquidity of these investments they are included in noncurrent “marketable securities” in the consolidated balance sheets see note 2 “financial instruments and hedging activities” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our financial instruments 

at january 31 2010 263 million of trading securities were invested in a defined set of mutual funds as directed by the participants in our deferred compensation plan see note 6 “deferred compensation” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

the primary source for net cash provided by operating activities of 2468 million for fiscal 2010 was net income increased by the effect of noncash expenses associated with depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation and impairment of goodwill the primary working capital source of cash was a decrease in accounts receivable the decrease in accounts receivable relates primarily to the increase in collections during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 our days sales outstanding in trade receivables was 55 days at january 31 2010 the primary working capital uses of cash were for payment of restructuringrelated costs the reduction of deferred revenue due to lower maintenance billings for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 and reductions of accrued expenses primarily related to our fiscal 2010 employee bonus accrual and fourth quarter fiscal 2010 commissions we expect net cash flows provided by operating activities to be higher in fiscal 2011 than in fiscal 2010 due to improved operating margins 

longterm cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following stock repurchases the acquisition of businesses software products or technologies complementary to our business capital expenditures including the purchase and implementation of internaluse software applications and funding restructuring costs 

our existing cash cash equivalents and investment balances may decline in fiscal 2011 in the event of a further weakening of the economy or changes in our planned cash outlay cash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the risks detailed in part i item 1a titled “risk factors” however based on our current business plan and revenue prospects we believe that our existing balances our anticipated cash flows from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next 12 months our existing us credit facility is currently 2500 million of which we have no amounts outstanding this credit facility is available for working capital and other business needs 

our revenue earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our risk management strategy utilizes derivative instruments to hedge a majority of our foreign currency transaction exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations as of january 31 2010 we have open contracts to hedge expected cash flows for one to twelve months in the future contracts are primarily denominated in euros japanese yen swiss francs british pounds and canadian dollars we do not enter into any 

  

derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes the notional amount of our option and forward contracts was 2391 million and 2767 million at january 31 2010 and january 31 2009 respectively 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at january 31 2010 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 

 

  

  operating lease obligations consist primarily of obligations for facilities net of sublease income computer equipment and other equipment leases 

purchase obligations are contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on autodesk and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligations relate primarily to hosting services agreements it infrastructure costs marketing costs and contractual software development services 

deferred compensation obligations relate to amounts held in a rabbi trust under our nonqualified deferred compensation plan see note 6 “deferred compensation” in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding this plan 

pension obligations relate to our obligations for pension plans outside of the us see note 15 “retirement benefit plans” in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these obligations 

restructuring obligations relate to our fiscal 2010 2009 and other restructuring plans see note 16 “restructuring reserves” in our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our restructuring plans 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies or 

  

other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months in addition we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products royalty expense is generally based on the number of units shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue royalty expense included in cost of license and other revenue was 165 million in fiscal 2010 171 million in fiscal 2009 and 149 million in fiscal 2008 

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees including limited product warranties historically costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant but because potential future costs are highly variable we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations 

issuer purchases of equity securities 

our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the cumulative repurchase of up to 1640 million shares the purpose of the stock repurchase program is to help offset the dilution to net income per share caused by the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders the number of shares acquired and the timing of the purchases are based on several factors including general market conditions the volume of employee stock option exercises the trading price of our common stock cash on hand and available in the us and company defined trading windows there were 10 million repurchases of our common stock during the three months ended january 31 2010 during the year ended january 31 2010 we repurchased 27 million shares of our common stock at january 31 2010 135 million shares remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization this program does not have a fixed expiration date see note 9 “stockholder’ equity” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than operating leases we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing arrangements or have any variableinterest entities as of january 31 2010 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend foreign currency exchange risk 

our revenue earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency contracts to manage our foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations as of january 31 2010 and 2009 we had open contracts to hedge expected cash flows for one to 12 months in the future in order to reduce our exposure to foreign currency volatility contracts were primarily denominated in euros japanese yen swiss francs british pounds and canadian dollars we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes the notional amount of our option and forward contracts was 2391 million and 2767 million at january 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

we utilize foreign currency contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue and operating expenses of certain anticipated transactions a sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january 31 2010 indicated that a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 31 2010 would increase the fair value of our contracts by 242 million a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the 

  

dollar from its value at january 31 2010 would decrease the fair value of our contracts by 131 million we do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows as a result of these foreign currency contracts 

interest rate risk 

interest rate movements affect both the interest income we earn on our short term investments and to a lesser extent the market value of certain longer term securities at january 31 2010 we had 9100 million of cash equivalents and marketable securities with an average investment balance for the quarter of approximately 7428 million if interest rates were to increase decrease by 10 this would result in a 01 million increase decrease in annual interest income further at january 31 2010 we had approximately 1256 million invested in a longer term portfolio which with 50 and 100 basis point moves would result in market value changes gains or losses of 02 million over both six and 12 month periods we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk

our management evaluated with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 i is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and ii is accumulated and communicated to autodesk’s management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting as such term is defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended during the quarter ended january 31 2010 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2010 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal control—integrated framework  our management has concluded that as of january 31 2010 our internal control over financial reporting is effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting which is included in item 8 herein 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within autodesk have been detected

product development and introduction 

we continue to enhance our product offerings and develop new products to meet changing customer demands research and development expenditures were 5761 million or 25 of fiscal 2009 net revenue 4905 million or 23 of fiscal 2008 net revenue and 4106 million or 22 of fiscal 2007 net revenue our software is primarily developed internally however we do contract services from software development firms consultants and independent contractors to supplement our development efforts additionally we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing or licensing some or all of the assets or stock of the entity that owns rights to the products or technology 

the majority of our basic research and product development is performed in the united states china singapore and canada translation and localization of our products is performed in a number of local markets 

  

principally in singapore and switzerland we generally localize and translate our products into german french italian spanish russian japanese korean and simplified and traditional chinese 

we employ experienced software developers we also use independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities we plan to continue to manage significant product development operations internationally over the next several years we believe that our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize product development lower costs and integrate local market knowledge into our development activities we continually assess the significant costs and challenges including intellectual property protection against the benefits of our international development activities 

in addition our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with a network of over 3400 thirdparty developers who develop and sell their own products that further enhance the range of integrated solutions available to our customers 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware operating systems and software in addition our customer’s requirements and preferences rapidly evolve as do their expectations of our software to keep pace with these changes we maintain an aggressive program of new product development to address demands in the marketplace for our products we dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to further enhance our existing products and to create new products and technologies we continually review these investments in an effort to ensure that we are generating sufficient revenue or gaining a competitive advantage to justify their costs for further discussion regarding risks from our product development and introduction efforts see item 1a “risk factors” 

marketing and sales 

we license or sell our products and services globally primarily through indirect channels consisting of distributors and resellers to a lesser extent we also transact directly with customers who are primarily large corporations our indirect channel model includes both a twotiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a onetiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers we have a network of approximately 1700 resellers and distributors worldwide for fiscal 2009 approximately 86 of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the future we employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our reseller channel with our business strategy sales through one distributor tech data corporation and its affiliates accounted for 14 14 and 12 of our net revenue for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively no other distributor or reseller accounted for 10 or more of our revenue 

our customerrelated operations are divided into three geographic regions the americas europemiddle eastafrica emea and asia pacific and are supported by global marketing and sales organizations these organizations develop and manage overall marketing and sales programs and work closely with a network of domestic and international sales offices fiscal 2009 net revenue in the americas emea and asia pacific regions was 7823 million 10034 million and 5295 million respectively 

we also work directly with reseller and distributor sales organizations computer manufacturers other software developers and peripherals manufacturers in cooperative advertising promotions and tradeshow presentations we employ massmarketing techniques such as web casts seminars telemarketing direct mailings and advertising in business and trade journals we have a worldwide user group organization and we have created online user communities dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products 

in addition to sales of new software licenses we generate revenue through our maintenance program and upgrade program these programs are available for a majority of our products and offer our customers two alternative means of migrating to the most recent version of our products 

  

under the maintenance program known by our user community as the autodesk subscription program customers who own a perpetual use license for the most recent version of the underlying product are able to purchase maintenance that provides them with unspecified upgrades whenandifavailable and are able to download elearning courses and receive online support over a one year or multiyear maintenance service period revenue from our maintenance program is reported separately on our consolidated statements of income and is referred to throughout this document as maintenance revenue 

the autodesk upgrade program allows customers who are not on the maintenance program to purchase upgrades but only to the extent that they are still on an autodesksupported version of the product typically the cost to upgrade is based on a multiple of the number of versions the customer is upgrading an existing customer also has the option to upgrade for a premium fee to a different industryspecific or 3d product which generally has a higher price we refer to this as a crossgrade the cost of a crossgrade is substantially less than the cost of purchasing a new license and is available to maintenance customers as well revenue from our upgrade and crossgrade programs is reported on our consolidated statements of income in “license and other” our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller networks computer software resellers and distributors are typically not highly capitalized as a result they have historically experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and are experiencing difficulties in the current economic environment while we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of resellers and distributors prior to selling to them if their financial condition were to deteriorate further they might not be able to make repeat purchases the loss of or a significant reduction in business with any one of our major international distributors or large resellers could harm our business our reliance on distributors and resellers subjects us to other risks see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

we intend to continue to make our products available in foreign languages we believe that international sales will continue to comprise the majority of our net revenue economic weakness in countries where we generate a significant portion of our net revenue including the us has had and could in the future have an adverse effect on our business a summary of our financial information by geographic location is found in note 11 “segments” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

customer and reseller support 

we provide technical support and training to customers through a leveraged support model augmented by direct programs designed to address certain specific needs our customers rely primarily on the resellers and distributors from which they purchased licenses to our products for technical support however we do provide certain direct support for some of our customers we support our resellers and distributors through technical product training sales training classes the internet and telephone we also provide online support directly to our customers through our maintenance program there are also a number of user group forums in which customers are able to share information 

educational programs 

we offer education programs and specially priced software purchasing options tailored for educational institutions students and faculty to train the next generation of users we also offer classroom support including standardized curricula developed by educators instructor development and a rich assortment of online learning resources users trained on our products are broadly available both from educational institutions and the existing workforce reducing the cost of training for our customers 

developer programs 

one of our key strategies is to maintain an openarchitecture design of our software products to facilitate thirdparty development of complementary products and industryspecific software solutions this approach enables customers and third parties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses we offer several programs that provide marketing sales technical support and programming tools to developers who 

  

develop addon applications for our products over 3300 developers in the autodesk developer network create interoperable products that further enhance the range of integrated solutions available to our customers 

backlog 

we typically ship products shortly after receipt of an order which is common in the software industry our aggregate backlog is primarily comprised of deferred revenue deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred maintenance revenue from our maintenance program to a lesser extent deferred revenue consists of deferred license and other revenue derived from collaborative project management services consulting services and deferred license sales backlog also includes current software license product orders which have not yet shipped the category of current software license product orders which we have not yet shipped consists of orders from customers with approved credit status for currently available license software products and may include both orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period 

aggregate backlog was 5695 million at january 31 2009 of which 5521 million was deferred revenue and 174 million related to current software license product orders which had not yet shipped at the end of the fiscal year aggregate backlog was 5215 million at january 31 2008 of which 5061 million was deferred revenue and 154 million related to current software license product orders which had not yet shipped at the end of the fiscal year deferred revenue increased over the prior year primarily due to an increase in deferred maintenance revenue we do not believe that aggregate backlog as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of future results 

competition 

the markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to rapid change we strive to increase our competitive separation by investing in research and development allowing us to bring new products to market and create exciting new versions of existing products that offer compelling efficiencies for our customers we also compete through investments in marketing and sales 

our pseb aec and msd segments compete with vendors that specialize primarily in one of the three industry segments in which we compete our competitors range from large global publicly traded companies to small geographically focused firms our primary global competitors in these segments include adobe systems incorporated bentley systems incorporated dassault systèmes sa and its subsidiary solidworks corporation environmental systems research institute inc esri google inc intergraph corporation nemetschek ag parametric technology corporation and siemens ag plm software division 

our me segment competes with a wide range of different companies from large global publiclytraded companies to small private entities large organizations that produce products that compete in some or all of our markets include adobe systems incorporated apple inc avid technology inc sony corporation and thomson the media and entertainment market is highly fragmented with complex interdependencies between many of the larger corporations as a result some of our competitors also own subsidiaries that are our customers or our partners in developing or bringing to market some of our solutions 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing power with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the design software market is characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete both from existing competitors and by entry of competitors with innovative technologies competition is increasingly enhanced by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources than we do see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion of risks regarding competition 

  

because of these and other factors competitive conditions in these industries are likely to continue to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which could harm our business furthermore in certain markets some of our competitors have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources 

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our abilities to offer new products whether by internal development or acquisition and to continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to ease of use reliability performance range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation price and training 

intellectual property and licenses 

we maintain an active program to legally protect our investment in technology through intellectual property rights we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent copyright trademark and trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions the nature and extent of legal protection associated with each such intellectual property right depends on among other things the type of intellectual property right and the given jurisdiction in which such right arises we believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business including each of our segments 

nonetheless our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws enforcement of intellectual property rights against alleged infringers can sometimes lead to costly litigation and counterclaims our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business 

from time to time we receive claims alleging infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights including patents disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to among other things costly litigation or product shipment delays which could harm our business 

we retain ownership of software we develop all software is licensed to users and provided in object code pursuant to either shrinkwrap embedded or online licenses or signed license agreements these agreements contain restrictions on duplication disclosure and transfer 

we believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our intellectual property and the rapid ongoing technological changes in both the computer hardware and software industries we must rely principally upon software engineering and marketing skills to maintain and enhance our competitive market position 

while we have recovered some revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the full extent to which piracy of our software products exists we believe however that software piracy is and can be expected to be a persistent problem that negatively impacts our revenue 

in addition through various licensing arrangements we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others we expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing arrangements in the future as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions to support continued development and sales of our products and services some of these licensing arrangements require or may require royalty payments and other licensing fees the amount of these payments and fees may depend on various factors including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments offsetting considerations if any and the degree of use of the licensed technology 

see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion of risks related to protecting our intellectual property 

  

production and suppliers 

production of our pseb aec msd and certain me software products involves duplication of the software media and for certain products the printing of user manuals the purchase of media and the transfer of the software programs onto media for distribution to customers are performed by us and by licensed subcontractors media for our products include dvds which are available from multiple sources for certain of our products user manuals are made available by request only as we work toward reducing our cost of shipping and production user manuals and packaging materials are produced to our specifications by outside sources production is either performed in leased facilities operated by us or by independent thirdparty contractors to date we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the production of our software and documentation 

employees 

as of january 31 2009 we employed approximately 7800 people in january 2009 we announced a restructuring plan to reduce annual operating expenses as part of that plan we expect to reduce our workforce by approximately 750 employees representing approximately 10 percent of our global workforce however approximately 650 of the total 750 employees impacted by the restructuring plan are considered to be employed as of january 31 2009 and are included in the total employee count above none of our employees in the united states are represented by a labor union however in certain foreign countries our employees are represented by work councils we have never experienced any work stoppages and believe our employee relations are good reliance upon employees in other countries entails various risks that possible government instability or regulation unfavorable to foreignowned businesses could negatively impact our business in the future 

even in weak economic conditions recruiting highly skilled engineers in the software industry is competitive and difficult we believe our future success is highly dependent on our continued ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees

 item 1a risk factors tableend we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks many of which are beyond our control in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following discussion highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on future results of operations if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted causing the trading price of our common stock to decline in addition these risks and uncertainties may impact the “forwardlooking” statements described elsewhere in this form 10k and in the documents incorporated herein by reference they could affect our actual results of operations causing them to differ materially from those expressed in “forwardlooking” statements 

the deteriorating global economic conditions may further affect our financial results additionally harming our business 

as our business has expanded globally we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic and political conditions global economic conditions have deteriorated over the past several quarters particularly during our most recent fiscal quarter that ended on january 31 2009 this has led to our customers deferring reducing or cancelling purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news these factors have negatively impacted our business and our financial results 

if global economic conditions continue to deteriorate or our customers continue to perceive uncertainty in global economic conditions many of our customers may further delay reduce or cancel their technology purchases this could result in further reductions in sales of our products longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition 

in addition continued weakness in the enduser market could further negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could in turn delay paying their obligations to us which would increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue on future sales to these customers 

these actions have and may continue to negatively impact our business financial results and financial condition in addition the negative effect these factors have had on our cash flows has caused us to take an impairment charge on some of our longterm assets and may cause us to take additional impairment charges in the future 

the actions that we are taking in response to the global economic slowdown and our related business slowdown may be costly and may not be as effective as anticipated 

we are taking actions to reduce our cost structure to more closely align our costs with our revenue levels in taking these actions we are attempting to balance the cost of such initiatives against the longer term benefit of such initiatives in taking these actions we will incur additional costs in the short term that may have the effect of reducing our operating margins if we do not achieve the proper balance of these cost reduction initiatives we may eliminate critical elements of our operations the loss of which could negatively impact our ability to benefit from an economic recovery we cannot assure that our cost cutting efforts will achieve appropriate levels of expenses and we may take additional actions in the future 

in addition we are taking actions to stimulate demand through a number of programs although we are attempting to balance the cost of these programs against the longer term benefits it is possible that we will make such investments without a corresponding increase in demand for our products this would further reduce our operating margins and have a negative impact on our financial results 

the recent global credit and banking crisis may further negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the recent global financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets and the going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets a 

  

low level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in many financial instrument markets our business has been impacted by these events and may be further impacted from this global credit and banking crisis by the insolvency of key channel partners impairing our distribution channels counterparty failures negatively impacting our treasury functions including timely access to our cash reserves and increased expense or inability to obtain shortterm financing if banks providing our line of credit are unable to lend us money when it is needed for our operations 

net revenue or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline 

the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including shortfalls in our expected net revenue earnings or key performance metrics changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors quarterly variations in our or our competitors’ results of operations developments in our industry unusual events such as significant acquisitions divestitures and litigation and general socioeconomic political or market conditions and other factors including factors unrelated to our operating performance like the current credit issues affecting the economy or the operating performance of our competitors for example current deteriorating global economic conditions have negatively impacted our financial performance and in turn the market price of our common stock 

significant changes in the price of our common stock could expose us to additional costly and timeconsuming litigation historically after periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities a company becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management’s attention and resources 

a significant portion of our revenue is generated through maintenance revenue any decrease in maintenance attach and renewal rates or a decrease in the number of new seats we sell would negatively impact our future revenue and operating results 

our maintenance customers have no obligation to attach maintenance to their initial license or renew their maintenance contract after the expiration of their initial maintenance period which is typically one year our customers’ attach and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors if our customers do not attach maintenance to their initial license or renew their maintenance contract for our products then our maintenance revenue will decline and our business will suffer in addition a portion of the growth of our maintenance revenue has typically been associated with growth of the number of licenses that we sell any reduction in the number of licenses that we sell even if our customers’ attach rates do not change will have a negative impact on our future maintenance revenue this in turn would impact our business and harm our financial results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the us and we make certain business and resource decisions based on assumptions about foreign currency we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 

we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our earnings exposure and cash flow exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as part of our risk management strategy we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage a portion of our exposures of underlying assets liabilities and 

  

other obligations which exist as part of our ongoing business operations these foreign currency instruments have maturities that extend for one to 12 months in the future and provide us with some protection against currency exposures our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our financial results 

during the first three quarters of fiscal year 2009 we benefited from the us dollar’s weakness against other currencies since such depreciation has increased the revenue we report however during the last quarter of fiscal year 2009 the us dollar strengthened as compared to other currencies negatively impacting our revenue if the us dollar continues to strengthen our future net revenue could be further harmed although we have expanded our foreign currency cash flow hedge program beyond the current quarter to a longer term program in order to reduce foreign currency volatility we cannot completely mitigate this risk and in any case will incur transaction fees in adopting such hedging programs 

if we do not maintain our relationships with the members of our distribution channel or achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected if our distribution channel suffers financial losses or becomes financially unstable or insolvent our ability to generate revenue will be adversely affected 

we sell our software products both directly to endusers and through a network of distributors and resellers for fiscal 2009 approximately 86 of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the future our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller network computer software distributors and resellers typically are not highly capitalized have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and are experiencing difficulties in the current economic environment we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of distributors and resellers prior to our sales to them in the past we have taken steps to support them and may take additional steps in the future such as extending credit terms and providing temporary discounts which could harm our operating results if our distributors and resellers were to become insolvent their inability to maintain their business and sales would negatively impact our business and revenue we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including distributors tech data corporation and its global affiliates “tech data” tech data accounted for 14 and 14 of our consolidated net revenue for the fiscal years ended january 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

over time we have modified and will continue to modify aspects of our relationship with our distributors and resellers such as their incentive programs pricing to them and our distribution model to motivate and reward them for aligning their businesses with our strategy and business objectives changes in these relationships and underlying programs could negatively impact their business and harm our business in addition the loss of or a significant reduction in business with those distributors or resellers or the failure to achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough with any one of our major international distributors or large resellers could harm our business in particular if one or more of such distributors or resellers were unable to meet their obligations with respect to accounts payable to us we could be forced to write off such accounts and may be required to delay the recognition of revenue on future sales to these customers which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period 

our investment portfolio is composed of a variety of investment vehicles in a number of countries that are subject to interest rate trends market volatility and other economic factors if general economic conditions continue to create a decline in interest rates deterioration in the credit rating of our investments or illiquidity in the financial marketplace we may continue to experience a decline in interest income an inability to sell our investments or impairment in the value of our investments 

it is our policy to invest our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities with and in the custody of financial institutions with high credit ratings and to limit the amounts invested with any one institution type of 

  

security and issuer however we are subject to general economic conditions interest rate trends and volatility in the financial marketplace that can affect the income that we receive from our investments the net realizable value of our investments including our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities and our ability to sell them in the us for example if the federal reserve continues to lower interest rates the yields on our portfolio securities may further decline any one of these factors could reduce our interest income or result in material charges which in turn could impact our overall net income and earnings per share 

for example during fiscal year 2009 we recorded several otherthantemporary impairment charges to recognize the estimated loss in these investments these charges impacted our overall net income and earnings per share 

a further description of our capital resources can be found in the liquidity and capital resources section of item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” 

our efforts to develop and introduce new product and service offerings including new product features expose us to risks such as limited customer acceptance costs related to product defects and large expenditures that may not result in additional net revenue 

rapid technological changes as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences characterize the software industry we are devoting significant resources to the development of technologies like our vertical design products and our digital prototyping and collaboration products in addition we are continually introducing new business models that require a considerable investment of technical and financial resources we are making such investments through further development and enhancement of our existing products as well as through acquisitions of new product lines such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs or competitors may introduce new products and services that achieve acceptance among our current customers adversely affecting our competitive position in particular a critical component of our growth strategy is to have customers of our autocad and autocad lt products expand their portfolios to include our related 2d vertical industry products and our 3d modelbased design products such as our autodesk inventor products our autodesk revit products our autocad civil 3d products and our autodesk navisworks products should sales of our autocad and autocad lt products decrease without a corresponding increase in 2d vertical and 3d modelbased design product revenue or without purchases of customer seats to our 2d vertical products and 3d modelbased design products our results of operations will be adversely affected 

additionally the software products we offer are complex and despite extensive testing and quality control may contain errors or defects these defects or errors could result in the need for corrective releases to our software products damage to our reputation loss of revenue an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products any of which would likely harm our business 

our business could suffer as a result of risks and costs associated with strategic acquisitions and investments 

we regularly acquire or invest in businesses software products and technologies that are complementary to our business through strategic alliances equity investments or acquisitions the risks associated with such acquisitions include among others the difficulty of assimilating the products operations and personnel of the companies the failure to realize anticipated revenue and cost projections the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business in accordance with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “section 404” and the diversion of management’s time and attention in addition such acquisitions and investments may involve significant transaction or integrationrelated costs we may not be successful in overcoming such risks and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business in addition such acquisitions and investments have in the past and may in the future contribute to potential fluctuations in quarterly results of operations the fluctuations could arise from transactionrelated costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or writeoffs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments for example during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we took an impairment 

  

charge of 1289 million primarily related to goodwill associated with acquisitions in our me segment we also may need to make further investments to support these acquired companies and may have difficulty identifying and acquiring appropriate resources these costs or charges could negatively impact results of operations for a given period cause quarter to quarter variability in our operating results or negatively impact our operating results for several future periods 

our operating results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenue and operating results difficult to predict 

our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include general global economic conditions the timing of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors lower growth or contraction of our upgrade or maintenance programs stockbased compensation expense fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the financial and business condition of our reseller and distribution channels failure to achieve anticipated levels of customer acceptance of key new applications failure to follow sales policies unexpected costs or other operating expenses changes in product pricing or product mix platform changes failure to expand our autocad and autocad lt products customer base to related 2d vertical industry and 3d modelbased design products timing of product releases and retirements failure to continue momentum of frequent release cycles or to move a significant number of customers from prior product versions in connection with our programs to retire major products failure to accurately predict the impact of acquired businesses failure to successfully or fully integrate acquired businesses and technologies unexpected outcomes of matters relating to litigation failure to achieve continued cost reductions and productivity increases unanticipated changes in tax rates and tax laws distribution channel management changes in sales compensation practices the timing of large sales failure to effectively implement our copyright legalization programs especially in developing countries failure to achieve sufficient sellthrough in our channels for new or existing products renegotiation or termination of royalty or intellectual property arrangements interruptions or terminations in the business of our consultants or third party developers failure to grow lifecycle management or collaboration products and unanticipated impact of accounting for technology acquisitions 

we have also experienced fluctuations in operating results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic conditions in particular our operating results in europe during our third quarter are usually affected by a slow summer period and our asia pacific operations typically experience seasonal slowing in our third and fourth quarters 

our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenue and are relatively fixed in the short term accordingly any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability greater than anticipated expenses or a failure to maintain rigorous cost controls would also negatively affect profitability further gross margins may be adversely affected if our sales of autocad lt upgrades and advanced systems products which historically have had lower margins grow at a faster rate than sales of our highermargin products 

because we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from autocadbased software products if these products are not successful our net revenue will be adversely affected 

we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from sales of licenses of autocad software including products based on autocad that serve specific vertical markets upgrades to those products and products that are interoperable with autocad as such any factor adversely affecting sales of these products including the product release cycle market acceptance product competition performance and reliability reputation price competition economic and market conditions and the availability of thirdparty applications would likely harm our operating results 

  

we are dependent on international revenue and operations exposing us to significant regulatory global economic intellectual property collections currency exchange rate taxation and other risks which could adversely impact our financial results 

we are dependent on our international operations for a significant portion of our revenue our international revenue including that from emerging economies is subject to general economic and political conditions in foreign markets including conditions in foreign markets resulting from economic and political conditions in the us these factors have recently adversely impacted and may in the future continue to adversely impact our future international revenue and consequently our business as a whole further our dependency on international revenue makes us much more exposed to global economic trends which can negatively impact our financial results even if our results in the us are strong for a particular period 

in addition we anticipate that our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue and as we expand our international development sales and marketing expertise will provide significant support to our overall efforts in countries outside of the us risks inherent in our international operations include fluctuating currency exchange rates including risks related to any hedging activities we undertake unexpected changes in regulatory requirements practices and tariffs difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales and development operations longer collection cycles for accounts receivable potential changes in tax laws tax arrangements with foreign governments and laws regarding the management of data possible future limitations upon foreign owned businesses and greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property 

we have been named as a party in lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices and related accounting and we may be named in additional litigation in the future all of which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price for our securities 

we are currently defending two lawsuits that have been filed against us and our current officers and certain of our current and former directors and officers relating to our historical stock option practices and related accounting see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of these proceedings the ultimate outcomes of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price for our securities 

we may become the subject of additional private or government actions in the future including stockholder or employee litigation litigation may be timeconsuming expensive and disruptive to normal business operations and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict the defense of lawsuits may result in significant expenditures and the diversion of our management’s time and attention from the operation of our business which could impede our business all or a portion of any amount we may be required to pay to satisfy a judgment or settlement of any claims may not be covered by insurance 

our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our success depends largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical professional managerial sales and marketing personnel historically competition for these personnel has been intense for example over the past several quarters we have been actively recruiting a new chief financial officer the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions and financial goals 

existing and increased competition may reduce our net revenue and profits 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of desktop computers with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the 

  

markets in which we compete are characterized by vigorous competition both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources furthermore a reduction in the number and availability of compatible thirdparty applications may adversely affect the sale of our products because of these and other factors competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future increased competition could result in continued price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which would likely harm our business 

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer products that compete favorably with respect to reliability performance ease of use range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation and price 

if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights our business could be harmed 

we rely on a combination of patent copyright and trademark laws trade secret protections confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software products or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our software products is timeconsuming and costly while we have recovered some revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists and software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem furthermore our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 

as more software patents are granted worldwide as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grow and as the functionality of products in different industry segments overlap we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims infringement or misappropriation claims have in the past been and may in the future be asserted against us and any such assertions could harm our business additionally certain patent holders without products have become more aggressive in threatening and pursuing litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents any such claims or threats whether with or without merit have been and could in the future be timeconsuming to defend result in costly litigation and diversion of resources or could cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in addition such royalty or license agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms if at all which would likely harm our business 

while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to section 404 we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting the report contains among other matters an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 

while we have determined in our management report on internal control over financial reporting included in this annual report on form 10k that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 31 2009 we must continue to monitor and assess our internal control over financial reporting if our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and such weakness remains uncorrected at fiscal year end we will be unable to assert such internal control is effective at 

  

fiscal year end if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective at fiscal yearend or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or concludes that we have a material weakness in our internal controls we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which would likely have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 

in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions judgments and estimates about our accruals which if not accurate may significantly impact our financial results 

we make accruals for a number of items including employee bonuses partner incentive programs product returns reserve sales commissions sabbatical asset retirement obligations and allowance for doubtful accounts these accruals are based on assumptions judgments and estimates drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances when made actual results could differ materially from our estimated accruals and such differences could significantly impact our financial results 

changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business further such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective for example effective as of february 1 2009 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” “sfas 141r” which requires acquisitionrelated costs to be expensed as incurred restructuring costs generally to be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date inprocess research and development to be capitalized as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period which will impact income tax expense the impact that sfas 141r has on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows will be dependent on the number and size of business combinations that the company consummates subsequent to the adoption of the standard as well as the valuation and allocation of the net assets acquired 

our operating results could be negatively impacted if our tax positions are successfully challenged by tax authorities 

we are a usbased multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions our effective tax rate is based on expected geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany transfer pricing and enacted tax rules significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis we believe our tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 

we rely on third party technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies our product and service development may be delayed 

we rely on certain software that we license from third parties including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions these thirdparty software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and the software may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software can be developed identified licensed and integrated which would likely harm our business 

  

we regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems disrupt our operations our business could be harmed 

we rely on our network and data center infrastructure internal technology systems and our websites for our development marketing operational support and sales activities we are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet the growing requirements of our business and customers such improvements are often complex costly and time consuming in addition such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems or uncover problems with our existing technology systems unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in disruption in our business operations loss of revenue or damage to our reputation 

disruptions with licensing relationships and third party developers could adversely impact our business 

we license certain key technologies from third parties licenses may be restricted in the term or the use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business similarly we may not be able to obtain or renew license agreements for key technology on favorable terms if at all and any failure to do so could harm our business 

our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with thirdparty developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn in particular markets such disruption would likely negatively impact these thirdparty developers and end users which could harm our business 

additionally technology created by outsourced product development whether outsourced to third parties or developed externally and transferred to us through business or technology acquisitions have certain additional risks these risks include potential difficulties with effective integration into existing products adequate transfer of technology knowhow and ownership and protection of transferred intellectual property 

as a result of our strategy of partnering with other companies for product development our product delivery schedules could be adversely affected if we experience difficulties with our product development partners 

we partner with certain independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities we believe our partnering strategy allows us to among other things achieve efficiencies in developing new products and maintaining and enhancing existing product offerings our partnering strategy creates a dependency on such independent developers independent developers including those who currently develop products for us in the us and throughout the world may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future in addition use of development resources through consulting relationships particularly in nonus jurisdictions with developing legal systems may be adversely impacted by and expose us to risks relating to evolving employment export and intellectual property laws these risks could among other things expose our intellectual property to misappropriation and result in disruptions to product delivery schedules

strategy 

our goal is to be the world’s leading 2d and 3d design and engineering software and services company for the architecture engineering and construction manufacturing geospatial mapping and digital media and entertainment markets worldwide business trends such as globalization sustainability investment in infrastructure and the increasing desire to keep data digital are creating pressure on our customers to improve innovation while enhancing productivity we offer our customers the ability to visualize and simulate realworld performance early in the design process through digital prototyping to foster innovation enhance quality and save time and money for competitive advantage our customers are seeking differentiation through design and we believe our products provide a competitive advantage to succeed in this environment 

we believe that our ability to make technology available to mainstream markets is one of our competitive advantages by innovating in existing technology categories we bring powerful design products to volume markets our products are designed to be easy to learn and use and to provide customers low cost of deployment low total cost of ownership and a rapid return on investment in addition our software architecture allows for extensibility and integration with other products we believe that our technological leadership brand recognition breadth of product line and large installed base will help us weather the economic storm and position us well for an eventual recovery 

we have created a large global community of distributors and resellers thirdparty developers and customers these relationships provide us with a broad reach into volume markets our distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with global resources for the purchase and support of our products as well as resources for effective and cost efficient training services we believe the strength of our channel will help us maintain our leadership throughout the economic downturn the overall health of our channel partners remains vitally important to us we have an active partner assistance program in place on a global basis and we will continue to work closely with our partners in a collaborative effort to fight through the current economic downturn we have a significant number of registered thirdparty developers that create products that operate with our software products further extending our reach into volume markets users trained on our products are broadly available both from educational institutions and the existing work force reducing the cost of training for our customers to train the next generation of users we offer education programs including classroom support standardized curricula instructor development and specially priced softwarepurchasing options 

  

our growth strategy derives from these core strengths we continue to increase the business value of our design tools in a number of ways we improve the performance and functionality of existing products with each new release our most recent product release commenced in march 2009 beyond our 2d horizontal design products we develop products addressing industryspecific needs including 2d vertical and 3d modelbased products we continually strive to improve our product functionality and specialization by industry while increasing product interoperability and usability we are also considering innovative ways of delivering better user experiences to the customers we serve as a result we drive technology democratization and increase customer loyalty 

in addition we believe that expanding our 2d horizontal product customers’ portfolios to include our 2d vertical products and 3d modelbased design products presents a meaningful growth opportunity and is an important part of our overall strategy for fiscal 2009 revenue from 3d modelbased design products increased 23 including a 38 increase in related maintenance revenue as compared to the prior fiscal year we shipped approximately 142000 commercial seats which includes new seats and crossgrade seats of 3d modelbased design products including approximately 37000 seats of autodesk inventor and autodesk moldflow and approximately 105000 seats of our architecture engineering and construction products autodesk revit autocad civil 3d autodesk navisworks and autodesk robobat we expect that the adoption of 2d vertical products and 3d modelbased design products will increase the productivity of our customers in all industries and result in richer design data this migration also poses various risks to us in particular if we do not successfully expand our 2d horizontal customer base to our 2d vertical products and 3d modelbased design products as expected then we would not realize the growth we expect and our business would be adversely affected 

expanding our geographic coverage is another key element of our growth strategy we believe that emerging economies continue to present longterm growth opportunities for us although revenue from emerging economies declined 31 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year for all of fiscal 2009 revenue from emerging economies increased 14 as compared to fiscal 2008 revenue from emerging economies represented 18 of fiscal 2009 net revenue as compared to 17 of fiscal 2008 net revenue while we believe there are longterm growth opportunities in emerging economies conducting business in these countries presents significant challenges including the current economic contraction in those countries intellectual property protection and software piracy 

our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products technology and businesses acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers however they entail integration challenges and may in certain instances negatively impact our operating margins we continually review these tradeoffs in making our decisions of whether to make acquisitions the size and frequency of transactions to acquire products technology and businesses increased during fiscal 2009 and the second half of fiscal 2008 as compared to earlier periods we currently anticipate that we will selectively acquire products technology and businesses as compelling opportunities that promote our strategy become available but the pace at which we make such investments will vary depending upon our business needs the availability of suitable sellers and technology and our own financial condition 

global economic conditions deteriorated significantly during our fiscal year ended january 31 2009 economic contraction in most countries and markets and global financial market instability including tighter credit is adversely impacting our business we have seen demand for our products and services decline in each of our major geographies and all the industries we serve particularly during our most recent fiscal quarter that ended on january 31 2009 we have taken and continue to take actions to address these global economic changes and how they are affecting our financial condition our strategy remains focused on leveraging our core strengths and investing in our longterm growth opportunities to achieve our goal of being the world’s leading 2d and 3d design and engineering software and services company for the architecture engineering and construction manufacturing geospatial mapping and digital media and entertainment markets 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we regularly reevaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition our accounting policies and practices are in compliance with statement of position 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended and sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” 

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 

for multiple element arrangements that include software products we allocate the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on their vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value vsoe is the price charged when an element is sold separately or a price set by management with the relevant authority if we do not have vsoe of the undelivered element we defer revenue recognition on the entire sales arrangement until all elements for which we do not have vsoe are delivered we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 

our assessment of likelihood of collection is also a critical factor in determining the timing of revenue recognition if we do not believe that collection is probable the revenue will be deferred until the earlier of when collection is deemed probable or payment is received 

our indirect channel model includes both a twotiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a onetiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers our product license revenue from distributors and resellers are generally recognized at the time title to our product passes to the distributor in a twotiered structure or reseller in a onetiered structure provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met this policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns among other criteria we are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers our policy also presumes that we have no significant performance obligations in connection with the sale of our product licenses by our distributors and resellers to their customers if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

product returns reserves we permit our distributors and resellers to return products up to a percentage of prior quarter purchases the product returns reserve is based on historical experience of actual product returns estimated channel inventory levels the timing of new product introductions and promotions channel sellin for applicable markets and other factors 

our product returns reserves were 125 million at january 31 2009 and 144 million at january 31 2008 product returns as a percentage of applicable revenue were 52 in fiscal 2009 35 in fiscal 2008 and 39 in fiscal 2007 during fiscal year 2009 and 2008 we recorded additions to our product returns reserves of 525 million and 468 million respectively which reduced our revenue 

  

marketable securities at january 31 2009 we had 711 million of short and longterm marketable securities we review our investments in marketable securities quarterly for indicators of otherthantemporary impairment this determination requires significant judgment in making this determination we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value we evaluate among other factors general market conditions the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost and our intent and ability to hold the investment we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the sponsor including industry and sector performance operational and financing cash flow factors and rating agency actions once a decline in fair value is determined to be otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded to our consolidated statements of income this impairment results in a new cost basis in the investment recorded in our consolidated balance sheets if market industry andor sponsor conditions deteriorate we may incur future impairments 

determining the fair value of marketable securities that are not actively traded requires significant judgment we recorded a 45 million impairment charge during fiscal 2009 this impairment related to investments in two money market funds the reserve international liquidity fund the “international fund” and the reserve primary fund the “primary fund” and together with the international fund the “reserve funds” we believe this impairment charge is otherthantemporary therefore we recorded the amount as an expense under “interest and other income expense net” in our consolidated statements of income the impairment occurred as a result of the reserve funds revaluing their holdings of debt securities issued by lehman brothers which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on september 15 2008 and the resulting unusually high redemption requests on the reserve funds certain past and future distributions from the reserve funds are currently under dispute by fund investors and the actual amount of the loss on these investments is uncertain at this time the cost basis of our investment in the reserve funds immediately prior to september 15 2008 was 1128 million we received 750 million in distributions from the reserve funds during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 as of january 31 2009 the cost basis of amounts still invested in the reserve funds by us and awaiting distribution was approximately 378 million we believe we will receive substantially all of our remaining investment balance within the next twelve months therefore these assets are classified as current in our consolidated balance sheet 

in addition at january 31 2009 we had auction rate securities with an estimated fair value of 76 million 90 million cost basis included in noncurrent “marketable securities” due to their lack of liquidity we determined that these securities are otherthantemporarily impaired and we recorded a 14 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 see further discussion of these reserve fund and auction rate securities in liquidity and capital resources section below 

goodwill we test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment when assessing goodwill for impairment we use discounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether goodwill is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge impairment charges if any result from instances where the fair values of net assets associated with goodwill are less than their carrying values as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

we recorded an impairment charge of approximately 1282 million affecting the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 representing the entire goodwill balance associated with our media and entertainment “me” segment as of october 31 2008 during the fourth quarter revenue and cash flow projections for all segments were substantially impacted by the sharp downturn in the global economy and in our business the me segment was the only segment which had a current fair value of its future discounted cash flows that fell below the carrying value of its assets should our revenue and cash flow projections decline significantly in the future additional impairment charges may be recorded on goodwill see further discussion of this impairment charge in note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

realizability of longlived assets we assess the realizability of our longlived assets and related intangible assets other than goodwill annually during the fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review significant underperformance of a business or product line relative to budget shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends and the results of past impairment reviews 

in assessing the recoverability of these longlived assets we first determine their fair values which are based on assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows that could reasonably be generated by these assets if impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows we discounted the cash flows to assess impairments on longlived assets variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge impairment charges if any result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values 

in addition to our recoverability assessments we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our longlived assets any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made as well as in subsequent quarters 

we will continue to evaluate the values of our longlived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

income taxes we currently have 1337 million of net deferred tax assets mostly arising from tax credits net operating losses and timing differences for reserves accrued liabilities stock options purchased technologies and capitalized software partially offset by the establishment of us deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries and acquired intangibles we perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets and believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors these changes if any may require possible material adjustments to these net deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determinations are made 

stockbased compensation  we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 123—revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement stockbased compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period sfas 123r requires companies to estimate the fair value of stockbased payment awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of income we use the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model for determining the estimated fair value for employee stock awards this model requires the input of assumptions including expected stock price volatility expected life expected dividend yield and riskfree interest rate of each award the parameters used in the model are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted as needed compensation expense for employee stock awards is recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period of the award 

legal contingencies  as described in part i item 3 “legal proceedings” and part ii item 8 note 6 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss because of inherent 

  

uncertainties related to these legal matters we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations

overview of fiscal 2009 results of operations 

 

 during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 net revenue increased 7 gross profit increased 7 and income from operations decreased 45 we expect net revenue to decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal 2010 as a result of adverse economic pressures on our customers 

during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 we experienced a dramatic change in the economic conditions of our markets globally the first two quarters of fiscal 2009 were characterized by net revenue growth of 18 over the same period in the prior fiscal year and we reported an increase in income from operations of 20 for that sixmonth period which was only slightly lower compared to the same period of the prior year as a result of our acquisition activity during the first six months of fiscal 2009 due to the deteriorating global economic conditions during our third and fourth fiscal quarters our results for the second half of fiscal 2009 were a stark contrast to the first half of the fiscal year revenue for the second half of fiscal 2009 declined by 4 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year revenue decreased sequentially 2 and 19 during our third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 respectively income from operations for the second half of fiscal 2009 was approximately breakeven compared to a positive 20 operating margin for the second half of fiscal 2008 the third quarter fiscal 2009 positive operating margin of approximately 23 was offset by a 27 negative operating margin in the fourth quarter fiscal 2009 due primarily to a goodwill and intangibles impairment charge of 1289 million and a restructuring charge of 402 million 

our primary goals for fiscal 2009 were to continue delivering our marketleading products and solutions to our customers to drive revenue growth and to invest in product functionality and new product lines while minimizing the impact of these investments on gross profit operating margins and operating cash flow due primarily to the deterioration of the economy during the second half of the year we were unable to achieve our revenue operating margin and net income goals in january 2009 we announced a restructuring plan to reduce headcount by approximately 10 and to consolidate certain facilities around the world in order to reduce our operating expenses see further discussion of our restructuring plan in note 14 “restructuring reserves” of the notes to consolidated financial statements we are taking other actions in an attempt to stimulate demand and align our cost structure with the reality of our recent and anticipated financial results including a hiring freeze travel restrictions and other expense initiatives in taking these actions we may incur additional costs which could negatively impact our net income and cash flows from operating activities 

  

the 45 decrease in income from operations in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was primarily due to goodwill and intangibles impairment charges of 1289 million or 29 percentage points of the 45 decrease affecting the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 principally associated with our me segment and a restructuring charge of 402 million or 9 percentage points of the 45 decrease as well as the impact of inprocess research and development expenses and intangibles amortization from our acquisition activity 

net revenue for fiscal 2009 increased by 7 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to a 29 increase in maintenance revenue slightly offset by a 1 decrease in license and other revenue net revenue for our 3d modelbased design products increased 23 while net revenue from our 2d products remained flat during fiscal 2009 as compared to the prior fiscal year a critical component of our growth strategy is to continue to add new 2d horizontal users while expanding our customers’ portfolios to include our higher value 2d vertical and 3d modelbased design products for fiscal 2009 we experienced growth in net revenue in europe middle east africa “emea” and asia pacific “apac” 

we generate a significant amount of our revenue in the united states and in countries outside the united states such as japan germany france the united kingdom italy the russian federation canada south korea china and australia we benefited from a weaker us dollar relative to foreign currencies in the first three quarters of fiscal 2009 the trend reversed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 with the us dollar strengthening against most currencies the weaker value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies for the majority of fiscal 2009 had a positive effect of 56 million on operating income in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 had exchange rates from fiscal 2008 been in effect during fiscal 2009 “on a constant currency basis” translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been 79 million lower and operating expenses would have been 23 million lower this represents a 4 increase in net revenue and a 2 decrease in income from operations on a constant currency basis during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue and income from operations in future periods we use foreign currency forward and option collar contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions 

our total operating margin decreased from 21 of net revenue in fiscal 2008 to 11 in fiscal 2009 this decrease is primarily due to the goodwill and intangibles impairment charge and the restructuring charge discussed above these decreases were partially offset by a net revenue increase of 7 

even in these challenging economic times we will continue to invest in growth and productivity initiatives so that we will be better positioned for growth when the economy improves over the longer term we intend to continue to balance investments in revenue growth opportunities with our goal of increasing our operating margins our operating margins are very sensitive to changes in revenue given the relatively fixed nature of most of our expenses which consist primarily of employeerelated expenditures facilities costs and depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal 2010 we expect total costs and expenses to decrease in absolute dollars as we continue to work on finding ways to align our cost structure with our current financial condition and increase as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 however there can be no assurance that our cost structure will not increase in the future or that we will be able to align our cost structure with our expected actual financial results in addition in taking these actions we may incur additional costs which could negatively impact our net income and cash flows from operating activities for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we expect that our net income will be negative 

net cash flows provided by operating activities of 5939 million for fiscal 2009 was primarily comprised of net income and the net effect of noncash expenses associated with stockbased compensation the impairment of goodwill and intangibles primarily related to our me segment as well as restructuring charges we expect net cash flows provided by operating activities to be negative in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 as a result of lower revenue combined with cash expenditures in the quarter for payments of the annual employee incentive plan and payments related to our restructuring plan 

  

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including tech data corporation and its global affiliates “tech data” tech data accounted for 14 14 and 12 of autodesk’s consolidated net revenue for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

we finished fiscal 2009 with 9887 million in cash and marketable securities of which 76 million is classified as longterm this is an increase from the 9577 million balance at january 31 2008 we had a 500 million draw outstanding on our 2500 million available us line of credit at january 31 2009 we finished fiscal 2009 with 5939 million of cash from operating activities as compared to 7085 million during the previous fiscal year operating cash flows declined primarily due to the significant decrease in net income and a reduction of accrued bonuses and commissions for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 we expect cash flow from operating activities to be negative as a result of lower revenue combined with cash outlays in the quarter for payments of the annual employee incentive plan and payments relating to the restructuring plan in fiscal 2009 we purchased 80 million shares of our common stock for 2566 million and continued to invest in our business through acquisitions and investments in other growth initiatives comparatively during the prior fiscal year we repurchased 121 million shares of our common stock for 5630 million and also completed several acquisitions we completed fiscal 2009 with a higher deferred revenue balance and lower accounts receivable balance as compared to the previous fiscal year our deferred revenue balance at january 31 2009 included 4750 million of customer maintenance contracts related to our maintenance program which will be recognized as maintenance revenue ratably over the life of the contracts which is predominantly one year 

results of operations 

net revenue 

 

   

fiscal 2009 net revenue compared to fiscal 2008 net revenue 

license and other revenue 

license and other revenue are comprised of two components all forms of product license revenue and other revenue product license revenue includes revenue from the sale of new seat licenses revenue from the autodesk upgrade program and revenue from the autodesk crossgrade program other revenue consists of revenue from consulting and training services revenue from the autodesk developers network autodesk collaborative solution hosting revenue revenue from autodesk’s former location services division and revenue from advanced systems product support we divested the location services division in february 2009 and we do not expect further revenue to be received from it see note 15 “subsequent events” in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

total license and other revenue decreased 1 during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 commercial new seat revenue from our 3d modelbased design products and 2d products for fiscal 2009 was flat compared to fiscal 2008 during fiscal 2009 we experienced a decrease of approximately 13 percentage points due to lower number of seat licenses sold offset by an increase of approximately 13 percentage points due to higher average net revenue per seat during fiscal 2009 there was less correlation between revenue growth and seat license growth due to changes in our mix of geographies and products proportion of maintenance in the user base currency exchange rates and average selling prices and we expect this trend to continue as a percentage of total net revenue license and other revenue was 69 for fiscal 2009 75 for fiscal 2008 and 77 for fiscal 2007 we expect license and other revenue to decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 as a result of adverse economic pressures on our customers 

upgrade revenue which includes crossgrade revenue decreased by 8 during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 as expected the decrease in upgrade revenue was driven primarily from the relatively smaller size of the upgradeable base of our autocadbased products in fiscal 2009 as compared to the upgradeable base of our autocadbased products in fiscal 2008 due to more customers on our maintenance program over the long term we expect revenue from upgrades to decrease as we continue to move customers onto our maintenance program 

revenue from the sales of our services training and support included in “license and other” represented less than 4 of net revenue for all periods presented 

maintenance revenue 

under our maintenance program customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades when and if available downloadable training courses and online support we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the maintenance contract periods maintenance revenue increased 29 for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 approximately 20 percentage points of the 29 increase was due to increases in program enrollment and approximately 9 percentage points of the increase was due to higher net revenue per maintenance seat for fiscal 2009 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year as a percentage of total net revenue maintenance revenue was 31 for fiscal 2009 25 for fiscal 2008 and 23 for fiscal 2007 our maintenance program available to most customers worldwide continues to provide a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of upgrades and enhancements when and if released during the term of their contracts we expect maintenance revenue to decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal 2010 as a result of decreased program enrollment from declines in new product sales as well as maintenance attach and renewal rates at january 31 2009 our maintenance program enrollment consisted of about 17 million users 

aggregate backlog at january 31 2009 and january 31 2008 was 5695 million and 5215 million respectively of which 5521 million and 5061 million respectively represented deferred revenue and 174 million and 154 million respectively related to current software license product orders that had not yet shipped at the end of each respective fiscal year deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred maintenance revenue 

  

to a lesser extent deferred revenue consists of deferred license and other revenue derived from collaborative project management services consulting services and deferred license sales backlog from current software license product orders that we have not yet shipped consists of orders for currently available licensed software products from customers with approved credit status and may include orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period 

net revenue by geographic area 

net revenue in the americas region decreased by 3 during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 as a result of a 15 decrease in revenue from new seats in the americas and a 19 decrease in revenue from upgrades offset in part by a 16 increase in maintenance revenue growth in the americas was affected by a slowing economy that impacted growth rates for all of our products in fiscal 2009 

net revenue in emea increased by 15 or 9 on a constant currency basis during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to a 39 increase in maintenance revenue and a 6 increase in new seat revenue slightly offset by a 1 decrease in revenue from upgrades emea’s growth during fiscal 2009 was primarily due to growth in the emea emerging economies as well as in germany france switzerland italy belgium and sweden the positive effect of the weaker value of the us dollar relative to the euro the british pound and other european currencies also contributed to the increase in net revenue in emea had exchange rates during fiscal 2008 been in effect during fiscal 2009 translated net revenue in emea would have been 53 million lower in fiscal 2009 

net revenue in apac increased by 7 or 2 on a constant currency basis during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to a 36 increase in maintenance revenue and a 3 increase in new seat revenue partially offset by a 4 decrease in revenue from upgrades net revenue growth in apac during fiscal 2009 occurred primarily due to growth in japan and australia net revenue from apac emerging economies in fiscal 2009 was flat compared to the prior fiscal year had exchange rates during fiscal 2008 been in effect during fiscal 2009 translated net revenue in apac would have been 27 million lower in fiscal 2009 

we believe that international net revenue will continue to comprise a majority of our total net revenue international net revenue represented 72 of our net revenue in fiscal 2009 and 69 of our net revenue in fiscal 2008 we started to experience some economic difficulty in international sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 global conditions have worsened since then and the economic downturn significantly impacted our international sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 particularly the robust business we had been seeing in emerging economies net revenue in emerging economies grew by 14 from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 primarily due to revenue from the russian federation other emea emerging economies and india this growth was a significant factor in our international sales growth during fiscal 2009 in contrast fourth quarter fiscal 2009 net revenue in the emea and apac regions decreased 16 and 25 respectively compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and net revenue from emerging economies declined 31 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year further economic weakness in any of the countries that contributes a significant portion of our net revenue could have an even greater adverse effect on our business in those countries changes in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could also significantly affect our future financial results for a given period 

net revenue by operating segment 

net revenue for pseb increased 2 during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to a 3 increase in revenue from autocad lt partially offset by a 1 decrease in revenue from autocad 

net revenue for aec increased 9 during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to a 22 increase in revenue from autodesk revit this increase was partially offset by a 13 decrease in revenue from autocad architecture also contributing to the increase in aec’s net revenue during fiscal 2009 was an increase in revenue from the autodesk robot structural analysis robobat and autodesk navisworks products 

  

net revenue for msd increased 17 during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to an 8 increase in revenue from autodesk inventor products and a 12 increase in revenue from autocad mechanical contributing 7 percentage points of the 17 increase in msd’s net revenue for fiscal 2009 was revenue from the autodesk moldflow products of 308 million 

net revenue for me increased 1 during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to a 9 increase in net revenue from our animation product group the increase in animation revenue was primarily due to a 25 increase in revenue from autodesk 3ds max net revenue from advanced systems decreased 8 during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 

fiscal 2008 net revenue compared to fiscal 2007 net revenue 

license and other revenue 

growth in license and other revenue during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to growth in new seat revenue for most major products driven by the release of our 2008 family of products total license and other revenue increased 14 for fiscal 2008 as compared to the prior fiscal year this growth was primarily due to a 20 increase in commercial new seat revenue from our 2d products and 3d modelbased design products this 20 increase largely was driven by the release of our 2008 family of products slightly less than 13 percentage points of the 20 increase was due to higher average revenue per seat and approximately 7 percentage points of the 20 increase was due to increases in the number of seats sold as a percentage of total net revenue license and other revenue was 75 for fiscal 2008 77 for fiscal 2007 and 82 for fiscal 2006 

revenue from the sale of new seats increased 19 from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 the increase is due to an 18 increase in revenue from new seats of our 2d products primarily autocad lt autocad autocad mechanical and autocad architecture the increase was also due to a 30 increase in revenue from new seats of our 3d modelbased design products autodesk revit products autodesk inventor products autocad civil 3d and autodesk navisworks software the increase in new seat revenue was driven primarily by higher average net revenue per seat and volume growth in both our 2d design and 3d modelbased design products 

the positive effect of the weaker value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies also contributed to the increase in total net revenue in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 in addition we experienced growth in net revenue in all three of our geographic regions and strong growth in the emerging economies of emea and apac 

upgrade revenue which includes crossgrade revenue decreased by 17 during fiscal 2008 as compared to the prior fiscal year as expected the decrease in upgrade revenue was driven primarily from the relatively smaller size of the upgradeable base of our autocadbased products in fiscal 2008 as compared to the upgradeable base of our autocadbased products in fiscal 2007 due to more customers on our maintenance program in addition during the second half of fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 autocad lt customers could crossgrade to any other product at a promotional rate which contributed approximately 91 million to upgrade revenue in fiscal 2008 as compared to 214 million in fiscal 2007 

maintenance revenue 

maintenance revenue increased 31 for fiscal 2008 as compared to the prior fiscal year as a percentage of total net revenue maintenance revenue was 25 for fiscal 2008 23 for fiscal 2007 and 18 for fiscal 2006 

due to the increase in our maintenance base over time the relative upgradeable installed base of the autocadbased products not on maintenance during fiscal 2008 was smaller than the upgradeable installed base of the autocadbased products not on maintenance during fiscal 2007 

  

aggregate backlog at january 31 2008 and january 31 2007 was 5215 million and 3958 million respectively of which 5061 million and 3788 million represented deferred revenue and 154 million and 170 million respectively related to current software license product orders which have not yet shipped at the end of each respective fiscal year 

net revenue by geographic area 

net revenue in the americas region increased by 9 during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to a 22 increase in maintenance revenue revenue from new seats in the americas increased 2 during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 driven by new seat revenue from our 3d modelbased design products offset by a decline in new seat revenue from our 2d products compared to the prior fiscal year revenue from upgrades decreased by 14 in the americas during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior fiscal year growth in the americas was also impacted by a slowing economy that impacted growth rates for all of our products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 had exchange rates during fiscal 2007 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2008 translated net revenue in the americas would have been 01 million lower in fiscal 2008 

net revenue in emea increased by 27 during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to a 37 increase in new seat revenue and 40 increase in maintenance revenue revenue from new seats in emea increased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 driven by new seat revenue from our 2d design products and 3d modelbased design products these increases were partially offset by 24 decrease in revenue from upgrades emea’s growth during fiscal 2008 was primarily due to growth in the emea emerging economies the united kingdom germany france belgium and austria had exchange rates during fiscal 2007 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2008 translated net revenue in emea would have been 667 million lower in fiscal 2008 

net revenue in apac increased 18 during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to an 18 increase in new seats revenue a 32 increase in maintenance revenue and a 9 increase in revenue from upgrades revenue from new seats in apac increased due to strong new seat revenue from our 2d products and 3d modelbased design products net revenue growth in apac during fiscal 2008 occurred primarily due to growth in the apac emerging economies japan south korea and australia had exchange rates during fiscal 2007 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2008 translated net revenue in apac would have been 44 million lower in fiscal 2008 

international net revenue represented 69 of our net revenue in fiscal 2008 and 66 of our net revenue in fiscal 2007 net revenue in emerging economies grew by 40 from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 primarily due to revenue from the emea emerging economies china and india this growth was a significant factor in our international sales growth during fiscal 2008 

net revenue by operating segment 

net revenue for pseb increased 13 during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to a 24 increase in revenue from autocad lt and a 6 increase in revenue from autocad 

net revenue for aec increased 26 during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to a 40 increase in revenue from autodesk revit a 24 increase in revenue from autocad civil 3d and a 9 increase in revenue from autocad architecture 

net revenue for msd increased 25 during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to a 17 increase in revenue from autodesk inventor products and a 28 increase in revenue from autocad mechanical 

net revenue for me increased 10 during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 during fiscal 2008 net revenue from our animation product group increased 22 due to increases in revenue from our animation products 3ds max and maya net revenue growth from advanced systems was flat as compared to the prior fiscal year due to the migration of our advanced systems solutions from silicon graphics inc “sgi” hardware to pcbased hardware systems which have a lower price but generate better margins 

  

cost of revenue 

 

 cost of license and other revenue includes direct material and overhead charges labor costs of fulfilling service contracts and order processing including stockbased compensation expense for these employees royalties and amortization of purchased technology direct material and overhead charges include the cost of hardware sold mainly pcbased workstations for advanced systems in the me segment costs associated with transferring our software to electronic media printing of user manuals and packaging materials and shipping and handling costs 

cost of license and other revenue increased 6 during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 even though license and other revenue decreased by 1 cost of license and other revenue increased in fiscal 2009 due to an increase in amortization of purchased technology due to the number of acquisitions completed during fiscal years 2009 and 2008 slightly offset by decreases in employeerelated expenses since many of these costs are headcountrelated expenses they do not vary proportionally with changes in revenue cost of license and other revenue decreased 5 during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due primarily to a shift in advanced systems from sgi hardware to pcbased hardware 

cost of maintenance revenue includes costs of sales associated with our maintenance program costs of maintenance revenue remained relatively consistent in both relative dollars and as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 costs of maintenance revenue remained relatively consistent in both relative dollars and as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 

cost of revenue at least over the near term is affected by the volume and mix of product sales changing consulting costs software amortization costs royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products new customer support offerings and the effect of expensing employee stockbased compensation expense we expect cost of revenue to decline in absolute dollars during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 with decreases in revenue as we continue to find ways to reduce our operating expenses to align with our financial condition and increase as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 

marketing and sales 

 

 marketing and sales expenses include salaries benefits bonuses and stockbased compensation expense for our marketing and sales employees and costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue such as advertising trade shows and expositions and various sales and promotional programs marketing and sales expenses also include travel and facility costs for our marketing sales dealer training and order support personnel sales and dealer commissions labor costs of sales order processing and overhead charges 

  

marketing and sales expense increased 6 during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to 550 million of higher employeerelated costs driven by increased marketing and sales headcount in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 

marketing and sales expense increased 21 during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to 955 million of higher employeerelated costs driven by increased marketing and sales headcount and increased commissions and commission accelerators from higher revenue in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 the increase was also due to 185 million of increased marketing and promotion costs related to product launches trade shows branding and demand generation 

we expect to continue to invest in marketing and sales of our products to develop market opportunities to promote our competitive position and to strengthen our channel support but at a slower pace we expect marketing and sales expense to decrease in absolute dollars during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 as we continue to find ways to reduce our operating expenses to align with our financial condition and increase as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 

research and development 

 

 research and development expenses which are expensed as incurred consist primarily of salaries benefits bonuses and stockbased compensation expense for research and development employees purchased inprocess research and development expense overhead charges and fees paid to software development firms and independent contractors 

research and development expenses increased 17 during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to an increase in employee related costs of 638 million driven by increased research and development headcount also contributing to the increase in research and development expenses was 269 million of inprocess research and development from acquisitions during fiscal 2009 these increases were partially offset by a 31 million reduction in stockbased compensation expense for our research and development employees 

research and development expenses increased 19 during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to an increase in employee related costs of 332 million driven by increased research and development headcount and an 116 million increase in consulting services and inprocess technology purchases from hanna strategies also contributing to the increase in research and development expenses was 55 million of inprocess research and development from acquisitions during fiscal 2008 additionally in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we accelerated certain internal product development initiatives that increased research and development costs 

overall we increased our investment in research and development during fiscal 2009 as compared to the prior fiscal year to create new products and new versions of existing products broader interoperability accelerated localization efforts and improvements in visualization simulation and analysis we expect research and development expense to decrease in absolute dollars during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 as we continue to find ways to reduce our operating expenses to align with our financial condition and increase as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 

  

during fiscal 2008 we incurred a total of approximately 383 million for consulting services and inprocess technology purchases from hanna strategies compared to 267 million in fiscal 2007 the cost of the inprocess technology acquired from hanna strategies was immediately recognized as an expense because the technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we acquired the remaining 72 ownership interest in hanna strategies for net consideration of 135 million see note 13 “business combinations” in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this acquisition 

general and administrative 

 

 general and administrative expenses include salaries benefits bonuses and stockbased compensation expense for our finance human resources and legal personnel as well as professional fees for legal and accounting services and amortization expense of customer relationships and trademarks acquired 

general and administrative expenses increased 14 from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 primarily due to a 127 million increase in employeerelated costs due to an increase in general and administrative headcount and a 141 million increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets during fiscal 2009 general and administrative expenses increased 12 from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 primarily due to a 196 million increase in employee related costs due to an increase in general and administrative headcount we expect general and administrative expense to decrease in absolute dollars during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 as we continue to find ways to reduce our operating expenses to align with our financial condition and increase as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 

impairment of goodwill and intangibles 

 

  

 we recorded a 1289 million impairment charge affecting the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 primarily related to impairment of goodwill associated with our me segment during the three months ended january 31 2009 revenue and cash flow projections for all segments decreased substantially as the economy worsened the me segment was the only segment which had a current fair value that fell below the carrying value of its assets should our revenue and cash flow projections decline significantly in the future additional impairment charges may be recorded on goodwill see note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

restructuring 

 

  

 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we initiated a restructuring program in order to reduce our operating costs this program will reduce the number of employees by a total of approximately 750 fulltime positions globally and will result in the consolidation of up to 27 leased facilities in connection with this restructuring plan we recorded restructuring charges totaling 402 million related to onetime termination benefits for the elimination of approximately 620 of these fulltime positions globally and we began the consolidation of nine leased facilities during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 charges associated with these onetime termination benefits and consolidation of leased facilities have been recorded in accordance with sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” as of january 31 2009 13 million was paid the remaining accrual associated with the termination benefits is expected to be substantially paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 in the first half of fiscal 2010 we expect to record approximately 15 million to 20 million primarily related to onetime employee severance arrangements for the elimination of approximately 130 fulltime positions globally and approximately 10 million to 15 million related to the consolidation of leased facilities we expect to pay the facility related liabilities through fiscal 2018 if our revenue should continue to decline significantly we will look to further reduce our operating expenses to align them with our financial condition including the possibility of a further restructuring in taking these actions we may incur additional costs which could negatively impact our net income and cash flows from operating activities see note 14 “restructuring reserves” in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

interest and other income net 

the following table sets forth the components of interest and other income net 

 

 interest and investment income net fluctuates based on average cash and marketable securities balances average maturities and interest rates the decrease in interest and investment income net during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 is primarily due to lower interest rate yields the increase in interest and investment income net during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 reflects proportionately higher cash balances and interest rate yields during fiscal 2008 the increase in interest and investment income net for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was partially offset by a loss on a cost method investment and an impairment of our historical 28 equity investment in hanna strategies 

  

our historical 28 ownership interest in hanna strategies accounted for under accounting principles board opinion no 18 “the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock” and fasb interpretation no 35 “criteria for applying the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock” resulted in a loss from unconsolidated subsidiary representing our 28 ownership interest in hanna strategies’ results of operations through january 2 2008 when we acquired the remaining 72 

provision for income taxes 

we account for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 109 “accounting for income taxes” “sfas 109” deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse 

on february 1 2007 we adopted fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions under fin 48 companies are required to recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position fin 48 clarified how a company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized provides guidance as to the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits the provisions of fin 48 were effective as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings based on our assessment we recorded an increase to opening retained earnings during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 for tax benefits not previously recognized of 264 million as a result of adopting fin 48 

our effective tax rate was 27 and 24 during fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively our effective tax rate increased 3 from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2009 primarily due to nondeductible goodwill impairment and inprocess research and development expenses 

our effective tax rate was 24 and 21 during fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively our effective tax rate increased 3 from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 primarily as a result of a reduction in tax benefits as a percentage of pretax earnings from the lapse of statute of limitations or audit closures and the phaseout of extraterritorial income exclusion 

our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits and charges from tax amounts associated with our foreign earnings that are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate research credits state income taxes sfas 123r fin 48 fas 141r us manufacturer’s deduction closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits changes in valuation allowances and changes in tax law 

at january 31 2009 we had net deferred tax assets of 1337 million we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize these assets 

for additional information regarding our income tax provision see note 3 “income taxes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of cash is from the sale of licenses to our products our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employeerelated expenses such as compensation and benefits as well as general operating expenses for marketing facilities and overhead costs in addition to operating expenses we also use cash to invest in our growth initiatives which include acquisitions of products technology and businesses and to fund our stock repurchase program see further discussion of these items below 

at january 31 2009 our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities totaling 9811 million net accounts receivable of 3165 million and 521 million of outstanding under our lines of credit we have a us line of credit facility that permits unsecured shortterm borrowings of up to 2500 million and a china line of credit that permits unsecured shortterm borrowings of up to 50 million these line of credit agreements contain customary covenants that could restrict the imposition of liens on our assets and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or make dispositions of assets if we fail to maintain their financial covenants the lines of credit are available for working capital or other business needs we drew on the us line of credit during fiscal 2009 due to temporary differences between cash needs and cash availability in the us during fiscal 2009 we principally used the facility to fund the 80 million share stock repurchase and for the acquisition of moldflow at january 31 2009 we had 500 million outstanding on the us line of credit at january 31 2009 we had 21 million outstanding on the china line of credit we drew on the china line of credit due to temporary differences between cash needs and cash availability in china the us facility expires in august 2012 and the current china facility draw matures in may 2009 the china facility is a shortterm revolving facility which may be canceled or called at any time with 30 days’ written notice as of march 18 2009 the balances outstanding on the us and china line of credit facilities were 100 million and 21 million respectively 

our primary commercial banking relationship is with citibank and its global affiliates “citibank” our cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally and the portion of our cash and cash equivalents held by citibank has been significantly reduced during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 citicorp usa inc an affiliate of citibank is the lead lender and agent in the syndicate of our 2500 million us line of credit recently citibank like many financial institutions has obtained government assistance 

at january 31 2009 our shortterm investment portfolio consisted of term deposits money market funds and mutual funds with an estimated fair value of 635 million and a cost basis of 680 million of this cost basis amount 199 million was invested in a defined set of mutual funds as directed by the participants in our deferred compensation plan see note 4 “deferred compensation” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion and 103 million was invested in bank term deposits with original maturities greater than 90 days and less than one year the remaining 378 million was invested in two money market funds 351 million was invested in the reserve international liquidity fund the “international fund” and 27 million was invested in the reserve primary fund the “primary fund” and together with the international fund the “reserve funds” in midseptember the reserve funds ceased redemptions after net asset values of the funds decreased below 1 per share this occurred as a result of the reserve funds revaluing their holdings of debt securities issued by lehman brothers which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on september 15 2008 and the resulting unusually high redemption requests on the reserve funds accordingly we recorded 45 million otherthantemporary impairment impacting fiscal 2009 the impairment expense was recorded in “interest and other income expense net” in the consolidated statements of income 

the timing of redemptions from the reserve funds currently is undetermined the sec is overseeing the administration accounting and payout of the usbased primary fund and a third party court appointed supervisor is overseeing but not managing the accounting and payment administration of the non usbased international fund at this time these investments are not currently liquid and in the event we need to access these funds we will not be able to do so however it is our current belief that the distributions for the reserve funds will occur within the next 12 months accordingly the reserve funds are classified in current “marketable securities” in the consolidated balance sheets as of january 31 2009 this redesignation is included in “purchases of 

  

availableforsale marketable securities” in the investing activities section of the consolidated statements of cash flows in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 the reserve funds made a partial distribution under which we received 750 million leaving an additional 378 million on a cost basis still outstanding 

at january 31 2009 our investment portfolio included two auction rate securities with an estimated fair value of 76 million and a cost basis of 90 million our auction rate securities are variable rate debt instruments that have underlying securities with contractual maturities greater than ten years and interest rates that were structured to reset at auction every 28 days the securities which met our investment guidelines at the time the investments were made have failed to settle in auctions since august 2007 in addition these auction rate securities which were previously aaarated were downgraded during fiscal 2009 under the contractual terms of these investments because the auctions failed to settle the interest rate on these investments reset by increasing to the libor rate plus 200 basis points which represents a premium interest rate on these investments at this time these investments are not currently liquid and in the event we need to access these funds we will not be able to do so without a loss of principal unless a future auction is successful or a secondary market is available in fiscal 2009 we recorded an otherthantemporary impairment of 14 million related to these investments the impairment expense was recorded in “interest and other income expense net” in the consolidated statements of income due to the lack of liquidity of these investments they are included in “marketable securities—noncurrent” we will continue to evaluate our accounting for our investments on a quarterly basis see note 12 “financial instruments” in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our financial instruments 

net cash flows provided by operating activities of 5939 million for fiscal 2009 was primarily comprised of net income and the net effect of noncash expenses associated with the impairment of goodwill and intangibles primarily related to our me segment as well as restructuring charges the primary working capital sources of cash were decreases in accounts receivable and increases in deferred revenue the decrease in accounts receivable relates primarily to reduced billings at the end of fiscal 2009 due to a decline in revenue our days sales outstanding in trade receivables reflect the seasonality in maintenance billings and was 59 days at january 31 2009 and 2008 the primary working capital use of cash was decreased accrued expenses primarily due to lower accrued employee bonuses and commissions we expect net cash flows provided by operating activities to be negative in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 as a result of lower revenue combined with cash expenditures in the quarter for payments of the annual employee incentive plan and payments related to our restructuring plan 

other than the draws on the lines of credit discussed above there have been no material changes in our contractual obligations or commercial commitments longterm cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following the acquisition of new businesses software products or technologies complementary to our business capital expenditures including the purchase and implementation of internaluse software applications stock repurchases and funding restructuring costs in addition 199 million of our marketable securities are held in a rabbi trust under nonqualified deferred compensation plans as of january 31 2009 see note 4 “deferred compensation” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations to minimize the effect of these fluctuations we use foreign currency option contracts and forwards to hedge our exposure on anticipated transactions and forward contracts to hedge our exposure on firm commitments primarily certain receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies prior to the quarter ended october 31 2008 our foreign currency instruments by practice had maturities of less than three months and settled before the end of each quarterly period during fiscal 2009 we entered into foreign currency instruments with maturities longer than three months that did not settle before the end of each quarterly period we have expanded our hedge program beyond the current quarter to reduce foreign currency risk and volatility by entering into cash flow hedges for one to 12 months in the future with reduced protection for our longer term hedge instruments the principal currencies hedged during fiscal 2009 were the euro british pound japanese yen swiss franc and canadian dollar we monitor our foreign exchange exposures to review the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions 

  

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at january 31 2009 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at january 31 2009 

 

  

  for the purposes of this table contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on autodesk and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction 

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies services and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies services or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however in most instances the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty in addition we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products royalty expense is generally based on the number of units shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue royalty expense included in cost of license and other revenue was 171 million in fiscal 2009 149 million in fiscal 2008 and 168 million in fiscal 2007 

principal commitments at january 31 2009 shown above consist of obligations under operating leases for facilities and computer equipment it infrastructure costs marketing costs and contractual software development services purchase commitments also include 217 million related to a termination fee for an outsource application hosting services agreement entered into during fiscal 2006 this fee is reduced as time elapses during the fiveyear contract period 

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees including limited product warranties historically costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant but because potential future costs are highly variable we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations 

  

issuer purchases of equity securities 

our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to 1640 million shares the purpose of the stock repurchase program is to help offset the dilution to net income per share caused by the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders the number of shares acquired and the timing of the purchases are based on several factors including general market conditions the volume of employee stock option exercises the trading price of our common stock cash on hand and available in the us and company defined trading windows there were no repurchases of our common stock during the three months ended january 31 2009 during the year ended january 31 2009 we repurchased 80 million shares of our common stock at january 31 2009 161 million shares remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization this program does not have a fixed expiration date see note 7 “shareholders’ equity” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than operating leases we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing arrangements or have any variableinterest entities as of january 31 2009 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

stock compensation 

as of january 31 2009 we maintained two active stock option plans for the purpose of granting stock options to employees and nonemployee members of our board of directors the 2008 employee stock plan “2008 plan” which is available only to employees and the 2000 directors’ option plan as amended “2000 plan” which is available only to nonemployee directors additionally there are six expired or terminated plans with options outstanding including the 2006 employee stock plan “2006 plan” which was replaced by the 2008 employee stock plan in march 2008 

the 2008 plan was approved by our stockholders in november 2007 under this plan 165 million shares of our common stock and 048 million shares that remained available for issuance under the 2006 plan upon its expiration were reserved for issuance the 2008 plan permits the grant of stock options restricted stock and restricted stock units however no more than 25 million of the shares reserved for issuance under the 2008 plan may be issued pursuant to awards of restricted stock units at january 31 2009 134 million shares were available for future issuance under the 2008 plan the 2008 plan will expire in march 2011 the 2000 plan which was originally approved by the stockholders in june 2000 allows for an automatic annual grant of options to nonemployee members of autodesk’s board of directors at january 31 2009 08 million shares were available for future issuance the 2000 plan will expire in march 2010 

our stock option program is broadbased and designed to promote longterm retention essentially all of our employees participate approximately 90 of the options we granted during fiscal 2009 were awarded to employees other than our ceo cfo and the three other most highly compensated officers for fiscal 2009 which we refer to as our named executive officers options granted under the 2008 plan and the 2000 plan vest over periods ranging from one to four years and expire within four to seven years of the date of grant during fiscal 2009 and 2008 the exercise price of all stock options granted under these plans was equal to the fair market value of the stock on the grant date 

all stock option grants to executive officers are made by the compensation and human resources committee of the board of directors all members of the compensation and human resources committee are independent directors as defined by the listing standards of the nasdaq global select market grants to our nonemployee directors are nondiscretionary and are predetermined by the terms of the 2000 plan 

  

for further information concerning autodesk’s policies and procedures regarding the use of stock options see ”compensation discussion and analysis” incorporated herein by reference to the section entitled “executive compensation” in our proxy statement for our fiscal year 2009 annual meeting of stockholders to be filed with the securities and exchange commission not later than 120 days after the fiscal year ended january 31 2009 

in addition to our stock option plans our employees are also eligible to participate in autodesk’s 1998 employee qualified stock purchase plan “esp plan” eligible employees may purchase shares of autodesk’s common stock at their discretion using up to 15 of their compensation subject to certain limitations at not less than 85 of fair market value as defined in the plan agreement at january 31 2009 248 million shares were available for future issuance this amount will automatically be increased on the first trading day of each fiscal year by an amount equal to the lesser of 100 million shares or 20 of the total outstanding shares plus any shares repurchased by autodesk during the prior fiscal year we typically issue shares on march 31 and september 30 of each fiscal year the provisions of this plan expire during fiscal 2018 

on august 17 2006 we disclosed that the audit committee of the board of directors was conducting a voluntary review of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting issues due to this review autodesk was not current with its reporting obligations under the securities exchange act of 1934 until june 2007 and suspended contributions and purchases under the esp plan during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and the first quarter of fiscal 2008 on september 18 2006 our board of directors approved an amendment to our esp plan which provided for active participant employees at the time of the suspension to become automatically enrolled in the next offering period unless they elected not to participate the board of directors also approved a onetime cash bonus of 88 million to nonexecutive employees enrolled in the esp plan at that date this bonus approximated the profits employee participants would have made on the scheduled september 30 2006 exercise date had the purchases been made and the shares been sold on the next trading day at close of market and was expensed as additional compensation expense at the time it was paid on march 22 2007 our board of directors approved an amendment which superseded the september 18 2006 amendment which provided for active participant employees at the time of the suspension to become automatically enrolled in the next offering period ending in september 2007 unless they elected not to participate in june 2007 we became current with our financial filings and resumed employee contributions to the esp plan

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend foreign currency exchange risk 

our revenue earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage our foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations prior to the quarter ended october 31 2008 such contracts did not extend beyond the current quarter however beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 we entered into longerterm hedging contracts we have expanded our foreign currency cash flow hedge program beyond one quarter and as of january 31 2009 have open contracts to hedge expected cash flows for one to 12 months in the future in order to reduce foreign currency volatility contracts are primarily denominated in euros japanese yen swiss francs british pounds and canadian dollars we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes the notional amount of our option and forward contracts was 2767 million and 1318 million at january 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

we utilize foreign currency option collar and forward contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue and operating expenses of certain anticipated transactions a sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january 31 2009 indicated that a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 31 2009 would increase the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by 257 million a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the dollar from its value at january 31 2009 would decrease the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by 197 million the results of the sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january 31 2008 indicated that a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 31 2008 would have increased the fair value of our forward exchange and 

  

option contracts by 39 million and a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the dollar from its value at january 31 2008 would have decreased the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by 28 million we do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows as a result of these foreign currency forward and option contracts 

interest rate sensitivity 

at january 31 2009 we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities and short term mutual fund balances of 635 million at january 31 2008 we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities and short term mutual fund balances of 314 million the shortterm mutual fund balances included 199 million at january 31 2009 and 267 million at january 31 2008 of amounts held in a rabbi trust under deferred compensation arrangements see note 4 “deferred compensation” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and shortterm investments assuming an average investment balance of 6942 million in 2009 if interest rates were to increase decrease by 10 this would result in a 03 million increase decrease in annual interest income further at january 31 2009 we held 711 million in money market funds mutual funds bank term deposits and auction rate securities which by their structure are not directly susceptible to valuation changes due to increases or decreases in interest rates 

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy guidelines which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue issuer or type of instrument

product development and introduction 

we continue to enhance our product offerings and develop new products to meet changing customer demands research and development expenditures were 4853 million or 22 of fiscal 2008 net revenue 4063 million or 22 of fiscal 2007 net revenue and 3032 million or 20 of fiscal 2006 net revenue our software is primarily developed internally however we do contract services from software development firms consultants and independent contractors to supplement our development efforts additionally we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing or licensing some or all of the assets or stock of the entity that owns rights to the products or technology 

  

the majority of our basic research and product development is performed in the united states china and canada translation and localization of foreignmarket versions as well as some product development is performed in other local markets particularly in singapore and switzerland we generally translate and localize our products into french italian german spanish japanese and various chinese dialects 

we actively recruit and hire experienced software developers we also use independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities we plan to continue to increase our product development operations internationally over the next several years we believe that our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize product development lower costs and integrate local market knowledge into our development activities we continually assess the significant costs and challenges including intellectual property protection against the benefits of our international development activities for example in january 2008 we purchased the remaining 72 of hanna strategies holdings inc “hanna strategies” a company that had previously been providing development services for us primarily in china 

in addition our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with a network of over 3100 thirdparty developers who develop and sell their own products that further enhance the range of integrated solutions available to our customers 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware operating systems and software in addition our customer’s requirements and preferences rapidly evolve as do their expectations of our software to keep pace with these changes we maintain an aggressive program of new product development to address demands in the marketplace for our products we dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to further enhance our existing products and to create new products and technologies we continually review these investments in an effort to ensure that we are generating sufficient revenue or gaining a competitive advantage to justify their costs for further discussion regarding risks from our product development and introduction efforts see item 1a “risk factors” 

marketing and sales 

we license or sell our products and services in over 160 countries primarily through indirect channels consisting of distributors and resellers to a lesser extent we also transact directly with customers who are primarily large corporations our indirect channel model includes both a twotiered distribution structure where distributors sell to resellers and a onetiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers we have a network of approximately 1700 resellers and distributors worldwide for fiscal 2008 approximately 87 of our revenue was derived from indirect channel sales through distributors and resellers and we expect that the majority of our revenue will continue to be derived from indirect channel sales in the future we employ a variety of incentive programs and promotions to align our reseller channel with our business strategy sales through one distributor tech data corporation and its affiliates accounted for 14 12 and 11 of our net revenue for fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively no other distributor or reseller accounted for 10 or more of our revenue 

our customerrelated operations are divided into three geographic regions the americas europemiddle eastafrica emea and asia pacific and are supported by global marketing and sales organizations these organizations develop and manage overall marketing and sales programs and work closely with a network of domestic and international sales offices 

we also work directly with reseller and distributor sales organizations computer manufacturers other software developers and peripherals manufacturers in cooperative advertising promotions and tradeshow presentations we employ massmarketing techniques such as web casts seminars telemarketing direct mailings and advertising in business and trade journals we have a worldwide user group organization and we have created online user communities dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products 

  

in addition to sales of new software licenses we generate revenue through our autodesk subscription program and autodesk upgrade program these programs are available for a majority of our products and offer our customers two alternatives to migrate to the most recent version of our products 

under the autodesk subscription program customers who own a perpetual use license for the most recent version of the underlying product are able to purchase maintenance that provides them with unspecified upgrades whenandifavailable and are able to download elearning courses and receive online support over a one year or multiyear subscription period revenue from our subscription program is reported separately on our consolidated statements of income and is referred to throughout this document as maintenance revenue 

concurrent with the release of a new product version the autodesk upgrade program allows customers who are not on the subscription program to purchase upgrades but only to the extent that they are still on a supported version of the product typically the cost to upgrade is based on a multiple of the number of versions the customer is upgrading an existing customer also has the option to upgrade to a different disciplinespecific or 3d product which generally has a higher price for a premium fee we refer to this as a crossgrade the cost of a crossgrade is substantially less than the cost of purchasing a new license and is available to subscription customers as well revenue from our upgrade and crossgrade programs is reported on our consolidated statements of income in license and other 

our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller networks computer software resellers and distributors are typically not highly capitalized and have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and may do so in the future while we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of dealers and distributors prior to selling to them if their financial condition were to deteriorate they might not be able to make repeat purchases the loss of or a significant reduction in business with any one of our major international distributors or large resellers could harm our business our reliance on distributors and resellers subjects us to other risks see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion 

we intend to continue to make our products available in foreign languages we believe that international sales will continue to comprise the majority of our net revenue economic weakness in any of the countries where we generate a significant portion of our net revenue including the united states could have an adverse effect on our business a summary of our financial information by geographic location is found in note 11 “segments” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

customer and reseller support 

we provide technical support and training to customers through a leveraged support model augmented by direct programs designed to address certain specific needs our customers rely primarily on the resellers and distributors from which they purchased licenses to our products for technical support however we do provide certain direct support for media and entertainment segment advanced systems customers we support the resellers and distributors through technical product training sales training classes the internet and direct telephone support we also provide online support directly to our customers through our subscription program there are also a number of user group forums in which customers are able to share information 

educational programs 

we offer education programs and specially priced software purchasing options tailored for educational institutions students and faculty to train the next generation of users we also offer classroom support including standardized curricula developed by educators instructor development and a rich assortment of online learning resources users trained on our products are broadly available both from universities and the existing workforce reducing the cost of training for our customers 

  

developer programs 

one of our key strategies is to maintain an openarchitecture design of our software products to facilitate thirdparty development of complementary products and industryspecific software solutions this approach enables customers and third parties to customize solutions for a wide variety of highly specific uses we offer several programs that provide marketing sales technical support and programming tools to developers who develop addon applications for our products over 3100 developers in the autodesk developer network create interoperable products that further enhance the range of integrated solutions available to our customers 

backlog 

we typically ship products shortly after receipt of an order which is common in the software industry our aggregate backlog is primarily comprised of deferred revenue deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred maintenance revenue from our subscription program to a lesser extent deferred revenue consists of deferred license and other revenue derived from autodesk buzzsaw and autodesk constructware consulting services and deferred license sales backlog also includes current software license product orders which have not yet shipped the category of current software license product orders which we have not yet shipped consists of orders from customers with approved credit status for currently available license software products and may include both orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period 

aggregate backlog was 5215 million at january 31 2008 of which 5061 million was deferred revenue and 154 million related to current software license product orders which had not yet shipped at the end of the fiscal year aggregate backlog was 3958 million at january 31 2007 of which 3788 million was deferred revenue and 170 million related to current software license product orders which had not yet shipped at the end of the fiscal year deferred revenue increased over the prior year primarily due to an increase in deferred maintenance revenue resulting from the success of our subscription program we expect deferred maintenance revenue to continue to increase in the future we do not believe that aggregate backlog as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of future results 

competition 

the markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to rapid change we strive to increase our competitive separation by investing in research and development allowing us to bring new products to market and create exciting new versions of existing products that offer compelling efficiencies for our customers we also compete through investments in marketing and sales 

our design solutions segment competes with vendors that specialize primarily in one of the three industry segments in which we compete our competitors range from large global publicly traded companies to small geographically focused firms our primary global competitors in this segment include adobe systems inc bentley systems inc dassault systemes and its subsidiary solidworks corporation environmental systems research institute inc esri intergraph corporation nemetschek ag parametric technology corporation and siemens ag plm software division 

our media and entertainment segment competes with a wide range of different companies from large global publiclytraded corporations to small private entities large organizations that produce products that compete in some or all of our markets include adobe systems inc apple computer inc avid technology sony and thomson the media and entertainment market is highly fragmented with complex interdependencies between many of the larger corporations as a result some of our competitors also own subsidiaries that are our customers or our partners in developing or bringing to market some of our solutions 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of computing power with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the design software 

  

market is characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete both from existing competitors and by entry of competitors with innovative technologies competition is increasingly enhanced by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources that we do see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion of risks regarding competition 

because of these and other factors competitive conditions in these industries are likely to continue to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which could harm our business furthermore in certain markets some of our competitors have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources 

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer new products and to continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to ease of use reliability performance range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation price and training 

intellectual property and licenses 

we maintain an active program to legally protect our investment in technology through intellectual property rights we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions the nature and extent of legal protection associated with each such intellectual property right depends on among other things the type of intellectual property right and the given jurisdiction in which such right arises we believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business including each of our segments 

nonetheless our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws enforcement of intellectual property rights against alleged infringers can sometimes lead to costly litigation and counterclaims our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business 

from time to time we receive claims alleging infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights including patents disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to among other things costly litigation or product shipment delays which could harm our business 

we retain ownership of software we develop all software is licensed to users and provided in object code pursuant to either shrinkwrap embedded or online licenses or signed license agreements these agreements contain restrictions on duplication disclosure and transfer 

we believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our intellectual property and the rapid ongoing technological changes in both the computer hardware and software industries we must rely principally upon software engineering and marketing skills to maintain and enhance our competitive market position 

while we have recovered some revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the full extent to which piracy of our software products exists we believe however that software piracy is and can be expected to be a persistent problem that negatively impacts our revenue 

in addition through various licensing arrangements we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others we expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure licensing arrangements in the future as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions to support continued development and sales of our products and services some of these licensing arrangements require or may require royalty payments and other licensing fees the amount of these payments and fees may depend on various factors 

  

including but not limited to the structure of royalty payments offsetting considerations if any and the degree of use of the licensed technology 

see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion of risks related to protecting our intellectual property 

production and suppliers 

production of our design solutions segment and certain media and entertainment segment software products involves duplication of the software media and the printing of user manuals the purchase of media and the transfer of the software programs onto media for distribution to customers are performed by us and by licensed subcontractors media for our products include dvds which are available from multiple sources user manuals for our products and packaging materials are produced to our specifications by outside sources production is either performed in leased facilities operated by us or by independent thirdparty contractors to date we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the production of our software and documentation 

in addition the advanced systems business line has historically relied on thirdparty vendors for the supply of hardware components used in its systems in the past many of the advanced systems software products ran on workstations manufactured by silicon graphics inc “sgi” over the past two years we transitioned our advanced systems product portfolio to standard open pcbased hardware systems 

employees 

as of january 31 2008 we employed approximately 7300 people none of our employees in the united states are represented by a labor union however in certain foreign countries our employees are represented by work councils we have never experienced any work stoppages and believe our employee relations are good reliance upon employees in other countries entails various risks that possible government instability or regulation unfavorable to foreignowned businesses could negatively impact our business in the future 

competition in recruiting personnel in the software industry especially highly skilled engineers is intense we believe our continued growth and future success is highly dependent on our continued ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees 

  

business combinations 

over the past three years we acquired new technology or supplemented our technology by purchasing businesses focused in specific markets or industries during this time period we acquired a number of companies including the following companies that have a significant impact on our business and are discussed in our notes to consolidated financial statements

 item 1a risk factors tableend we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks many of which are beyond our control in addition to the other information contained in this form 10k the following discussion highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on future results of operations if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted causing the trading price of our common stock to decline in addition these risks and uncertainties may impact the “forwardlooking” statements described elsewhere in this form 10k and in the documents incorporated herein by reference they could affect our actual results of operations causing them to differ materially from those expressed in “forwardlooking” statements 

general economic conditions may affect our net revenue and harm our business 

as our business has expanded globally we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic and political conditions economic growth in the united states slowed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 if economic growth in the united states and other countries’ economies slows or continues to slow in the united states many customers may delay or reduce technology purchases this could result in reductions in sales of our products longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition in addition weakness in the enduser market could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could in turn delay paying their obligations to us which would increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenue on future sales to these customers any of these events would likely harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

our efforts to develop and introduce new product and service offerings expose us to risks such as limited customer acceptance costs related to product defects and large expenditures that may not result in additional net revenue 

rapid technological changes as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences characterize the software industry we are devoting significant resources to the development of technologies like our vertical design products and our digital prototyping and collaboration products in addition we are introducing new business models that require a considerable investment of technical and financial resources such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs or competitors may introduce new products and services that achieve acceptance among our current customers adversely affecting our competitive position in particular a critical component of our growth strategy is to convert our customers of autocad and autocad lt to related vertical industry products and to our 3d modelbased design products such as the autodesk inventor products the revit products autocad civil 3d and navisworks products should sales of autocad autocad upgrades and autocad lt products decrease without a corresponding conversion of customer seats to our 2d vertical products and 3d modelbased design products our results of operations will be adversely affected 

additionally the software products we offer are complex and despite extensive testing and quality control may contain errors or defects these defects or errors could result in the need for corrective releases to our software products damage to our reputation loss of revenue an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products any of which would likely harm our business 

net revenue or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline 

the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including shortfalls in our net revenue earnings or key performance metrics changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors 

  

quarterly variations in our or our competitors’ results of operations developments in our industry unusual events such as significant acquisitions divestitures and litigation and general socioeconomic political or market conditions and other factors including factors unrelated to our operating performance like the current credit issues effecting the economy or the operating performance of our competitors 

in addition significant changes in the price of our common stock could expose the company to additional costly and timeconsuming litigation historically after periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities a company becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management’s attention and resources 

because we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from autocadbased software products if these products are not successful our net revenue will be adversely affected 

we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from sales of licenses of autocad software including products based on autocad that serve specific vertical markets upgrades to those products and products that are interoperable with autocad as such any factor adversely affecting sales of these products including the product release cycle market acceptance product competition performance and reliability reputation price competition economic and market conditions and the availability of thirdparty applications would likely harm our operating results 

our international operations expose us to significant regulatory intellectual property collections currency exchange rate taxation and other risks which could adversely impact our future net revenue and increase our net expenses 

we anticipate that international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue and as we expand our international development expertise will provide significant support to our overall development efforts risks inherent in our international operations include fluctuating currency exchange rates unexpected changes in regulatory practices and tariffs difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales and development operations longer collection cycles for accounts receivable potential changes in tax laws tax arrangements with foreign governments and laws regarding the management of data possible future limitations upon foreign owned businesses and greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property 

our international results will also continue to be impacted by general economic and political conditions in foreign markets generally including conditions in foreign markets resulting from economic and political conditions in the united states these factors may adversely impact our future international operations and consequently our business as a whole 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and economic conditions change and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 

we use derivative instruments to manage a portion of our earnings exposure and cash flow exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as part of our risk management strategy we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage a portion of our exposures of underlying assets liabilities and other obligations which exist as part of our ongoing business operations these foreign currency instruments have maturities of less than three months these instruments provide us with some protection against currency exposures for only the current quarter significant appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies may adversely impact our future net revenue 

  

our investment portfolio is composed of a variety of investment vehicles in a number of countries which are subject to economic factors interest rate trends and market volatility if general economic conditions create a decline in interest rates deterioration in the credit rating of our investments or illiquidity in the financial marketplace we may experience a decline in interest income an inability to sell our investments or an impairment in the value of our investments 

we invest our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities with and in the custody of financial institutions with high credit ratings and limit the amounts invested with any one institution type of security and issuer however we are subject to general economic conditions interest rate trends and volatility in the financial marketplace that can affect the income that we receive from our investments the value of our investments and our ability to sell them in the united states for example if the federal reserve continues to lower interest rates the yields on our portfolio securities may decline any one of these factors could reduce our interest income which in turn could impact our overall net income and earnings per share 

at january 31 2008 we had auction rate securities with an estimated fair value of 84 million 90 million cost basis included in noncurrent “marketable securities” due to their lack of liquidity these aaarated auction rate securities which met our investment guidelines at the time the investments were made have failed to settle at monthly auctions since august 2007 the failed auctions resulted in the interest rate on these investments resetting at a premium as a result of a lack of liquidity for the underlying investment we determined that these securities are temporarily impaired because the securities are fully insured we earn a premium interest rate on the investments the duration of the auction failures are believed to be a temporary market condition and we have the intention and ability to hold the securities until the market value can be realized however in the future if these issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit deteriorates we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the investment through an impairment charge 

if we do not maintain our relationships with the members of our distribution channel or achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough our ability to generate net revenue will be adversely affected 

we sell our software products both directly to customers and through a network of distributors and resellers our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our reseller network computer software distributors and resellers are typically not highly capitalized and have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and may do so in the future while we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of dealers and distributors prior to our sales to them if their financial condition were to deteriorate they might not be able to make repeat purchases we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the united states and international regions including tech data corporation and their affiliates which accounted for 14 of our consolidated net revenue for fiscal 2008 and 12 of our consolidated net revenue for fiscal 2007 over time we have modified and will continue to modify aspects of our relationship with our resellers such as their incentive programs pricing to them and our distribution model to motivate and reward them for aligning their businesses with our strategy and business objectives changes in these relationships and underlying programs could negatively impact their business and harm our business in addition the loss of or a significant reduction in business with those distributors or resellers or the failure to achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough with any one of our major international distributors or large resellers could harm our business in particular if one or more of such resellers were unable to meet their obligations with respect to accounts payable to us we could be forced to write off such accounts and may be required to delay the recognition of revenue on future sales to these customers which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period 

incentives under our partner incentive program and product returns could exceed our estimates and harm our net revenue 

we provide our channel partners incentives through our partner incentive program this is a shortterm plan that uses monetary rewards to motivate distributors and resellers to achieve business goals in a specified time 

  

period the majority of these goals are defined by quarterly targets the majority of our partner incentive reserves reduce license and other revenue in the current period the remainder relates to incentives on our subscription program and reduces deferred revenue in the period the subscription transaction is billed this reduction in deferred revenue results in a reduction of maintenance revenue over the maintenance contract period we also permit our distributors and resellers to return products subject to certain limitations consistent with our experience in fiscal 2008 we anticipate that product returns will continue to be driven by new product releases product update cycles and software quality 

we establish revenue reserves for incentives under our partner incentive program and for product returns partner incentive reserves are based on achievement against purchase quotas for each distributor and reseller we also establish product return reserves based on historical experience estimated channel inventory levels and the timing of new product introductions and other factors while we maintain strict measures to monitor our partner incentive and product return reserves actual incentives or product returns may exceed our reserve estimates and such differences could harm our business 

existing and increased competition may reduce our net revenue and profits 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of desktop computers with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the markets in which we compete are characterized by vigorous competition both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources furthermore a reduction in the number and availability of compatible thirdparty applications may adversely affect the sale of our products because of these and other factors competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future increased competition could result in continued price reductions reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share any of which would likely harm our business 

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer products that compete favorably with respect to reliability performance ease of use range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation and price 

we have been named as a party in lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices and related accounting and we may be named in additional litigation in the future all of which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price for our securities 

three lawsuits have been filed against us and our current officers and certain of our current and former directors and officers relating to our historical stock option practices and related accounting see note 6 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of these proceedings these actions are in the preliminary stages and the ultimate outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price for our securities 

we may become the subject of additional private or government actions in the future including stockholder or employee litigation litigation may be timeconsuming expensive and disruptive to normal business operations and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict the defense of lawsuits may result in significant expenditures and the diversion of our management’s time and attention from the operation of our business which could impede our business all or a portion of any amount we may be required to pay to satisfy a judgment or settlement of any claims may not be covered by insurance 

  

while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “section 404” we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting the report contains among other matters an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 

while we have determined in our management report on internal control over financial reporting included in this form 10k that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 31 2008 we must continue to monitor and assess our internal control over financial reporting if our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and such weakness remains uncorrected at fiscal year end we will be unable to assert such internal control is effective at fiscal year end if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective at fiscal year end or if our independent registered public accounting firm are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which would likely have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 

as more and more software patents are granted worldwide as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows and as the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims infringement or misappropriation claims have in the past been and may in the future be asserted against us and any such assertions could harm our business additionally certain patent holders without products have become more aggressive in threatening and pursuing litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents any such claims or threats whether with or without merit have been and could in the future be timeconsuming to defend result in costly litigation and diversion of resources or could cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in addition such royalty or license agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms if at all which would likely harm our business 

changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business further such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective in particular for fiscal 2007 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 123r “sfas 123r” which requires us to record stockbased compensation charges to earnings for employee stock option grants using a fairvaluebased method for determining such charges we believe that the adoption of sfas 123r will continue to materially adversely impact our earnings and may impact the manner in which we conduct our business 

our business could suffer as a result of risks associated with strategic acquisitions and investments such as the acquisition of navisworks robobat and hanna strategies 

we periodically acquire or invest in businesses software products and technologies that are complementary to our business through strategic alliances equity investments or acquisitions for example we recently 

  

completed the acquisition of navisworks robobat and hanna strategies the risks associated with such acquisitions include among others the difficulty of assimilating the products operations and personnel of the companies the failure to realize anticipated revenue and cost projections the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business in accordance with the requirements of section 404 and the diversion of management’s time and attention in addition such acquisitions and investments may involve significant transaction or integrationrelated costs we may not be successful in overcoming such risks and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business in addition such acquisitions and investments have in the past and may in the future contribute to potential fluctuations in quarterly results of operations the fluctuations could arise from transactionrelated costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or writeoffs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments we also may need to make further investments to support these acquired companies and may have difficulty identifying and acquiring appropriate resources these costs or charges including those relating to the navisworks robobat and hanna strategies acquisitions could negatively impact results of operations for a given period or cause quarter to quarter variability in our operating results 

our operating results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenue and operating results difficult to predict 

our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include the timing of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors slowing of momentum in upgrade or maintenance revenue the adoption of sfas 123r which required us to record compensation expense for shares issued under our stock plans beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 with a negative impact on our results of operations fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates failure to achieve anticipated levels of customer acceptance of key new applications failure to follow sales policies unexpected costs or other operating expenses changes in product pricing or product mix platform changes failure to convert our 2d customer base to 3d modelbased design products timing of product releases and retirements failure to continue momentum of frequent release cycles or to move a significant number of customers from prior product versions in connection with our programs to retire major products unexpected outcomes of matters relating to litigation failure to achieve continued cost reductions and productivity increases unanticipated changes in tax rates and tax laws distribution channel management changes in sales compensation practices the timing of large advanced systems sales failure to effectively implement our copyright legalization programs especially in developing countries failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies failure to achieve sufficient sellthrough in our channels for new or existing products the financial and business condition of our reseller and distribution channels renegotiation or termination of royalty or intellectual property arrangements interruptions or terminations in the business of our consultants or third party developers failure to grow lifecycle management or collaboration products unanticipated impact of accounting for technology acquisitions and general economic conditions particularly in countries where we derive a significant portion of our net revenue 

we have also experienced fluctuations in operating results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic conditions in particular our operating results in europe during the third quarter are usually affected by a slow summer period and the asia pacific operations typically experience seasonal slowing in the third and fourth quarters 

our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenue and are relatively fixed in the short term accordingly any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability greater than anticipated expenses or a failure to maintain rigorous cost controls would also negatively affect profitability further gross margins may be adversely affected if our sales of autocad lt upgrades and advanced systems products which historically have had lower margins grow at a faster rate than sales of our highermargin products 

  

we cannot accurately predict customer subscription attach and renewal rates and the impact these attach and renewal rates will have on our future revenue or operating results 

our maintenance customers have no obligation to attach maintenance to their initial license or renew their maintenance subscriptions after the expiration of their initial subscription period which is typically one year our customers’ attachment and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors if our customers do not attach maintenance to their initial license or renew their subscriptions for our products then our maintenance revenue will decline and our business will suffer 

we rely on third party technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies our product and service development may be delayed 

we rely on certain software that we license from third parties including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions these thirdparty software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and the software may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software could be developed identified licensed and integrated which would likely harm our business 

we are investing resources in updating and improving our internal information technology systems should our investments not succeed or if delays or other issues with a new internal technology system disrupt our operations our business would be harmed 

we rely on our network and data center infrastructure internal technology systems and our websites for our development marketing operational support and sales activities we are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet the growing requirements of our business and customers for example in november 2007 we converted from two order entry systems to a single order entry system the objectives of this conversion were to improve the efficiency of operations for autodesk and our resellers unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in disruption in our business operations loss of revenue or damage to our reputation 

disruptions with licensing relationships and third party developers could adversely impact our business 

we license certain key technologies from third parties licenses may be restricted in the term or the use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business similarly we may not be able to obtain or renew license agreements for key technology on favorable terms if at all and any failure to do so could harm our business 

our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with thirdparty developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn in particular markets such disruption would likely negatively impact these thirdparty developers and end users which could harm our business 

additionally technology created by outsourced product development whether outsourced to third parties or developed externally and transferred to us through business or technology acquisitions have certain additional risks these risks including potential difficulties with effective integration into existing products adequate transfer of technology knowhow and ownership and protection of transferred intellectual property 

  

as a result of our strategy of partnering with other companies for product development our product delivery schedules could be adversely affected if we experience difficulties with our product development partners 

we partner with certain independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities we believe our partnering strategy allows us to among other things achieve efficiencies in developing new products and maintaining and enhancing existing product offerings our partnering strategy creates a dependency on such independent developers independent developers including those who currently develop products for us in the united states and throughout the world may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future in addition use of development resources through consulting relationships particularly in nonus jurisdictions with developing legal systems may be adversely impacted by and expose us to risks relating to evolving employment export and intellectual property laws these risks could among other things expose our intellectual property to misappropriation and result in disruptions to product delivery schedules 

our business would be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel 

our success depends largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial sales and marketing personnel competition for these personnel is intense the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions 

if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights our business could be harmed 

we rely on a combination of patents copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software products or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our software products is timeconsuming and costly while we have recovered some revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists and software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem furthermore our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop similar technology

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend on august 26 2005 telstra corporation limited “telstra” filed suit in the federal court of australia victoria district registry against autodesk australia pty ltd “aapl” seeking partial indemnification for claims filed against telstra by spatialinfo pty limited relating to telstra’s use of certain software in the management of its computer based cable plant records system on december 12 2005 spatialinfo added aapl as a defendant to its lawsuit against telstra in february 2008 the parties agreed to settle all outstanding claims and dismiss the action the final resolution of the litigation did not have a material effect on autodesk’s results of operations cash flows or financial position in a particular period 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 three stockholder derivative lawsuits were filed against autodesk and certain of the company’s current and former directors and officers relating to its historical stock option practices and related accounting on november 20 2006 the company and certain of its current and former members of the board were sued in united states federal district court for the northern district of california in a stockholder derivative action entitled “giles v bartz et al” case no c068175 the “giles case” on december 29 2006 the company certain of its current and former members of the board and certain current and past executive officers were sued in united states federal district court for the northern district of california in a stockholder derivative action entitled “campion v sutton et al” case no c0607967 this lawsuit was consolidated into the previously mentioned giles case and later voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff on january 31 2007 on january 9 2007 the company certain of its current and former members of the board and certain current and former executive officers were sued in the superior court for the state of california county of marin in a stockholder derivative action entitled “koerner v bartz et al” case no cv070112 the “koerner case” the plaintiff in the giles case filed an amended and restated complaint on december 3 2007 and the plaintiff in the koerner case filed an amended and restated complaint on december 7 2007 autodesk cannot determine the final financial impact of these matters based on the facts known at this time however it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of the matters could occur and materially affect its future results of operations cash flows or financial position in a particular period 

in connection with autodesk’s antipiracy program designed to enforce copyright protection of the company’s software and conducted both internally and through the business software alliance “bsa” from time to time autodesk undertakes litigation against alleged copyright infringers or provides information to criminal justice authorities to conduct actions against alleged copyright infringers such lawsuits have led to counter claims alleging improper use of litigation or violation of other local law and have recently increased in frequency especially in latin america 

in addition autodesk is involved in legal proceedings from time to time arising from the normal course of business activities including claims of alleged infringement of intellectual property rights commercial employment piracy prosecution and other matters in the company’s opinion resolution of pending matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations cash flows or its financial position however it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more such proceedings could in the future materially affect its future results of operations cash flows or financial position in a particular period

 dividends 

we did not declare any cash or stock dividends in either fiscal 2008 or fiscal 2007 we anticipate that for the foreseeable future we will retain any earnings for use in the operation of our business 

stockholders 

as of january 31 2008 the number of common stockholders of record was 640 because many of our shares of common stock are held by brokers or other institutions on behalf of stockholders we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by the record holders 

issuer purchases of equity securities 

the purpose of autodesk’s stock repurchase program is to help offset the dilution to net income per share caused by the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans as well as to more effectively utilize excess cash generated from our business the number of shares acquired and the timing of the purchases are based on several factors including the level of our cash balances general business and market conditions the market price of our stock and other investment opportunities at january 31 2008 241 million shares remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization see note 7 “stockholders’ equity” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the discussion in our mda contains trend analyses and other forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 forwardlooking statements are any statements that look to future events and consist of among other things our business strategies anticipated future operating results including net revenue product backlog upgrade crossgrade and maintenance revenue the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates on net revenue and expenses costs and expenses including cost of revenue and operating expenses future income our anticipated tax rate planned product retirement and annual release cycle in addition forwardlooking statements also consist of statements involving expectations regarding product acceptance continuation of our stock repurchase program and shortterm and longterm cash requirements as well as statements involving trend analyses and statements including such words as “may” “believe” “could” “anticipate” “would” “might” “plan” “expect” and similar expressions or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology these forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date of this annual report on form 10k and are subject to business and economic risks as such our actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements as a result of the factors set forth above in item 1a “risk factors” and in our other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission we assume no obligation to update the forwardlooking statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made 

strategy 

our goal is to be the world’s leading 2d and 3d design software and services company for the architecture engineering construction manufacturing geospatial mapping and digital media markets our focus is to offer our customers the ability to visualize simulate and analyze realworld performance early in the design process to foster innovation enhance quality and save time and money worldwide business trends such as globalization sustainability investment in infrastructure and the price of oil are creating pressure on our customers to increase innovation while improving productivity our customers are seeking differentiation through design and we believe our products provide a competitive advantage to succeed in this environment 

we believe that our ability to make technology available to mainstream markets is one of our competitive advantages by innovating in existing technology categories we bring powerful design products to volume markets our products are designed to be easy to learn and use and to provide customers low cost of deployment low total cost of ownership and a rapid return on investment in addition our software architecture allows for extensibility and integration 

we have created a large global community of resellers thirdparty developers and customers which provides us with a broad reach into volume markets our reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with global resources for the purchase and support of our products as well as resources for effective and cost efficient training services we have a significant number of registered thirdparty developers creating products that operate with our software products further extending our reach into volume markets users trained on our products are broadly available both from universities and the existing work force reducing the cost of training for our customers to train the next generation of users we offer education programs including classroom support standardized curricula instructor development and specially priced softwarepurchasing options 

our growth strategy derives from these core strengths we continue to increase the business value of our desktop design tools in a number of ways we improve the performance and functionality of existing products with each new release our most recent product release commenced in march 2008 beyond our 2d horizontal design products we develop products addressing industryspecific needs including 2d vertical and 3d modelbased products we continually strive to improve our product functionality and specialization by industry while increasing product interoperability and usability by doing this we drive technology democratization and increase customer loyalty 

  

in addition we believe that migration of our customers from our 2d horizontal products to our 2d vertical products and 3d modelbased design products presents a significant growth opportunity for fiscal 2008 revenue from 3d modelbased design products increased 26 as compared to the prior fiscal year and autodesk shipped more than 159300 commercial seats which includes new seats and crossgrade seats of 3d modelbased design products including 76400 seats of revit 52500 seats of autodesk inventor and 30400 seats of autocad civil 3d while the rate of migration to 2d vertical products and 3d modelbased design products varies from industry to industry adoption of 2d vertical products and 3d modelbased design software should increase the productivity of our customers in all industries and result in richer design data however this migration also poses various risks to us in particular if we do not successfully convert our 2d horizontal customer base to our 2d vertical products and 3d modelbased design products as expected sales of our 2d horizontal products may decrease without a corresponding increase in customer seats of our 2d vertical products and 3d modelbased design products we would not realize the growth we expect and our business would be adversely affected 

expanding our geographic coverage is a key element of our growth strategy we believe that rapidly growing emerging economies present significant growth opportunities for us in fiscal 2008 revenue from emerging economies increased 40 as compared to fiscal 2007 revenue from emerging economies represented 17 of fiscal 2008 net revenue as compared 14 of fiscal 2007 net revenue conducting business in these emerging economies presents significant challenges including intellectual property protection and software piracy which remain substantial problems 

another significant part of our growth strategy is to continue to move customers to our subscription program we strive to sell subscription contracts to all new customers migrate existing upgrade customers to subscription contracts and renew subscription contracts with existing subscription customers this business model results in a more efficient sales process than our traditional upgrade process and reduces volatility in our revenue moving customers to our subscription program ensures that we have more customers on current versions of our products increases customer loyalty and increases the likelihood that they will migrate to our 3d modelbased design products all revenue from our subscription program is maintenance revenue on our consolidated statements of income maintenance revenue grew 31 in fiscal 2008 as compared to growth of 54 in the prior fiscal year our subscription base has grown substantially over the past several years and now consists of nearly 15 million users as a result while we expect growth in maintenance revenue from our subscription program in the future to continue to be strong we expect the growth rate to be lower than in the past 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we regularly reevaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition our accounting policies and practices are in compliance with statement of position 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended and sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” 

  

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 

for multiple element arrangements that include software products we allocate the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on their vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value vsoe is the price charged when an element is sold separately or a price set by management with the relevant authority if we do not have vsoe of the undelivered element we defer revenue recognition on the entire sales arrangement until all elements are delivered we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 

our assessment of likelihood of collection is also a critical factor in determining the timing of revenue recognition if we do not believe that collection is probable the revenue will be deferred until the earlier of when collection is deemed probable or payment is received 

our product license revenue from distributors and resellers are generally recognized at the time title to our product passes to the distributor or reseller provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met this policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns among other criteria we are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers our policy also presumes that we have no significant performance obligations in connection with the sale of our product licenses by our distributors and resellers to their customers if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

product returns reserves we permit our distributors and resellers to return products up to a percentage of prior quarter purchases the product returns reserve is based on historical experience of actual product returns estimated channel inventory levels the timing of new product introductions and promotions channel sellin for applicable markets and other factors 

our product returns reserves were 144 million at january 31 2008 and 182 million at january 31 2007 product returns as a percentage of applicable revenue were 35 in fiscal 2008 39 in fiscal 2007 and 37 in fiscal 2006 during fiscal year 2008 and 2007 we recorded additions to our product returns reserves of 436 million and 571 million respectively which reduced our revenue while we believe our accounting practice for establishing and monitoring product returns reserves is adequate and appropriate any adverse activity or unusual circumstances could result in an increase in reserve levels in the period in which such determinations are made 

partner incentive reserves autodesk has a partner incentive program that uses quarterly attainment monetary rewards to motivate distributors and resellers to achieve mutually agreed upon business goals in a specified time period a portion of these reserves reduce license and other revenue in the current period the remainder which relates to incentives on our subscription program reduces deferred revenue in the period the subscription transaction is billed which results in a reduction to maintenance revenue over the maintenance contract period partner incentive reserves were 412 million and 283 million at january 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

realizability of longlived assets we assess the realizability of our longlived assets and related intangible assets other than goodwill annually during the fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review significant underperformance of a business or product line relative to budget shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends and the results of past impairment reviews 

  

in assessing the recoverability of these longlived assets we first determine their fair values which are based on assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows that could reasonably be generated by these assets when assessing longlived assets we use undiscounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows because expected lives are relatively short discounting the projected cash flows would not lead to a significantly different result variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of the impairment charge impairment charges if any result in situations where the fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values 

in addition to our recoverability assessments we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our longlived assets any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made as well as in subsequent quarters 

we will continue to evaluate the values of our longlived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

goodwill we test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment when assessing goodwill for impairment we use discounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether goodwill assets are impaired or the amount of the impairment charge impairment charges if any result from instances where the fair values of net assets associated with goodwill are less than their carrying values as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

income taxes we currently have 1494 million of net deferred tax assets mostly arising from net operating losses including stock option deductions taken in fiscal years prior to fiscal 2007 tax credits nondeductible accruals and timing differences for purchased technologies and capitalized software offset by the establishment of us deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries we perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets which is principally dependent upon our achievement of projected future taxable income of approximately 408 million across a specific mix of geographies our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors these changes if any may require possible material adjustments to these net deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determinations are made 

autodesk is a us based multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions our effective tax rate is based on expected geographic mix of earnings statutory rates intercompany transfer pricing and enacted tax rules significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis we believe our tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business it is possible that these positions may be challenged which may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 

we adopted fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” on february 1 2007 the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease in the future for various reasons such as current year tax positions expiration of statutes of limitations litigation legislative activity or other changes in facts regarding realizability 

sharebased compensation  in december 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123—revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” which replaces statement of financial accounting standards no 123 “sfas 123” and supersedes apb 25 sfas 123r requires the measurement of all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options using a fairvalue based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of income 

  

we adopted sfas 123r using the modified prospective transition method which requires the application of the accounting standard as of february 1 2006 the first day of our fiscal year 2007 our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2008 and 2007 reflect our adoption of sfas 123r in accordance with the modified prospective transition method our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated for and do not include the impact of compensation expense calculated under sfas 123r 

sfas 123r requires companies to estimate the fair value of sharebased payment awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of income prior to the adoption of sfas 123r we accounted for stockbased awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb 25 as permitted by sfas 123 under the intrinsic value method compensation expense resulted primarily from stock option grants to nonexecutive employees at exercise prices below fair market value on the option measurement date the majority of these grants were made between august 2000 and february 2005 

we use the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model for determining the estimated fair value for employee stock awards this is the same optionpricing model used in prior years to calculate the pro forma compensation expense under our sfas 123 footnote disclosures this model requires the input of assumptions including expected stock price volatility expected life expected dividend yield and riskfree interest rate of each award the parameters used in the model are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted as needed compensation expense for employee stock awards is recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period of the award the adoption of sfas 123r also requires certain changes to the accounting for income taxes the method used in determining diluted shares the application of a prevesting forfeiture rate against both preand postadoption grants as well as additional disclosure related to the cash flow effects resulting from sharebased compensation 

legal contingencies  as described in part i item 3 “legal proceedings” and part ii item 8 note 6 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations 

recently issued accounting standards 

in december 2007 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” “sfas 141r” sfas 141r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired sfas 141r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination this statement will be effective for autodesk’s fiscal year beginning february 1 2009 autodesk is currently evaluating the impact that sfas 141r will have on its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in december 2007 the fasb also issued statement of financial accounting standards no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements—an amendment of arb no 51” “sfas 160” sfas 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest changes in a parent’s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated sfas 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and 

  

distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners this statement will be effective for autodesk’s fiscal year beginning february 1 2009 autodesk does not believe the adoption of sfas 160 will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in february 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities—including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” “sfas 159” which expands the use of fair value measurement by permitting entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates this statement is required to be adopted by autodesk as of february 1 2008 autodesk does not believe the adoption of sfas 159 will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but instead is intended to eliminate inconsistencies with respect to this topic found in various other accounting pronouncements this statement is effective as of february 1 2008 for autodesk’s 2009 fiscal year including interim periods within our 2009 fiscal year with the exception of a one year deferral for the implementation of the statement for other nonfinancial assets and liabilities autodesk does not believe the adoption of sfas 157 will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

overview of fiscal 2008 results of operations 

 

 the primary goals for fiscal 2008 were to continue our delivery of marketleading products and solutions to our customers and to drive revenue growth and increases in operating margins and operating cash flow during fiscal 2008 we released our 2008 family of products offering our customers continued advancements in design and authoring productivity as well as digital prototyping and product lifecycle management capabilities during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 net revenue increased 18 income from operations increased 27 and operating cash flow increased 23 

net revenue for fiscal 2008 increased due to an increase in license and other revenue of 14 and an increase in maintenance revenue from our subscription program of 31 net revenue for our 2d products and 3d modelbased design products increased 13 and 26 respectively during fiscal 2008 as compared to the prior fiscal year a critical component of our growth strategy is to continue to add new 2d horizontal users while migrating our customers to our higher value 2d vertical and 3d modelbased design products 

our total operating margin increased from 19 of net revenue in fiscal 2007 to 21 in fiscal 2008 this improvement is primarily due to an increase in our media and entertainment segment’s operating income by 342 million in fiscal 2008 compared to the prior fiscal year the increase in operating income from our media and entertainment segment was due to higher gross margins from advanced systems resulting from a shift to sales of our linuxbased systems a shift to system sales comprised of more software and less hardware and a 22 increase in net revenue from our animation products these increases were partially offset by an increase in 

  

amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles of 113 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 we continue to invest in growth and productivity initiatives and over the longer term we intend to continue to balance investments in revenue growth opportunities with our goal of increasing our operating margins our operating margins are very sensitive to changes in revenue given the relatively fixed nature of most of our expenses which consist primarily of employeerelated expenditures facilities costs and depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal 2009 we expect total costs and expenses to increase in absolute dollars but decline slightly as a percentage of net revenue resulting in overall operating margin improvement as compared to fiscal 2008 we will continue to balance investments in revenue growth opportunities with our focus on increasing profitability 

we generate a significant amount of our revenue in the united states japan germany united kingdom italy france canada china south korea and australia the weaker value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies had a positive effect of 474 million on operating income in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 had exchange rates from fiscal 2007 been in effect during fiscal 2008 translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been 712 million lower and operating expenses would have been 238 million lower foreign currencies had a minimal effect on financial results for fiscal 2007 changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue in future periods we use foreign currency option collar contracts to reduce a portion of the current quarter exchange rate effect on the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions 

throughout fiscal 2008 we maintained a strong balance sheet generating 7085 million of cash from operating activities as compared to 5766 million during the previous fiscal year we finished fiscal 2008 with 9577 million in cash and marketable securities of which 84 million is classified as longterm this is an increase from the 7779 million balance at january 31 2007 we managed to achieve this increase while repurchasing 121 million shares of our common stock and continuing to invest in our business through acquisitions including robobat navisworks and hanna strategies and investments in other growth initiatives comparatively during the prior fiscal year we repurchased 42 million shares of our common stock completed the acquisition of constructware and invested in a 28 interest in hanna strategies we completed fiscal 2008 with a higher deferred revenue balance and higher accounts receivable balance as compared to the previous fiscal year our deferred revenue balance at january 31 2008 included 4338 million of customer maintenance contracts related to our subscription program which will be recognized as maintenance revenue ratably over the life of the contracts which is predominantly one year 

  

results of operations 

net revenue 

 

 fiscal 2008 net revenue compared to fiscal 2007 net revenue 

license and other revenue 

license and other revenue are comprised of two components all forms of product license revenue and other revenue product license revenue includes revenue from the sale of new seats revenue from the autodesk upgrade program and revenue from the autodesk crossgrade program other revenue consists of revenue from consulting and training services revenue from the autodesk developers network autodesk collaborative solution hosting revenue autodesk’s location services division and revenue from advanced systems product support 

growth in license and other revenue during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to growth in new seat revenue for most major products driven by the release of our 2008 family of products total license and other revenue increased 14 for fiscal 2008 as compared to the prior fiscal year as a percentage of total net revenue license and other revenue was 75 for fiscal 2008 77 for fiscal 2007 and 82 for fiscal 2006 

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including tech data corporation and its affiliates who accounted for 14 12 and 11 of autodesk’s consolidated net revenue for fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  

during fiscal 2008 we made changes to our partner incentive programs to incent our valueadded resellers to shift their focus to selling 2d vertical products and 3d modelbased design products these new programs which are accounted for as a reduction to net revenue drive a consistent treatment of incentives around the world by further reallocating incentives from our 2d horizontal products autocad and autocad lt to 2d vertical and 3d modelbased design products we believe that changes to our partner incentive programs are having the intended effect of shifting our resellers’ focus to selling 2d vertical and 3d modelbased design products 

revenue from the sale of new seats increased 19 from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 the increase is due to an 18 increase in revenue from new seats of our 2d products primarily autocad lt autocad autocad mechanical and autocad architecture the increase was also due to a 30 increase in revenue from new seats of our 3d modelbased design products revit products autodesk inventor products autocad civil 3d and navisworks software the increase in new seat revenue was driven primarily by higher average sales prices per seat and volume growth in both our 2d design and 3d modelbased design products 

the positive effect of the weaker value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies also contributed to the increase in total net revenue in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 in addition we experienced growth in net revenue in all three of our geographic regions and strong growth in the emerging economies of europe middle east africa and asia pacific 

upgrade revenue which includes crossgrade revenue decreased by 17 during fiscal 2008 as compared to the prior fiscal year as expected the decrease in upgrade revenue was driven primarily from the relatively smaller size of the upgradeable base of our autocadbased products in fiscal 2008 as compared to the upgradeable base of our autocadbased products in fiscal 2007 due to more customers on our subscription program in addition during the second half of fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 autocad lt customers could crossgrade to any other product at a promotional rate which contributed approximately 91 million to upgrade revenue in fiscal 2008 as compared to 214 million in fiscal 2007 we expect revenue from upgrades to continue to decline as we continue to execute on our strategy of moving customers to our subscription program 

revenue from the sales of services training and support included in “license and other” are immaterial for all periods presented 

maintenance revenue 

maintenance revenue consists of revenue derived from our subscription program under this program customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades whenandifavailable downloadable training courses and online support we recognize maintenance revenue from our subscription program ratably over the maintenance contract periods maintenance revenue increased 31 for fiscal 2008 as compared to the prior fiscal year as a percentage of total net revenue maintenance revenue was 25 for fiscal 2008 23 for fiscal 2007 and 18 for fiscal 2006 our subscription program available to most customers worldwide continues to attract new and renewal customers by providing them with a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of our new product releases and enhancements we expect maintenance revenue to continue to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenue as a result of increased subscription program enrollment which is now at nearly 15 million users however we expect these growth rates to be lower than in the past this shift away from upgrades toward a more predictable and sustainable maintenance revenue stream from the subscription program is consistent with our longterm strategy 

due to the increase in our subscription base over time the relative upgradeable installed base of the autocadbased products not on subscription during fiscal 2008 was smaller than the upgradeable installed base of the autocadbased products not on subscription during fiscal 2007 maintenance revenue from subscriptions substantially exceeded revenue from upgrades in fiscal 2008 

aggregate backlog at january 31 2008 and january 31 2007 was 5215 million and 3958 million respectively of which 5061 million and 3788 million represented deferred revenue and 154 million and 

  

170 million respectively related to current software license product orders which have not yet shipped at the end of each respective fiscal year deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred maintenance revenue from our subscription program to a lesser extent deferred revenue consists of deferred license and other revenue derived from autodesk buzzsaw and autodesk constructware services consulting services and deferred license sales backlog from current software license product orders which we have not yet shipped consists of orders for currently available license software products from customers with approved credit status and may include orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period 

net revenue by geographic area 

net revenue in the americas region increased by 9 during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to a 22 increase in maintenance revenue from our subscription program revenue from new seats in the americas increased 2 during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 driven by new seat revenue from our 3d modelbased design products offset by a decline in new seat revenue from our 2d products compared to the prior fiscal year revenue from upgrades decreased by 14 in the americas during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior fiscal year growth in the americas was also impacted by a slowing economy that impacted growth rates for all of our products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 had exchange rates during fiscal 2007 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2008 translated net revenue in the americas would have been 01 million lower in fiscal 2008 

net revenue in the europe middle east and africa “emea” region increased by 27 during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to a 37 increase in new seat revenue and 40 increase in maintenance revenue from our subscription program revenue from new seats in emea increased during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 driven by new seat revenue from our 2d design products and 3d modelbased design products these increases were partially offset by 24 decrease in revenue from upgrades emea’s growth during fiscal 2008 was primarily due to growth in the local emerging economies and the united kingdom germany france belgium and austria had exchange rates during fiscal 2007 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2008 translated net revenue in emea would have been 667 million lower in fiscal 2008 

net revenue in the asia pacific “apac” region increased 18 during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to an 18 increase in new seats revenue a 32 increase in maintenance revenue from our subscription program and a 9 increase in revenue from upgrades revenue from new seats in apac increased due to strong new seat revenue from our 2d products and 3d modelbased design products net revenue growth in apac during fiscal 2008 occurred primarily due to growth in the local emerging economies japan south korea and australia had exchange rates during fiscal 2007 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2008 translated net revenue in apac would have been 44 million lower in fiscal 2008 

we believe that international net revenue will continue to comprise a majority of our total net revenue economic weakness in any of the countries that contributes a significant portion of our net revenue could have an adverse effect on our business in those countries changes in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could significantly affect our future financial results for a given period international net revenue represented 69 of our net revenue in fiscal 2008 and 66 of our net revenue in fiscal 2007 net revenue in emerging economies grew by 40 from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 primarily due to revenue from the emea emerging economies china and india this growth was a significant factor in our international sales growth during fiscal 2008 

net revenue by operating segment 

net revenue for the design solutions segment increased 19 during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to a 21 increase in new seat revenue and a 32 increase in maintenance revenue from our subscription program these increases were partially offset by a 17 decrease in upgrade revenue in fiscal 2008 

  

as compared to fiscal 2007 maintenance revenue increased to 26 of design solutions segment revenue during fiscal 2008 compared to 24 in fiscal 2007 

net revenue for the media and entertainment segment increased 10 during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 during fiscal 2008 net revenue from our animation business line increased 22 due to increases in revenue from our animation products 3ds max and maya net revenue growth from advanced systems was flat as compared to the prior fiscal year due to the migration of our advanced systems solutions from sgi hardware to pcbased hardware systems which have a lower price but generate better margins 

fiscal 2007 net revenue compared to fiscal 2006 net revenue 

license and other revenue 

the 12 increase in net revenue during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was due to an increase in sales of new seats an increase in the sales of subscription contracts which are recognized as maintenance revenue and an increase in crossgrade revenue revenue from the sale of new seats increased due to volume growth and higher average sales prices in our autocad autocad lt and our 3d modelbased design products in addition the introduction of our maya and studiotools products resulting from the january 2006 acquisition of alias contributed to the growth in revenue during fiscal 2007 we experienced strong growth in all three of our geographic regions and strong growth rates in the emerging economies of asia pacific eastern europe and the middle east and latin america from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 these increases were partially offset by a decline in revenue from upgrades resulting primarily from the relatively smaller size of the upgradeable base of our autocadbased products during fiscal 2007 compared to the upgradeable base of our autocadbased products as of the same period in the prior fiscal year 

growth in license and other revenue during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily due to an increase in the sale of commercial new seats for most major products driven by our new product releases during fiscal 2007 the 19 increase in revenue from the sale of new seats from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was driven by volume growth in autocad autocad lt and most major products as well as growing sales of our 3d modelbased design products these increases were partially offset by a 7 decrease in revenue from upgrades driven by the relatively smaller size of the upgradeable base of our autocadbased products in fiscal 2007 compared to the size of the upgradeable base of our autocadbased products in fiscal 2006 and the success of our subscription program in fiscal 2006 revenue from the sales of services training and support are immaterial for all periods presented 

maintenance revenue 

maintenance revenue from our subscription program increased 54 for fiscal 2007 as compared to the prior fiscal year as a percentage of total net revenue maintenance revenue was 23 for fiscal 2007 and 18 for fiscal 2006 the upgradeable installed base of the autocadbased products not on subscription during fiscal 2007 was smaller than the upgradeable installed base of autocadbased products not on subscription during fiscal 2006 as a result overall maintenance revenue from subscriptions exceeded revenue from upgrades in fiscal 2007 

deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred maintenance revenue from our subscription program to a lesser extent deferred revenue consists of deferred license and other revenue derived from autodesk buzzsaw and autodesk constructware services consulting services and deferred license sales backlog from current software license product orders which we have not yet shipped consists of orders for currently available license software products from customers with approved credit status and may include orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period aggregate backlog at january 31 2007 and january 31 2006 was 3958 million and 2835 million respectively of which 170 million for both fiscal years related to current software license product orders which have not yet shipped at the end of each respective fiscal year 

  

we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including tech data corporation and their affiliates who accounted for 12 of fiscal 2007 net revenue and 11 of fiscal 2006 net revenue 

net revenue by geographic area 

net revenue in the americas region increased 18 during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to strong maintenance revenue as well as revenue from products acquired in our acquisition of alias in january 2006 and from growth in revenue from sales of new seats driven by new product releases during fiscal 2007 revenue from upgrades in the americas declined by 4 during fiscal 2007 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year had exchange rates during fiscal 2006 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2007 translated net revenue would have been lower by 03 million in fiscal 2007 

net revenue in the emea region increased 23 during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to an increase in the sale of new seats resulting from new product releases combined with a strong increase in maintenance revenue and revenue from new products acquired from alias revenue from upgrades in emea experienced a 2 decline from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 emea’s strong growth during fiscal 2007 was primarily due to growth in the local emerging economies germany the united kingdom france and italy had exchange rates during fiscal 2006 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2007 translated net revenue would have been lower by 103 million in fiscal 2007 

net revenue in the apac region increased 17 during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to strong growth in revenue from sales of new seats resulting from new product releases followed by strong growth in maintenance revenue revenue from upgrades in apac declined by 29 during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 net revenue growth in apac during fiscal 2007 primarily occurred in china south korea australia and india the increase in apac net revenue during fiscal 2007 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year was also due to revenue from new products acquired from alias this revenue growth was offset by significant declines in the net revenue growth in japan for 2d and 3d products had exchange rates for fiscal 2006 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2007 translated net revenue in the apac region would have been higher by 97 million in fiscal 2007 

international net revenue represented 66 of our net revenue in both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 net revenue in emerging economies grew by 39 from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 primarily due to revenue from china india emea emerging economies and latin america this growth was a significant factor in our international sales growth during fiscal 2007 had exchange rates during fiscal 2006 been in effect during the same period of fiscal 2007 translated international revenue would have been 10 million lower in fiscal 2007 

net revenue by operating segment 

net revenue for the design solutions segment increased 19 during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to a 20 increase in new seat revenue and a 48 increase in maintenance from our subscription program these increases were partially offset by a 6 decrease in revenue from upgrades in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 maintenance revenue from our subscription program increased to 24 of design solutions segment revenue during fiscal 2007 compared to 20 in fiscal 2006 sales of autocad and autocad lt continued to comprise a significant portion of our net revenue such sales reflected in the net revenue for the platform solutions and emerging business division and other represented 40 of net revenue in fiscal 2007 and 43 of consolidated net revenue in the same period of the prior fiscal year increasing 11 in absolute dollars between the periods net revenue for our 3d modelbased design products autodesk inventor products revit products and autocad civil 3d increased 41 during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 total sales of 3d modelbased design products represented 22 of consolidated net revenue in fiscal 2007 compared to 18 in fiscal 2006 

  

net revenue for the media and entertainment segment increased during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily from revenue increases in our animation business line from both our january 2006 acquisition of alias and the introduction of new versions of 3ds max and maya products during the second quarter of fiscal 2007 although net revenue from advanced systems sales did not increase significantly during fiscal 2007 compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year such sales progressively improved during each quarter of fiscal 2007 as a result of substantial progress made in the transition of our advanced systems product portfolio from sgi hardware to pcbased hardware systems 

cost of revenue 

 

 cost of license and other revenue includes direct material and overhead charges labor costs of fulfilling service contracts and order processing royalties amortization of purchased technology and stockbased compensation expense under sfas 123r direct material and overhead charges include the cost of hardware sold mainly pcbased workstations for advanced systems in the media and entertainment segment in fiscal 2008 and sgi hardware for advanced systems in the media and entertainment segment in fiscal 2007 and 2006 costs associated with transferring our software to electronic media printing of user manuals and packaging materials and shipping and handling costs 

cost of license and other revenue decreased 5 during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 due primarily to a shift in advanced systems from sgi hardware to pcbased hardware the increase in cost of license and other revenue during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily due to higher amortization of purchased technology resulting from recent acquisitions and stockbased compensation expense under sfas 123r which together represented 1 of revenue 

cost of maintenance revenue includes costs of sales associated with maintenance under our subscription program costs of maintenance revenue remained relatively flat during fiscal 2008 as compared to the prior fiscal year the decrease in cost of maintenance revenue during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was due primarily to the cessation of amortization for an information technology system supporting our subscription program which became fully amortized during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and which was retired from operation in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 the amortization reduction was partially offset by incremental direct program costs incurred as part of the growth of our subscription program 

cost of revenue at least over the near term is affected by the volume and mix of product sales changing consulting costs software amortization costs royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products new customer support offerings and the effect of expensing employee stockbased compensation expense we expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 

  

marketing and sales 

 

 marketing and sales expenses include salaries benefits and bonuses for our marketing and sales employees travel and facility costs for our marketing sales dealer training and support stockbased compensation expense under sfas 123r for stock awards granted to marketing and sales employees labor costs of order processing dealer and sales commissions and overhead charges these expenses also include costs of programs aimed at increasing revenue such as advertising trade shows and expositions and various sales and promotional programs designed for specific sales channels and end users 

marketing and sales expense increased 21 during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to 955 million of higher employeerelated costs driven by increased marketing and sales headcount and increased commissions and commission accelerators from higher revenue in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 the increase was also due to 185 million of increased marketing and promotion costs related to product launches trade shows branding and demand generation 

the increase of marketing and sales expenses during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily due primarily to a 558 million increase in employeerelated costs driven by increased marketing and sales headcount 419 million of stockbased compensation expense due to the adoption of sfas 123r in fiscal 2007 and 296 million of increased marketing and promotion costs related to product launches trade shows branding and demand generation marketing and sales headcount increased as a result of organic growth as well as the acquisition of alias 

we expect to continue to invest in marketing and sales of our products to develop market opportunities to promote our competitive position and to strengthen our channel support as a result we expect marketing and sales expense to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 

research and development 

 

 research and development expenses which are expensed as incurred consist primarily of salaries benefits and bonuses for software engineers fees paid to software development firms and independent contractors stockbased compensation expense under sfas 123r for stock awards granted to research and development employees overhead charges purchased inprocess technology and depreciation of computer equipment used in software development 

research and development expenses increased 19 during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to an increase in employee related costs of 332 million driven by increased research and 

  

development headcount and an 116 million increase in consulting services and inprocess technology purchases from hanna strategies also contributing to the increase in research and development expenses was 55 million of inprocess research and development from acquisitions during fiscal 2008 additionally in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we accelerated certain internal product development initiatives that increased research and development costs 

during fiscal 2008 we incurred a total of approximately 383 for consulting services and inprocess technology purchases from hanna strategies compared to 267 million in the prior year the cost of the inprocess technology acquired from hanna strategies was immediately recognized as an expense because the technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we acquired the remaining 72 ownership interest in hanna strategies for net consideration of 135 million see note 14 “related parties” in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this acquisition 

the increase in research and development expenses during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from an increase in wages and salaries driven by an increase in headcount of 554 million and the recognition of 301 million of stockbased compensation expense due to the adoption of sfas 123r during fiscal 2007 during fiscal 2007 we incurred a total of approximately 267 for consulting services and inprocess technology purchases from hanna strategies compared to 270 million in the prior year during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we also acquired a 28 ownership interest in hanna strategies for cash consideration of 125 million 

overall we have increased our investment in research and development during fiscal 2008 as compared to the prior fiscal year to create new products and new versions of existing products broader interoperability accelerated localization efforts and improvements in visualization simulation and analysis we expect research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 as we continue to invest in product development and acquire new technology in fiscal 2009 

general and administrative 

 

 general and administrative expenses include salaries benefits and bonuses for our finance human resources and legal personnel as well as professional fees for legal and accounting services overhead costs stockbased compensation expense under sfas 123r for stock awards granted to general and administrative employees litigation costs and amortization expense of customer relationships and trademarks acquired 

general and administrative expenses increased 12 from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 primarily due to a 196 million increase in employee related costs due to an increase in general and administrative headcount the 33 increase in general and administrative expenses from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was primarily due to the recognition of 169 million of stockbased compensation expense as a result of the adoption of fas 123r and a 79 million increase in employeerelated costs due to an increase in general and administrative headcount general and administrative headcount increased as a result of organic growth we expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008

the following table sets forth the components of interest and other income net 

 

 investment income fluctuates based on average cash and marketable securities balances average maturities and interest rates the increase in interest and investment income net during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 reflects proportionately higher cash balances and interest rate yields during the fiscal 2008 the increase in interest and investment income net during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 reflects proportionately higher interest rate yields during 2007 when compared with 2006 the increase in interest and investment income net for fiscal 2008 was partially offset by a loss on a cost method investment and an impairment of our 28 equity investment in hanna strategies 

our 28 ownership interest in hanna strategies accounted for under accounting principles board opinion no 18 “the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock” and fasb interpretation no 35 “criteria for applying the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock” resulted in a loss from unconsolidated subsidiary representing our 28 ownership interest in hanna strategies’ results of operations through january 2 2008 when we acquired the remaining 72 

in addition during fiscal 2007 we also received 22 million recovery of funds from an escrow account established for a prior acquisition 

provision for income taxes 

autodesk accounts for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 109 “accounting for income taxes” “sfas 109” deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse 

on february 1 2007 we adopted fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions under fin 48 companies are required to recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position fin 48 clarified how a company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized provides guidance as to the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits the provisions of fin 48 were effective as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings based on our assessment we recorded an increase to opening retained earnings during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 for tax benefits not previously recognized of 264 million as a result of adopting fin 48 

  

our effective tax rate increased by 3 from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 the increase was primarily the result of a reduction in tax benefits as a percentage of pretax earnings from the lapse of statute of limitations or audit closures and the phaseout of extraterritorial income exclusion 

our effective tax rate increased by 6 from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 the increase was primarily the result of nondeductible sfas 123r expense and a reduction in tax benefits as a percentage of pretax earnings from the repatriation of certain foreign dividends at a rate lower than the 35 federal statutory rate under the american jobs creation act of 2004 “drd legislation” the drd legislation was not available after fiscal 2006 

our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate research credits sfas 123r fin 48 us manufacturer’s deduction closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits and changes in tax law 

at january 31 2008 we had net deferred tax assets of 1494 million realization of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate approximately 408 million of future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions we believe that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize these assets 

for additional information regarding our income tax provision see note 3 “income taxes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of cash is from the sale of our products our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employeerelated expenses such as compensation and benefits as well as general operating expenses for marketing facilities and overhead costs in addition to operating expenses we also use cash to fund our stock repurchase program and to invest in our growth initiatives which include business acquisitions see further discussion of these items below 

at january 31 2008 our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and shortterm marketable securities totaling 9493 million and net accounts receivable of 3865 million in addition we also have available a us line of credit facility this line of credit permits unsecured shortterm borrowings of up to 2500 million and is available for working capital or other business needs the credit agreement contains customary covenants which could restrict liens certain types of additional debt and dispositions of assets if autodesk fails to maintain its financial covenants autodesk pays a quarterly commitment fee ranging between 62500 and 156250 to maintain this facility this facility expires in august 2012 and there were no borrowings outstanding at january 31 2008 

at january 31 2008 our investment portfolio included auction rate securities with an estimated fair value of 84 million 90 million cost basis autodesk’s auction rate securities are variable rate debt instruments that have underlying securities with contractual maturities greater than ten years and interest rates that are reset at auction every 28 days these aaarated auction rate securities which met autodesk’s investment guidelines at the time the investments were made have failed to settle in auctions since august 2007 the failed auctions resulted in the interest rate on these investments resetting at libor plus 125 basis points which represents a premium interest rate on these investments at this time these investments are not currently liquid and in the event autodesk needs to access these funds the company will not be able to do so without a loss of principal unless a future auction on these investments is successful autodesk has reduced the carrying value of these investments by 06 million through other comprehensive income or loss to reflect a temporary impairment on these securities currently autodesk believes these investments are temporarily impaired but it is not clear in what period of time they will be settled based on our ability to access our cash and other shortterm investments our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash the company has the intention and ability to 

  

hold the securities until the value recovers or to maturity due to the lack of liquidity of these investments they are included in “marketable securities—noncurrent” autodesk will continue to evaluate its accounting for these investments on a quarterly basis see note 12 “financial instruments” for further discussion of autodesk’s financial instruments 

net cash flows provided by operating activities increased 1319 million to 7085 million during fiscal 2008 as compared to the prior fiscal year the increase was primarily due to an increase in net income of 665 million from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 and improved working capital management net working capital changes were driven primarily by increases in accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities that increased cash flows from operations by 384 million and 269 million respectively 

longterm cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following development of new software products and incremental product offerings resulting from the enhancement of existing products financing anticipated growth the share repurchase program the acquisition of businesses software products or technologies complementary to our business and capital expenditures including the purchase and implementation of internaluse software applications in addition 267 million of our marketable securities are held in a rabbi trust under nonqualified deferred compensation plans as of january 31 2008 see note 4 “deferred compensation” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations to minimize the effect of these fluctuations we use foreign currency option contracts to hedge our exposure on anticipated transactions and forward contracts to hedge our exposure on firm commitments primarily certain receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies our foreign currency instruments by policy have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period the principal currencies hedged during fiscal 2008 were the euro british pound japanese yen swiss franc and canadian dollar we monitor our foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at january 31 2008 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at january 31 2008 

 

  

  for the purposes of this table contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on autodesk and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction 

  

purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies services and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies services or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however in most instances the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty in addition we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products royalty expense is generally based on the number of units shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue royalty expense included in cost of license and other revenue was 149 million in fiscal 2008 168 million in fiscal 2007 121 million in fiscal 2006 

principal commitments at january 31 2008 shown above consist of obligations under operating leases for facilities and computer equipment it infrastructure costs marketing costs and contractual development costs purchase commitments also include 245 million related to a termination fee for an outsource application hosting services agreement entered into during fiscal 2006 this fee is reduced as time elapses during the fiveyear contract period 

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees including limited product warranties historically costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant but because potential future costs are highly variable we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than operating leases we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing arrangements or have any variableinterest entities as of january 31 2008 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

stock compensation 

as of january 31 2008 we maintained two active stock option plans for the purpose of granting stock options to employees and nonemployee members of autodesk’s board of directors “board” the 2006 employee stock plan “2006 plan” which is available only to employees and the 2000 directors’ option plan as amended “2000 plan” which is available only to nonemployee directors additionally there are seven expired or terminated plans with options outstanding including the 1996 stock plan which was replaced by the 2006 employee stock plan in march 2006 

the 2006 plan which was approved by autodesk’s stockholders on november 10 2005 reserved 965 million shares of autodesk common stock plus 022 million shares that remained available for issuance under the 1996 stock plan upon its expiration for issuance under the plan at january 31 2008 25 million shares were available for future issuance under this plan the 2006 plan expires in march 2008 the 2000 plan which was originally approved by the stockholders in june 2000 allows for an automatic annual grant of options to nonemployee members of autodesk’s board of directors at january 31 2008 031 million shares were available for future issuance the 2000 plan will expire in march 2010 

  

on november 6 2007 autodesk’s stockholders approved a new stock plan the 2008 employee stock plan the “2008 plan” to become effective in march 2008 upon the expiration of the 2006 plan the 2008 plan reserves 165 million shares of autodesk common stock plus 048 million shares that remained available for issuance under the 2006 stock plan upon its expiration for issuance under that plan the 2008 plan will permit the grant of stock options restricted stock and restricted stock units however no more than 25 million of the shares reserved for issuance under the 2008 plan may be issued for awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units the 2008 plan will expire in march 2011 

our stock option program is broadbased and designed to promote longterm retention essentially all of our employees participate approximately 94 of the options we granted during fiscal 2008 were awarded to employees other than our ceo cfo and the three other most highly compensated officers for fiscal 2008 which we refer to as our named executive officers options granted under our equity plans during fiscal 2008 vest over periods ranging from one to four years and expire within six to ten years of the date of grant since march 2005 the exercise price of all stock options granted is equal to the fair market value of the stock on the grant date 

all stock option grants to executive officers are made by the compensation and human resources committee of the board of directors all members of the compensation and human resources committee are independent directors as defined by the listing standards of the nasdaq global select market grants to our nonemployee directors are nondiscretionary and are predetermined by the terms of the 2000 plan 

for further information concerning autodesk’s policies and procedures regarding the use of stock options see “compensation discussion and analysis” incorporated herein by reference to the section entitled “executive compensation” in our proxy statement for our fiscal year 2008 annual meeting of stockholders to be filed with the securities and exchange commission not later than 120 days after the fiscal year ended january 31 2008 

in addition to our stock option plans our employees are also eligible to participate in autodesk’s 1998 employee qualified stock purchase plan “esp plan” eligible employees may purchase shares of autodesk’s common stock at their discretion using up to 15 of their compensation subject to certain limitations at not less than 85 of fair market value as defined in the plan agreement at january 31 2008 221 million shares were available for future issuance this amount will automatically be increased on the first trading day of each fiscal year by an amount equal to the lesser of 100 million shares or 20 of the total outstanding shares plus any shares repurchased by autodesk during the prior fiscal year we typically issue shares on march 31 and september 30 of each fiscal year the provisions of this plan expire during fiscal 2018 

on august 17 2006 autodesk disclosed that the audit committee of the board of directors was conducting a voluntary review of autodesk’s historical stock option granting practices and related accounting issues due to this review autodesk was not current with its reporting obligations under the securities exchange act of 1934 until june 2007 and suspended contributions and purchases under the esp plan during the third quarter of fiscal 2007 and the first quarter of fiscal 2008 on september 18 2006 autodesk’s board of directors approved an amendment to the company’s esp plan which provided for active participant employees at the time of the suspension to become automatically enrolled in the next offering period unless they elected not to participate the board of directors also approved a onetime cash bonus of 88 million to nonexecutive employees enrolled in the esp plan at that date this bonus approximated the profits employee participants would have made on the scheduled september 30 2006 exercise date had the purchases been made and the shares been sold on the next trading day at close of market and was expensed as additional compensation expense at the time it was paid on march 22 2007 autodesk’s board of directors approved an amendment which superseded the september 18 2006 amendment which provided for active participant employees at the time of the suspension to become automatically enrolled in the next offering period ending in september 2007 unless they elected not to participate in june 2007 the company became current with its financial filings and resumed employee contributions to the esp plan

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend foreign currency exchange risk 

our revenue earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage our foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations but such contracts do not extend beyond the current quarter contracts are primarily denominated in euros british pounds japanese yen swiss francs and canadian dollars we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

autodesk utilizes foreign currency option collar contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions a sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january 31 2008 indicated that a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 31 2008 would increase the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by 39 million a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the dollar from its value at january 31 2008 would decrease the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by 28 million the results of the sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january 31 2007 indicated that a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 31 2007 would have increased the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by 04 million and a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the dollar from its value at january 31 2007 would have increased the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by 09 million we do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows as a result of these foreign currency forward and option contracts 

interest rate sensitivity 

at january 31 2008 we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities and short term mutual fund balances of 314 million these securities were not subject to interest rate fluctuations at january 31 2007 we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities and short term mutual fund balances of 1120 million these securities were also not subject to interest rate fluctuations the shortterm mutual fund balances included 267 million at january 31 2008 and 272 million at january 31 2007 of amounts held in a rabbi trust under deferred compensation arrangements see note 4 “deferred compensation” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy guidelines which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue issuer or type of instrument

autodesk subscription program and autodesk upgrade program 

in addition to sales of new software licenses we offer our customers two ways to migrate to the most recent version of our products the autodesk subscription program and the autodesk upgrade program these programs are available for a majority of our design solution products as well as media and entertainment’s 3ds max and autodesk maya under the autodesk subscription program customers who own the most recent version of the underlying product participate in a simplified upgrade process featureenhancing extensions downloadable elearning courses and optional online support users benefit from incremental and new releases of the underlying product and extensions over one year and multiyear contract periods subscription program revenues are reported separately on our consolidated statements of income as maintenance revenue 

  

under the current autodesk upgrade program a customer who is on a currently supported version of a product which is generally the prior three versions can upgrade to the latest release of the product typically the cost to upgrade is based on a multiple of the number of versions the customer is upgrading 

product development and introduction 

we continue to enhance our product offerings and develop new products to meet changing customer demands research and development expenditures were 3016 million or 20 of fiscal 2006 net revenues 2394 million or 19 of fiscal 2005 net revenues and 2094 million or 22 of fiscal 2004 net revenues our software is primarily developed internally however we do contract services from software development firms consultants and independent contractors to supplement our development efforts additionally we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing some or all of the assets or stock of the entity that held ownership rights to the technology during fiscal 2006 approximately 9 of our total research and development expenditures were attributable to development work contracted from hanna strategies llc “hanna strategies” a software development firm with operations located in the us and china hanna strategies performs services on behalf of our design solutions segment 

the majority of our basic research and product development is performed in the us and canada and to a growing extent in china while translation and localization of foreignmarket versions as well as some product development is performed by development teams or contractors in our local markets we generally translate and localize our products into french italian german spanish japanese and various chinese dialects portions of product development including some software development localization quality assurance and technical publications are performed in europe and asia including china india singapore and the united kingdom we plan to increase our product development operations in the asiapacific region over the next several years particularly in china 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware operating systems and software as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences to keep pace with these changes we maintain an aggressive program of new product development to address demands in the marketplace for our products we dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to further enhance our existing products and to create new products and technologies however these investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs or our competitors may introduce new products and services that achieve acceptance among our current customers either of which would likely adversely affect our competitive position 

our software products are complex and despite extensive testing and quality control may contain errors or defects these defects or errors could result in corrective releases to our software products damage to our reputation loss of revenues an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products any of which would likely harm our business 

we actively recruit and hire experienced software developers and license and acquire complementary software technologies and businesses in addition we actively collaborate with and support thirdparty software developers who offer products that enhance and complement our products 

independent firms and contractors perform some of our product development activities because talented development personnel are in high demand these independent firms and contractors may not be able to provide development support to us in the future in addition we license some technology from third parties use of this licensed technology may be restricted in ways that negatively affect our business we may not be able to obtain and renew existing license agreements on favorable terms if at all and any failure to do so would likely harm our business 

in addition our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with a network of thirdparty developers who develop their own products that expand the functionality of our software some thirdparty developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn these disruptions could negatively impact these thirdparty developers and in turn end users which could harm our business 

marketing and sales 

we sell our products and services both through authorized distributors and resellers and directly to customers primarily large corporations our customerrelated operations are divided into three geographic regions the americas europemiddle eastafrica and asiapacific and are supported by global marketing and sales organizations these organizations develop and manage overall marketing and sales programs and work closely with a network of domestic and foreign offices 

  

we also work directly with reseller and distributor sales organizations computer manufacturers other software developers and peripheral manufacturers in cooperative advertising promotions and tradeshow presentations we employ massmarketing techniques such as web casts seminars telemarketing direct mailings and advertising in business and trade journals we have a worldwide user group organization dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products 

our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller networks computer software dealers and distributors are typically not highly capitalized and have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and may do so in the future while we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of dealers and distributors prior to selling to them if their financial condition were to deteriorate they might not be able to make repeat purchases the loss of or a significant reduction in business with any one of our major international distributors or large us resellers could harm our business 

we intend to continue to make our products available in foreign languages we believe that international sales will continue to comprise a significant portion of our net revenues economic weakness in any of the countries where we generate a significant portion of our net revenues would likely have a material adverse effect on our business a summary of our financial information by geographic location is found in note 13 “segments” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

customer and reseller support 

we provide technical support and training to customers through a leveraged model augmented by programs designed to address certain specific needs directly end users rely primarily on their resellers and distributors for technical support however we do provide certain direct support for our highend media and entertainment segment hardware systems we support the resellers and distributors through technical product training sales training classes the internet and direct telephone support we also provide optional online support directly to end users through our subscription program and support content is also available on the product support portion of our internet site there are also a number of user group forums in which customers are able to share information 

developer programs 

one of our key strategies is to maintain an openarchitecture design of our software products to facilitate thirdparty development of complementary products and industryspecific software solutions this approach enables customers and third parties to customize our products for a wide variety of highly specific uses we offer several programs that provide marketing sales technical support and programming tools to developers who develop addon applications for our products 

backlog 

we typically ship products shortly after receipt of an order which is common in the software industry our backlog is primarily comprised of deferred revenue deferred revenue is derived from our subscription program autodesk buzzsaw services consulting services and deferred license sales backlog also includes current software license product orders which have not yet shipped the category of current software license product orders which we have not yet shipped consists of orders from customers with approved credit status for currently available license software products and may include both orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period aggregate backlog was 3026 million at january 31 2006 of which 2856 million was deferred revenue and 170 million related to current software license product orders which had not yet shipped at the end of the fiscal year aggregate backlog was 2262 million at january 31 2005 of which 1942 million was deferred revenue and 320 million current software license product orders which had not yet shipped at the end of the fiscal year deferred revenue increased over the prior year due primarily to the success of our subscription program and we expect it to continue to increase in the future the decrease in current software license product orders which had not yet shipped at the end of the 2006 fiscal year as compared to the 2005 fiscal year is attributable to among other things the change in timing of annual product retirements from the last quarter of the fiscal year to the first quarter of the fiscal year we do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results 

competition 

the markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to rapid change in addition in each of our markets there are numerous regional and specialized software and services companies with which we compete 

  

design solutions segment 

our design solutions segment primarily competes with vendors that specialize primarily in one of the three industry segments in which we compete our competitors range from large global publicly traded software companies to small geographically focused firms our primary global competitors in this segment include dassault systemes and its subsidiary solidworks corporation parametric technology corporation ugs corporation bentley systems inc environmental systems research institute inc esri and intergraph corporation in addition in each of our markets there are numerous regional and specialized software and services companies with which we compete 

to address the lifecycle management market opportunity we are developing and introducing products that allow downstream users of data both within and external to our customer enterprises to manage and share their designs these products allow us to expand our customer base from the design and engineering departments to adjacent departments and into the supply chain this expansion may ultimately put us in competition with enterprise resource planning “erp” vendors such as oracle corporation and sap ag which have a loyal customer base within these adjacent departments recent consolidation within the erp market dominance by a few large corporations as well as their expansion in new technologies will increase competition in this market 

media  entertainment segment 

our media and entertainment segment competes in highly competitive international markets that are often subject to rapid technological change we compete with a wide range of different companies from large publiclytraded corporations to small private entities large organizations that produce products that compete in some or all of our markets include avid technology adobe systems apple computer inc sony and thomson the media and entertainment market is highly fragmented with complex interdependencies between many of the larger corporations as a result some of our competitors also own subsidiaries that are our clients or are our partners in developing or bringing to market some of our solutions 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of desktop computers with continually expanding performance capacity at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the design software market is characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies in addition the availability of thirdparty application software is a competitive factor within all of our markets 

because of these and other factors competitive conditions in these industries are likely to continue to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenues and profit margins and loss of market share any of which could harm our business furthermore in certain markets some of our competitors have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources 

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer new products and to continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to ease of use reliability performance range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation price and training 

intellectual property and licenses 

we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions nonetheless our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws enforcement of intellectual property rights against alleged infringers can sometimes lead to costly litigation and counterclaims our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business 

from time to time we receive claims alleging infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights including patents disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to among other things costly litigation or product shipment delays which could harm our business 

we retain ownership of software we develop all software is licensed to users and provided in object code pursuant to either shrinkwrap embedded or online licenses or signed license agreements these agreements contain restrictions on duplication disclosure and transfer 

we believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our intellectual property and the rapid ongoing technological changes in both the computer hardware and software industries we must rely principally upon software engineering and marketing skills to maintain and enhance our competitive market position 

  

while we have recovered some revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the full extent to which piracy of our software products exists we believe however that software piracy is and can be expected to be a persistent problem 

production and suppliers 

production of our design solutions segment and certain media and entertainment segment software products involves duplication of the software media and the printing of user manuals the purchase of media and the transfer of the software programs onto media for distribution to customers are performed by us and by licensed subcontractors media for our products include cdroms which are available from multiple sources user manuals for our products and packaging materials are produced to our specifications by outside sources production is generally performed in leased facilities operated by us some product assembly is also performed by independent thirdparty contractors to date we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the production of our software and documentation 

in addition the media and entertainment segment has historically relied on thirdparty vendors for the supply of hardware components used in its systems many of media and entertainment’s software products currently run on workstations manufactured by silicon graphics inc “sgi” there are significant risks associated with this reliance on sgi including sgi’s current financial instability and its plans for future product development which could include curtailing development of next generation workstations targeted at our markets sgi has recently announced its intentions to cease development of new products for the media and entertainment industry we now offer a complete range of media and entertainment segment products for use on standard open pcbased linux platforms to mitigate these risks our customers may now choose to adopt our products using these alternative platforms or may delay purchases while evaluating the new platforms see item 1a “risk factors” for further discussion of this risk 

employees 

as of january 31 2006 we employed 4813 people including 517 resulting from our acquisition of alias none of our employees in the united states are represented by a labor union however in certain foreign countries our employees are represented by work councils we have never experienced any work stoppages and believe our employee relations are good reliance upon employees in other countries entails various risks that possible further government instability or regulation unfavorable to foreignowned businesses could negatively impact our business in the future 

competition in recruiting personnel in the software industry especially highly skilled engineers is intense we believe our continued growth and future success is highly dependent on our continued ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees 

  

business combinations 

over the past three years we acquired new technology or supplemented our technology by purchasing businesses focused in specific markets or industries during this time period we acquired the following businesses 

 

   

 for additional information on each of the acquired businesses described above see note 10 “business combinations” in the notes to consolidated financial statements

 item 1a risk factors 

we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks many of which are beyond our control the following discussion highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on future results of operations if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted causing the trading price of our common stock to decline 

because we derive a substantial portion of our net revenues from autocadbased software products if these products are not successful our net revenues will be adversely affected 

we derive a substantial portion of our net revenues from sales of autocad software including products based on autocad that serve specific vertical markets upgrades to those products and products that are interoperable with autocad as such any factor adversely affecting sales of these products including the product release cycle market acceptance product competition performance and reliability reputation price competition economic and market conditions and the availability of thirdparty applications would likely harm our operating results 

in the media and entertainment segment our customers’ buying patterns are heavily influenced by advertising and entertainment industry cycles which have resulted in and could have a negative impact on our operating results in addition a significant percentage of the media and entertainment segment’s advanced systems products rely primarily on workstations manufactured by silicon graphics inc “sgi” on september 15 2005 sgi received an opinion from their independent registered public accounting firm that the financial condition of sgi raised substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern in addition sgi is currently reviewing its strategic options and changing the management team and refocusing its business sgi has recently announced its intention to cease development of new products for the media and entertainment industry although we have reduced our dependence on sgi workstations for the advanced systems products and will continue to do so in the future the near term failure of sgi to deliver products or product upgrades in a timely manner would likely result in an adverse effect upon our financial results for a given period 

changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business further such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective in particular the fasb issued sfas 123r which will require us to record stockbased compensation charges to earnings for employee stock option grants commencing in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 using a fairvaluebased method for determining such charges we believe that the adoption of sfas 123r will materially adversely impact our earnings and may impact the manner in which we conduct our business 

  

our international operations expose us to significant regulatory intellectual property collections exchange fluctuations taxation and other risks which could adversely impact our future net revenues and increase our net expenses 

we anticipate that international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues and will provide significant support to our overall development efforts risks inherent in our international operations include the following the impact of fluctuating exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business unexpected changes in regulatory practices and tariffs difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales and development operations longer collection cycles for accounts receivable potential changes in tax laws tax arrangements with foreign governments and laws regarding the management of data possible future limitations upon foreign owned business and greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property 

our international results will also continue to be impacted by economic and political conditions in foreign markets generally and in specific large foreign markets especially by changes in foreign exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies these factors may adversely impact our future international operations and consequently our business as a whole 

our risk management strategy uses derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward and option contracts for the purpose of hedging foreign currency market exposures during each quarter which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations these instruments provide us some protection against currency exposures for only the current quarter significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currency markets may adversely impact our future net revenues 

while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “section 404” we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting the report contains among other matters an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management such report must also contain a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of such internal controls 

while we have determined in our management report on internal control over financial reporting included in this annual report on form 10k that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 31 2006 we must continue to monitor and assess our internal control over financial reporting if our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and such weakness remains uncorrected at fiscal year end we will be unable to assert such internal control is effective at fiscal year end if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective at fiscal year end or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to attest that our management’s report is fairly stated or they are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which would likely have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 

our business could suffer as a result of risks associated with strategic acquisitions and investments such as the acquisition of alias 

we periodically acquire or invest in businesses software products and technologies that are complementary to our business through strategic alliances equity investments or acquisitions for example during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we completed the acquisition of alias systems holdings inc the risks associated with such acquisitions include among others the difficulty of assimilating the products operations and personnel of the companies the failure to realize anticipated revenue and cost projections the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business in accordance with the requirements of section 404 and the diversion of management’s time and attention in addition such investments and acquisitions may involve significant transaction or integrationrelated costs we may not be successful in overcoming such risks and such investments and acquisitions may negatively impact our business in addition such investments and acquisitions have in the past and may in the future contribute to potential fluctuations in quarterly results of operations the fluctuations could arise from transactionrelated costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant 

  

expenses or writeoffs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions these costs or charges including those relating to the alias acquisition could negatively impact results of operations for a given period or cause quarter to quarter variability in our operating results 

our operating results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenues and operating results difficult to predict 

our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include the timing of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors slowing of momentum in upgrade or maintenance revenue the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement sfas 123r that will require us to record compensation expense for shares issued under our stock plans beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 with a negative impact on our results of operations continued fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates failure to achieve anticipated levels of customer acceptance of key new applications unexpected costs or changes in marketing or other operating expenses changes in product pricing or product mix platform changes delays in product releases timing of product releases and retirements failure to continue momentum of annual release cycles or to move a significant number of customers from prior product versions in connection with our retirement programs failure to achieve continued cost reductions and productivity increases failure to convert our 2d customer base to 3d products unanticipated changes in tax rates and tax laws unexpected outcomes of matters relating to litigation distribution channel management changes in sales compensation practices the timing of large systems sales failure to effectively implement our copyright legalization programs especially in developing countries failure to successfully integrate alias and other acquired businesses and technologies failure to achieve sufficient sellthrough in our channels for new or existing products the financial and business condition of our reseller and distribution channels renegotiation or termination of royalty or intellectual property arrangements interruptions or terminations in the business of our consultants or third party developers failure to grow lifecycle management or collaboration products unanticipated impact of accounting for technology acquisitions and general economic conditions particularly in countries where we derive a significant portion of our net revenues 

we have also experienced fluctuations in operating results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic conditions in particular our operating results in europe during the third quarter are usually affected by a slow summer period and the asiapacific operations typically experience seasonal slowing in the third and fourth quarters 

our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term accordingly any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability failure to maintain rigorous cost controls would negatively affect future profitability further gross margins may be adversely affected if our sales of autocad lt upgrades and advanced systems products which historically have had lower margins grow at a faster rate than sales of our highermargin products 

existing and increased competition may reduce our net revenues and profits 

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of desktop computers with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the markets in which we compete are characterized by vigorous competition both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies in addition some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources furthermore a reduction in the number and availability of compatible thirdparty applications may adversely affect the sale of our products because of these and other factors competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future increased competition could result in continued price reductions reduced net revenues and profit margins and loss of market share any of which would likely harm our business 

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer products that compete favorably with respect to reliability performance ease of use range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation and price 

net revenues or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline 

during fiscal 2006 the market price for our common stock experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including the following net revenues or earnings shortfalls unexpected deviations in results of key performance metrics and changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts the announcement of new products or product enhancements by our competitors quarterly variations in our or our competitors’ results of operations developments in our industry unusual events such as significant acquisitions divestitures and litigation and general market conditions and other factors including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 

  

historically after periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities a company becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management’s attention and resources 

our efforts to develop and introduce new products and service offerings expose us to risks such as limited customer acceptance costs related to product defects and large expenditures that may not result in additional net revenues 

rapid technological change as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences characterize the software industry we are devoting significant resources to the development of technologies like our lifecycle management initiatives and service offerings to address demands in the marketplace for increased connectivity and use of digital data created by computeraided design software as a result we are introducing to new business models requiring a considerable investment of technical and financial resources such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs or competitors may introduce new products and services that achieve acceptance among our current customers adversely affecting our competitive position in particular a critical component of our growth strategy is to convert our 2d customer base including customers of autocad autocad lt and related vertical industry products to our 3d products such as autodesk inventor series or autodesk revit should sales of autocad autocad upgrades and autocad lt products decrease without a corresponding conversion of customer seats to 3d products our results of operations will be adversely affected 

product development may also be outsourced to thirdparties or developed externally and transferred to us through business or technology acquisitions such externally developed technologies have certain additional risks including potential difficulties with effective integration into existing products adequate transfer of technology knowhow and ownership and protection of transferred intellectual property 

additionally the software products we offer are complex and despite extensive testing and quality control may contain errors or defects these defects or errors could result in the need for corrective releases to our software products damage to our reputation loss of revenues an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products any of which would likely harm our business 

we rely on third party technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies our product and service development may be delayed 

we rely on certain software that we license from third parties including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions these thirdparty software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and the software may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software could be developed identified licensed and integrated which would likely harm our business 

in addition in the media and entertainment segment we have historically relied on thirdparty vendors for the supply of hardware components used in our systems many of the systems sold to our media and entertainment customers include software products that currently run on workstations manufactured by sgi there are significant risks associated with this dependence on sgi given sgi’s financial stability and potential changes to its future product development plans which sgi has announced will include curtailing development of next generation workstations targeted at our markets sgi has also recently announced its intentions to cease development of new products for the media and entertainment industry to mitigate against this risk among other things we offer a range of media and entertainment segment products for use on standard open pcbased linux platforms our customers may now choose to adopt our products using these alternative platforms or may delay purchases while evaluating the new platforms which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period 

disruptions with licensing relationships and third party developers could adversely impact our business 

we license certain key technologies from third parties licenses may be restricted in the term or the use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business similarly we may not be able to obtain or renew license agreements for key technology on favorable terms if at all and any failure to do so could harm our business 

our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with thirdparty developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software some developers may elect to support other products or may 

  

experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn in particular markets this disruption would likely negatively impact these thirdparty developers and end users which could harm our business 

as a result of our strategy of partnering with other companies for product development our product delivery schedules could be adversely affected if we experience difficulties with our product development partners 

we partner with certain independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities we believe our partnering strategy allows us to among other things achieve efficiencies in developing new products and maintaining and enhancing existing product offerings 

however our partnering strategy creates a dependency on such independent developers independent developers including those who currently develop products for us in the united states and throughout the world may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future in addition use of development resources through consulting relationships particularly in nonus jurisdictions with developing legal systems may be adversely impacted by and expose us to risks relating to evolving employment export and intellectual property laws these risks could among other things expose our intellectual property to misappropriation and result in disruptions to product delivery schedules 

general economic conditions may affect our net revenues and harm our business 

as our business has grown we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic and political conditions if economic growth in the united states and other countries’ economies is slowed many customers may delay or reduce technology purchases this could result in reductions in sales of our products longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition in addition weakness in the enduser market could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could in turn delay paying their obligations to us which would increase our credit risk exposure and cause delays in our recognition of revenues on future sales to these customers any of these events would likely harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we do not maintain our relationships with the members of our distribution channel or achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough our ability to generate net revenues will be adversely affected 

we sell our software products both directly to customers and through a network of distributors and resellers our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our reseller network computer software dealers and distributors are typically not highly capitalized and have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and may do so in the future while we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of dealers and distributors prior to our sales to them if their financial condition were to deteriorate they might not be able to make repeat purchases we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including tech data corporation and their affiliates who accounted for 11 of fiscal 2006 net revenues the loss of or a significant reduction in business with those distributors or resellers or the failure to achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough with any one of our major international distributors or large resellers could harm our business in particular if one or more of such resellers were unable to meet their obligations with respect to accounts payable to us we could be forced to writeoff such accounts and may be required to delay the recognition of revenues on future sales to these customers which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period 

product returns could exceed our estimates and harm our net revenues 

with the exception of contracts with some distributors our sales contracts do not contain specific productreturn privileges however we permit our distributors and resellers to return products in certain instances for example we generally allow our distributors and resellers to return older versions of products which have been superceded by new product releases we anticipate that product returns will continue to be affected by product update cycles new product releases and software quality 

we establish reserves for stock balancing and product rotation these reserves are based on historical experience estimated channel inventory levels and the timing of new product introductions and other factors while we maintain strict measures to monitor these reserves actual product returns may exceed our reserve estimates and such differences could harm our business 

if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights our business could be harmed 

we rely on a combination of patents copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software products or have obtained and used information that we regard 

  

as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our software products is timeconsuming and costly while we have recovered some revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists and software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem furthermore our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop similar technology 

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 

as more and more software patents are granted worldwide as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows and as the functionality of products in different industry segments overlap we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims infringement or misappropriation claims have in the past been and may in the future be asserted against us and any such assertions could harm our business additionally certain patent holders have become more aggressive in threatening litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents any such claims or threats whether with or without merit have in the past and could in the future be timeconsuming to defend result in costly litigation and diversion of resources or could cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in addition such royalty or license agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms if at all which would likely harm our business

we have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the sec that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our 2005 fiscal year that remained unresolved 




 item 2 properties 

we lease approximately 1447000 square feet of office space in 110 locations in the united states and internationally through our foreign subsidiaries our executive offices and the principal offices for domestic marketing sales and development are located in leased office space in san rafael california our san rafael facilities consist of approximately 290000 square feet under leases that have expiration dates ranging from 2006 to 2011 we and our foreign subsidiaries lease additional space in various locations throughout the world for local sales product development and technical support personnel 

all facilities are in good condition and are operating at capacities averaging 86 occupancy worldwide we believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet our requirements for the foreseeable future see note 7 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information about our lease commitments 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

on december 27 2001 spatial corp “spatial” filed suit in marin county superior court against autodesk and one of our consultants dcubed ltd seeking among other things termination of a development and license agreement between spatial and autodesk and an injunction preventing autodesk from working with contractors under the agreement on october 2 2003 a jury found that autodesk did not breach the agreement as the prevailing party in the action the court awarded autodesk approximately 24 million for reimbursement of attorneys’ fees and the costs of trial which was paid during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 spatial filed a notice of appeal on december 2 2003 appealing the decision of the jury spatial claims that certain testimony of a witness should not have been considered by the jury and as a result spatial asserts that it is entitled to a new trial on march 23 2006 the court of appeal denied spatial’s appeal as a result we believe the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material effect on autodesk’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

on august 26 2005 telstra corporation limited “telstra” filed suit in the federal court of australia victoria district registry against autodesk australia pty ltd “aapl” seeking partial indemnification for claims filed against telstra by spatialinfo pty limited relating to telstra’s use of certain software in the management of its computer based cable plant records system on december 12 2005 spatialinfo added aapl as a defendant to its lawsuit against telstra autodesk is currently investigating the allegations and intends to vigorously defend the case although this case is in the early stages and autodesk cannot determine the final financial impact of this matter based on the facts known at this time we believe the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material effect on autodesk’s financial position results of operations or cash flows however it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of this matter could occur and materially affect our future results of operations cash flows or financial position in a particular period 

  

in connection with our antipiracy program designed to enforce copyright protection of our software and conducted both internally and through the business software alliance “bsa” from time to time we undertake litigation against alleged copyright infringers or provide information to criminal justice authorities to conduct actions against alleged copyright infringers such lawsuits have lead to counter claims alleging improper use of litigation or violation of other local law and have recently increased in frequency especially in latin america on march 1 2002 consultores en computación y contabilidad sc a mexican hardwaresoftware reseller and its principals collectively “ccc” filed a lawsuit in the mexico court in the first civil court of the federal district against autodesk adobe systems microsoft and symantec all members of the bsa and collectively the “defendants” ccc had been the target of a criminal antipiracy enforcement action carried out by the mexican police authorities on august 11 1998 on the basis of a complaint filed by the defendants in 1997 based on evidence provided to the defendants that ccc had engaged in software piracy of the defendants’ products ccc alleged in the lawsuit that it had suffered 100 million in damages to its reputation as a result of the enforcement action known as “moral damages” ccc did not claim economic damages on november 11 2002 the trial court judge ruled in favor of the defendants holding that no moral damage occurred since ccc was unable to prove the illegal nature of the defendants’ actions after subsequent appeals all of which were won by the defendants a court of appeals held that the defendants were liable to ccc for “moral” damages and the court remanded the case to the first civil court for a determination of the amount on december 13 2005 the first civil court awarded ccc 90 million in damages the defendants are appealing the verdict as are the plaintiffs who are seeking additional damages if after all appeals have been exhausted the existing verdict stands and is enforceable in the united states autodesk would be responsible for approximately 10 million of the judgment based on the facts and circumstances of this case known at this time we believe the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material effect on autodesk’s financial position results of operations or cash flows however it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of this matter could occur and materially affect our future results of operations cash flows or financial position in a particular period 

in addition we are involved in legal proceedings from time to time arising from the normal course of business activities including claims of alleged infringement of intellectual property rights commercial employment piracy prosecution and other matters in our opinion resolution of pending matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or our financial position however it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more such proceedings could in the future materially affect our future results of operations cash flows or financial position in a particular period

 item 5 market for the registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 

our common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market under the symbol adsk the following table lists the high and low sales prices for each quarter in the last two fiscal years these share prices were adjusted for the twoforone stock split that was effective for holders of record on december 6 2004 

 

   

 dividends 

adjusted for the stock split in december 2004 we paid quarterly dividends of 0015 per share in fiscal 2005 and 2004 to autodesk stockholders effective after the dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 paid in april 2005 we discontinued our quarterly cash dividend 

stockholders 

as of january 31 2006 the number of common stockholders of record was 686 because many of our shares of common stock are held by brokers or other institutions on behalf of stockholders we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by the record holders 

issuer purchases of equity securities 

the purpose of autodesk’s stock repurchase program is to help offset the dilution to net income per share caused by the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans as well as to more effectively utilize excess cash generated from our business the number of shares acquired and the timing of the purchases are based on several factors including the level of our cash balances general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities at january 31 2006 205 million shares remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization see note 8 “stockholders’ equity” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

the following table provides information about the repurchase of our common stock during the three months ended january 31 2006 

 

   


 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we begin management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” with our overall strategy and the individual strategies for our major business units that reflect the goals of our business and the direction in which our business and products are moving this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results in the next section we discuss our results of operations for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 and for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 beginning with an overview we then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows and discuss our financial commitments in the sections entitled “liquidity and capital resources” “contractual obligations” and “offbalance sheet arrangements” 

the mda should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form 10k including item 1 “business” item 1a “risk factors” item 6 “selected financial data” and item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

the discussion in our mda contains trend analyses and other forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 forwardlooking statements consist of among other things statements regarding the financial impact of the alias acquisition the expected impact on autodesk’s consolidated income and net income per share of the adoption of sfas 123r in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 anticipated future operating margins net revenues product backlog upgrade and maintenance revenues the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates on net revenues and expenses costs and expenses including cost of revenues and operating expenses future income planned product retirement and annual release cycles expectations regarding product acceptance continuation of our share repurchase program and shortterm and longterm cash requirements as well as statements involving trend analyses and statements including such words as “we believe” and “plan” and similar expressions these forwardlooking statements are subject to business and economic risks as such our actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements as a result of the factors set forth above in item 1a “risk factors” and in our other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 

  

strategy 

our goal is to be the world’s leading design software and services company for the building manufacturing infrastructure media and entertainment and wireless location based services industries our focus is to help customers create manage and share their data and digital assets more effectively and improve efficiencies across the entire lifecycle management process 

we believe that our ability to make technology available to mainstream markets is one of our competitive advantages by innovating in existing technology categories we bring powerful design products to volume markets our architecture allows for extensibility and integration our products are designed to be easy to learn and use and to provide customers low cost of deployment low total cost of ownership and a rapid return on investment 

we have created a large global community of resellers thirdparty developers and customers which provides us with a broad reach into volume markets our reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with global resources for the purchase and support of our products as well as resources for effective and cost efficient training services we have a significant number of registered thirdparty developers creating products that run on top of our products further extending our reach into volume markets our installed base of millions of users has made autodesk’s products a worldwide design software standard users trained on autodesk products are broadly available both from universities and the existing work force reducing the cost of training for our customers 

our growth strategy derives from these core strengths we continue to increase the business value of our desktop design tools for our customers in a number of ways we improve the performance and functionality of existing products with each new release and we have increased the frequency of most of our releases beyond our horizontal design products we develop products addressing specific vertical market needs in addition we believe that migration from our 2d products to our higher priced 3d products presents a significant growth opportunity while the rate of migration to 3d varies from industry to industry adoption of 3d design software should increase the productivity of our customers in all industries and result in richer design data however this migration also poses various risks to us in particular if we do not successfully convert our 2d customer base to our 3d products as expected and sales of our 2d products decrease without a corresponding increase in customer seats of our 3d products we would not realize the growth we expect and our business would be adversely affected 

longer term once the mainstream market has migrated to 3d design we believe the richer design data created by our 3d products requires better tools for design information management also known as lifecycle management we believe that for each author of design information there are multiple users of that information downstream as a result we are developing and introducing products that will allow downstream users both within and external to our customer enterprises to manage and share their designs we believe our large installed base provides an opportunity to sell additional products to design and engineering departments and to expand our customer base from these design and engineering departments to adjacent departments and into the supply chain 

expanding our geographic coverage is a key element of our growth strategy we believe that rapidly growing economies including those of china india and eastern europe present significant growth opportunities for us in support of our growth efforts in china we opened our china application development center the “center” during fiscal 2004 with a level of understanding of local markets that could not be obtained from remote operations the center develops both products for the worldwide market as well as products to specifically address the chinese market in addition we believe that our products will have a competitive advantage as a result of being engineered locally we believe our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize product development and lower costs however international development whether conducted by us or independent developers on our behalf involves significant costs and challenges including whether we can adequately protect our intellectual property and derive significant revenue in areas such as emerging economies where software piracy is a substantial problem 

another significant part of our growth strategy is to improve upon our installed base a key element of this strategy is our ability to release major products on an annual basis strong annual release cycles have a number of benefits in particular they permit us to deliver key performance and functionality improvements to customers on a regular and timely basis annual releases also help us to increase product maintenance revenues and significantly reduce our reliance on product upgrade revenues thereby reducing the volatility of revenues we have experienced in the past 

we are continually focused on improving productivity and efficiency in all areas of autodesk in order to allow us to increase our investment in growth initiatives and improve our profitability during fiscal 2004 we conducted a rigorous study of our cost structure beginning in fiscal 2004 we undertook a restructuring plan that concluded at the end of fiscal 2005 implementing certain productivity and efficiency initiatives throughout autodesk and committing to continuous 

  

improvements in our productivity our operating margin was 24 during fiscal 2006 19 during fiscal 2005 and 11 during fiscal 2004 these increased operating margins were achieved at the same time we continued to invest in growth initiatives over the longer term we intend to continue to balance investments in revenue growth opportunities with our goal of increasing our operating margins 

we generate significant cash flows our uses of cash include share repurchases to offset the dilutive impact of our employee stock plans as well as investments in acquisitions and investments in growth initiatives such as our recent acquisition of alias systems holdings inc “alias” during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 see note 10 “business combinations” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion we evaluate merger and acquisition and divestiture opportunities to the extent they support our strategy our typical acquisitions are intended to provide adjacency to our current products and services specific technology or expertise and rapid product integration additionally we continue to invest in growth initiatives including product development and sales market and channel development

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles in preparing our consolidated financial statements we make assumptions judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements we base our assumptions judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions we regularly reevaluate our assumptions judgments and estimates we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 

revenue recognition our accounting policies and practices are in compliance with statement of position 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended and sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” 

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 

for multiple element arrangements that include software products we allocate the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on their vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value vsoe is the price charged when that element is sold separately or the price as set by management with the relevant authority if we do not have vsoe of the undelivered element we defer revenue recognition on the entire sales arrangement until all elements are delivered we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 

our assessment of likelihood of collection is also a critical element in determining the timing of revenue recognition if we do not believe that collection is probable the revenue will be deferred until the earlier of when collection is deemed probable or cash is received 

our product sales to distributors and resellers are generally recognized at the time title to our product passes to the distributor or reseller provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met this policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns we are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments regardless of whether they collect cash from their customers if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

  

license and other revenues include revenues from the sale of new seats upgrades customer consulting and training upgrade revenues are generated under the autodesk upgrade program our existing customers who are using a currently supported version of a product can upgrade to the latest release of the product by paying a separate fee at the time of upgrade that is based on the number of versions being upgraded an existing customer also has the option to upgrade to a higher priced discipline specific or 3d product for a premium fee we refer to this as a crossgrade revenues from the sale of new seats and upgrade fees are generally recognized at the time of sale provided all revenue recognition criteria have been met customer consulting and training revenues are recognized over time as the services are performed 

maintenance revenues consist primarily of revenues from our subscription program under this program customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades whenandifavailable downloadable training courses and optional online support we recognize revenues from our subscription program ratably over the subscription contract periods 

product returns reserves with the exception of contracts with certain distributors our sales contracts do not contain specific productreturn privileges however we permit our distributors and resellers to return product in certain instances generally when new product releases supersede older versions the product returns reserve is based on historical experience of actual product returns estimated channel inventory levels the timing of new product introductions channel sellin for applicable markets and other factors 

our product returns reserves were 142 million at january 31 2006 and 153 million at january 31 2005 product returns as a percentage of applicable revenues were 37 in fiscal 2006 41 in fiscal 2005 and 54 in fiscal 2004 during fiscal year 2006 we recorded additions to our product returns reserve of 410 million which reduced our revenue 

while we believe our accounting practice for establishing and monitoring product returns reserves is adequate and appropriate any adverse activity or unusual circumstances could result in an increase in reserve levels in the period in which such determinations are made 

realizability of longlived assets we assess the realizability of our longlived assets and related intangible assets other than goodwill annually during the fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review significant underperformance of a business or product line relative to budget shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends and the results of past impairment reviews 

in assessing the recoverability of these longlived assets we first determine their fair values which are based on assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows that could reasonably be generated by these assets when assessing longlived assets we use undiscounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of the impairment charge impairment charges if any result in situations where the fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values 

in addition to our recoverability assessments we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our longlived assets any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made as well as in subsequent quarters 

we will continue to evaluate the values of our longlived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

goodwill as required under statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” we no longer amortize goodwill but test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

deferred tax assets we currently have 1936 million of net deferred tax assets mostly arising from net operating losses including stock option deductions as well as tax credits reserves and timing differences for purchased technologies and capitalized software offset by the establishment of us deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries we perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets which is principally dependent upon our achievement of projected future taxable income of approximately 607 million in specific geographies our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors these changes if any may require possible material adjustments to these net deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determinations are made 

  

autodesk is a us based multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions our effective tax rate is based on expected geographic income statutory rates and enacted tax rules including transfer pricing significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis we believe our tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it conducts its business it is possible that these positions may be challenged which may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 

restructuring expenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 the board of directors approved a restructuring plan that resulted in the elimination of employee positions and the closure of a number of offices worldwide “fiscal 2004 plan” this plan was designed to improve efficiencies across the organization reduce operating expense levels to help achieve our targeted operating margins and redirect resources to product development sales development and other critical areas the actions approved under this plan were completed by the end of fiscal 2005 

facility lease termination costs were based upon projected rental payments through the remaining terms of the underlying operating leases offset by projected sublease income the projected sublease income amounts were calculated by using information provided by thirdparty real estate brokers as well as management judgments and were based on assumptions for each of the real estate markets where the leased facilities were located if real estate markets worsen and we are not able to sublease the properties as expected we will record additional expenses in the period when such rental payments are made this situation occurred during each of fiscal 2005 and 2004 we therefore recorded additional charges as a result of the inability to sublease abandoned facilities if the real estate markets subsequently improve and we are able to sublease the properties earlier or at more favorable rates than projected we will reverse a portion of the underlying restructuring accruals which will result in increased net income in the period when such sublease becomes effective 

stock option accounting  historically we have not recorded compensation expense when stock option grants are awarded to employees at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of autodesk common stock on the date of grant we disclose in note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements the expense consistent with the method of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 “accounting for stock issued to employees” “sfas 123” the alternative fair value accounting provided for under sfas 123 requires the use of option valuation models which require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected life of the option and expected future volatility of our stock changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate had we recorded compensation expense from stock option grants our net income would have been substantially less we are adopting statement of financial accounting standards no 123 – revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” which replaces sfas 123 and supersedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” “apb 25” in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 autodesk believes the adoption of sfas 123r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas 123 and that the adoption of sfas 123r will have a material adverse effect on autodesk’s consolidated statements of income and net income per share the estimated impact is contingent upon many factors including but not limited to the market value of autodesk’s common stock on the date future options are granted 

legal contingencies  as described in item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 7 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations 

recently issued accounting standards 

in december 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123 – revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” which replaces statement of financial accounting standards no 123 “sfas 123” and supersedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” sfas 123r requires the measurement of all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options using a fairvalue based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of income autodesk is required to adopt sfas 123r and is adopting it starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas 123 will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition see note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net income and net income per share amounts for fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 as if we had used a fairvalue based method similar to the methods required under sfas 123r to measure compensation expense for employee stock awards autodesk believes the adoption of sfas 123r will 

  

result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas 123 and that the adoption of sfas 123r will have a material adverse effect on autodesk’s consolidated statements of income and net income per share this estimated impact is contingent upon many factors including but not limited to the market value of our common stock on the date future options are granted 

in march 2005 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sab 107” “sharebased payment” which provides interpretive guidance related to the interaction between sfas 123r and certain sec rules and regulations as well as provides the sec staff’s views regarding the valuation of sharebased payment arrangements the relevant interpretive guidance of sab 107 will be applied in connection with our implementation and adoption of sfas 123r 

in june 2005 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 154 “ accounting changes and error corrections” “sfas 154” a replacement of apb opinion 20 “accounting changes” and sfas no 3  “reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements”  sfas 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle previously most voluntary changes in accounting principles were required recognition via a cumulative effect adjustment within net income of the period of change sfas 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements unless it is impracticable to determine either the periodspecific effects or the cumulative effect of the change sfas 154 is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 however sfas 154 does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements we do not believe adoption of sfas 154 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

  the primary goals for fiscal 2006 were to continue our delivery of marketleading products and solutions to our customers to drive revenue growth and market share gains while increasing our profitability we achieved these goals as demonstrated by our 23 net revenue increase during fiscal 2006 as compared to the prior fiscal year along with the increase in our operating margin to 24 in fiscal 2006 our fiscal 2006 product releases offered continued advancements in design and authoring productivity as well as project lifecycle management capability 

our net revenues were higher in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 due primarily to strong new seat and subscription revenues net revenues grew despite the negative effects of changes in foreign currencies during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 resulting from the recent strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies the foreign currency effect on net revenues was negative 210 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and negative 91 million for the entire fiscal 2006 year compared to fiscal 2005 new seat revenues increased 21 subscription revenues increased 56 and upgrade revenues increased 5 revenue growth was driven by volume growth in most major products as well as growing sales of the higher priced vertical and 3d products product sales volume has increased due to the strength of our current product releases including autocad 2006 and autocad lt autodesk inventor products autodesk civil 3d autodesk revit products and autodesk architectural desktop 

product backlog is comprised of deferred revenue and current software license product orders which have not yet shipped the category of current software license product orders which we have not yet shipped consists of orders from customers with approved credit status for currently available license software products and may include orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period aggregate backlog at january 31 2006 and january 31 2005 was 3026 million and 2262 million respectively of which 170 million and 320 million related to current software license product orders which have not yet shipped at the end of each respective fiscal year the decrease in current software license product orders which had not yet shipped at the end of the 2006 fiscal year as compared to the 2005 fiscal year is attributable to the change in timing of annual product retirements from the last quarter of the fiscal year to the first quarter of the fiscal year 

we generate a significant amount of our revenue in the united states japan germany united kingdom italy china france south korea australia and canada the stronger value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies particularly 

  

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 had a negative impact of 101 million on operating results in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 had exchange rates from fiscal 2005 been in effect during fiscal 2006 translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been 91 million higher and operating expenses would have been 10 million lower changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant effect on net revenues in future periods we use foreign currency option collar contracts to reduce the current quarter exchange rate impact on the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions 

the percentage of total costs and expenses decreased to 76 of net revenues in fiscal 2006 from 81 of net revenues in fiscal 2005 total headcount increased to 4813 at january 31 2006 including 517 from the acquisition of alias in the fourth quarter excluding the alias acquisition headcount increased by 24 from 3477 at january 31 2005 our operating margins are very sensitive to changes in revenues given the relatively fixed nature of most of our expenses which consist primarily of employeerelated expenditures facilities costs and depreciation and amortization expense during fiscal 2007 we expect total costs and expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we balance investment in our growth opportunities with our focus on increasing profitability 

the required adoption of sfas 123r in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 will result in increased employeerelated expenditures related to the expensing of employee stock option grants and our employee stock purchase plan offering as a result we expect total costs and expenses to increase as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal 2007 see note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

throughout fiscal 2006 we maintained a strong balance sheet and generated 4152 million of cash from our operating activities as compared to 3731 million in the previous year we finished the year with 3775 million in cash and marketable securities down from 5327 million at january 31 2005 this decline is primarily a result of the 1968 in cash consideration paid to acquire alias during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 see note 10 “business combinations” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion we completed fiscal 2006 with a higher deferred revenue balance and a higher accounts receivable balance as compared to the previous year seventyfive percent or 2134 million of the deferred revenues balance at january 31 2006 consisted of customer subscription contracts which will be recognized as maintenance revenue ratably over the life of the contracts which is predominantly one year accounts receivable increased 646 million as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year driven by the increase in revenue the increase in subscription billings and the inclusion of 182 million in accounts receivable acquired from alias 

results of operations 

net revenues 

 

    

fiscal 2006 net revenues compared to fiscal 2005 net revenues 

the increase in net revenues during fiscal 2006 was due primarily to strong subscription and new seat revenues continued growth in autocad and autocad lt revenues along with a favorable product mix shift towards higher priced 3d products in addition we experienced strong growth in all three of our geographic regions and we experienced especially strong growth rates in our emerging economies of china eastern europe and india 

growth in license and other revenues during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to increased new seat revenues from most major products and to a lesser extent to a modest increase in upgrade revenues new seat revenue increases were driven by volume growth in autocad autocad lt and most major products and growing sales of our higher priced 3d products upgrade revenue increased in fiscal 2006 but at a lower rate than in fiscal 2005 as customers increasingly migrate to our subscription program and as we moved the retirement date of the autocad 2002based products to the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we have now synchronized our major product retirements and new release launches to occur in the first quarter of each fiscal year we currently anticipate that autocad 2004based products will be retired in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 the installed base of the autocad 2004based products not on subscription at the beginning of fiscal 2007 is smaller than the installed base of autocad 2002based products not on subscription at the beginning of fiscal 2006 as a result and with the success of our subscription program we expect subscription revenue to exceed upgrade revenue in fiscal 2007 and we expect upgrade revenues to decline this shift away from upgrade revenues toward a more predictable and sustainable subscription revenue stream is consistent with our longterm growth strategy 

revenue from the sales of our services training and support are immaterial for all periods presented 

maintenance revenues consist of revenues derived from the subscription program as a percentage of total net revenues maintenance revenues were 18 and 14 for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 respectively our subscription program available to most customers worldwide continues to attract new and renewal customers by providing them with a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of our planned annual product release cycle and enhancements we expect maintenance revenues to continue to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues 

net revenues in the americas region increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 largely due to strong subscription and new seat revenues offset in part by lower upgrade revenues 

net revenues in the europe middle east and africa “emea” region increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to strong subscription new seat and upgrade revenues and growth in the emea emerging markets of russia poland czech republic and the middle east 

net revenues in the asiapacific “apac” region increased during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily from strong new seat revenues and to a lesser extent from subscription and upgrade revenues as our subscription program was introduced in the apac region after successful introductions first in the americas and then in emea we experienced strong growth during fiscal 2006 in japan china australia and south korea 

the increase in net revenues for the design solutions segment during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to strong new seat and subscription revenues as well as a more modest increase in upgrade revenues maintenance revenue from our subscription program increased to 20 of design solutions segment revenue in fiscal 2006 as compared to 16 in fiscal 2005 although we have been placing increased focus on verticallyoriented and 3d product lines sales of autocad autocad upgrades and autocad lt continue to comprise a significant portion of our net revenues such sales which are reflected in the net revenues for the platform technology division and other accounted for 

  

44 of our consolidated net revenues in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 growing 23 in absolute dollars between the periods net revenues for our 3d design products autodesk inventor products autodesk revit products and autodesk civil 3d increased 60 during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 total sales of 3d design products accounted for 19 of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2006 compared to 14 in fiscal 2005 a critical component of our growth strategy is to grow our 2d base while migrating our customers including customers of autocad and related vertical industry products to our higherpriced 3d products however should sales of 2d products decrease without a corresponding increase in sales of 3d products our results of operations will be adversely affected 

net revenues for the media and entertainment segment “me” during fiscal 2006 increased 8 as compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to new seat and subscription revenues of our animation product 3ds max as well as growth in the sales of our linuxbased advanced systems products these increases were partially offset by recent declines in advanced systems sales on the sgi platform net revenues from advanced systems sales were 1123 million during fiscal 2006 as compared to 1104 million during fiscal 2005 the transition of our advanced systems customers from the higherpriced proprietary sgi platform to lowerpriced open pcbased platforms may continue to adversely impact advanced systems revenue in fiscal 2007 

international sales accounted for 66 of our net revenues in fiscal 2006 as compared to 65 in the prior fiscal year we believe that international sales will continue to comprise a significant portion of net revenues economic weakness in any of the countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenues would have a material adverse effect on our business had exchange rates from fiscal 2005 been in effect during fiscal 2006 translated international revenues would have been 91 million higher for fiscal 2006 recent strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies if it were to continue could significantly and adversely impact our future financial results for a given period net revenues in emerging economies of china india and eastern europe grew by greater than 60 between fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 this growth was a significant factor in our international sales growth during fiscal 2006 

fiscal 2005 net revenues compared to fiscal 2004 net revenues 

net revenues during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 increased in all three of our geographic areas due primarily to strong subscription new seat and upgrade revenues coupled with the positive effects of changes in foreign currencies 

during the first part of fiscal 2004 customers in the industries we serve particularly manufacturing commercial construction and media and entertainment were impacted by economic pressures in their own businesses resulting in a difficult customer purchasing environment however by the end of fiscal 2004 and through fiscal 2005 we saw a lessening of these economic pressures 

the increase in license and other revenues for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was due primarily to increased new seat and upgrade revenues across all major products as a result of our new product releases and the announced retirement of the autocad 2000ibased product series for early calendar 2005 in addition changes in foreign currencies had a positive impact on revenue revenue from the sales of our services training and support are immaterial for all periods presented 

maintenance revenues consisting of revenues derived from the subscription program increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 as our subscription program continued to attract new and renewal customers as a percentage of total net revenues maintenance revenues were 14 and 12 for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 respectively 

net revenues in the americas increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 largely due to strong new seat upgrade and subscription revenue most of the first half of fiscal 2004 was impacted by the difficult selling environment experienced in the industries we serve however the later half of fiscal 2004 had strong upgrade and subscription revenues which carried into fiscal 2005 

net revenues in the emea region increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due primarily to strong new seat upgrade and subscription sales as well as favorable exchange rates ignoring the effects of changes in foreign currencies during the year net revenues for emea increased approximately 20 as compared to fiscal 2004 

the increase in asiapacific region net revenues during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was due primarily to strong new seat subscription and upgrade revenues as well as favorable exchange rates revenues for fiscal 2004 were adversely affected by the impact on our sales operations of concerns regarding severe acute respiratory syndrome “sars” primarily during the second quarter of fiscal 2004 ignoring the effects of changes in foreign currencies during fiscal 2005 net revenues for asiapacific increased approximately 31 as compared to fiscal 2004 

  

the increase in net revenues for the design solutions segment during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was due primarily to strong new seat upgrade and subscription revenues and favorable exchange rates revenue from upgrades and subscriptions combined accounted for 38 of design solutions segment revenues for fiscal 2005 and 41 of design solutions segment revenue for fiscal 2004 maintenance revenue accounted for 16 of design solutions segment revenue for fiscal 2005 and 14 of design solutions segment revenues for fiscal 2004 during fiscal 2005 and 2004 sales of autocad autocad upgrades and autocad lt continue to comprise a significant portion of our net revenues such sales which are reflected in the net revenues for the platform technology division and other accounted for 44 of our consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2005 and 45 for fiscal 2004 net revenues for our 3d products increased approximately 69 for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 

net revenues for the media and entertainment segment increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to growth in new seat and subscription revenues of our 3ds max animation software an entire product line refresh of our editing and effects systems during fiscal 2005 and favorable exchange rates net revenues from our advanced systems products were 1104 million as compared to 919 million in fiscal 2004 

international sales accounted for 65 of our net revenues in fiscal 2005 as compared to 63 in the prior fiscal year ignoring the effects of changes in foreign currencies during fiscal 2005 international sales would have remained consistent at 63 of net revenues 

cost of revenues 

 

 cost of license and other revenues includes direct material and overhead charges royalties amortization of purchased technology and capitalized software hosting costs and the labor costs of fulfilling service contracts direct material and overhead charges include the cost of hardware sold mainly workstations manufactured by sgi and ibm for the media and entertainment segment costs associated with transferring our software to electronic media printing of user manuals and packaging materials and shipping and handling costs 

cost of license and other revenues increased slightly in dollar amount during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 due to higher direct material overhead and royalty expenses for licensed technology embedded in our products all of which result from increased volumes these increases were partially offset by a reduction in amortization of purchased technology and capitalized software the increase in cost of license and other revenues during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to increased volume and changes in product mix and slightly higher royalty expenses 

cost of maintenance revenues includes direct costs of our subscription program amortization of capitalized software and overhead charges the decrease in cost of maintenance revenues during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was due primarily to the cessation of amortization for an information technology system supporting our subscription program the amortization reduction was partially offset by incremental direct program costs incurred as part of the growth of the subscription program the increase in cost of maintenance revenues during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to incremental direct program costs incurred as part of the expansion of the subscription program 

overall cost of revenues continues to decline as a percentage of net revenues due to the amount of fixed costs that are not directly impacted by the growth in our sales volumes as well as productivity measures in distribution and order management however despite this trend we expect the cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues to increase in future periods as a result of recording stockbased compensation expense beginning in fiscal 2007 as required by sfas 123r absent stockbased compensation expense we expect cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues to remain relatively consistent with fiscal 2006 cost of revenues at least over the near term are affected by the volume and mix of product sales changing consulting and hosted service costs software amortization costs royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products and new customer support offerings 

  

marketing and sales 

 

 marketing and sales expenses include salaries dealer and sales commissions bonus travel and facility costs for our marketing sales order processing dealer training and support personnel and overhead charges these expenses also include costs of programs aimed at increasing revenues such as advertising trade shows and expositions and various sales and promotional programs designed for specific sales channels and end users 

the increase of marketing and sales expenses during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was due primarily to 565 million of increased marketing and promotion costs related to product launches trade shows and branding and 143 million of higher employeerelated costs reflecting increased headcount which were partially offset by a reduction in commissions and bonus accruals and an increase in information technology costs 

marketing and sales expenses increased during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due primarily to approximately 402 million of increased commission bonus and other incentive compensation expenses related to the increased sales volume approximately 233 million of higher advertising branding and promotion costs as well as costs related to a customer information and customer support software project offset in part by restructuringrelated cost savings 

we expect to continue to invest in marketing and sales of our products to develop market opportunities to promote our competitive position and to strengthen our channel support in addition as a result of recording stockbased compensation expense beginning in fiscal 2007 as required by sfas 123r we expect marketing and sales expenses to increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues 

research and development 

 

 research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries benefits and bonuses for software engineers fees paid to software development firms and independent contractors purchased inprocess technology depreciation of computer equipment used in software development and overhead charges 

the increase in research and development expenses during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 resulted primarily from efforts to invest additional resources in certain research and developmentrelated growth initiatives employeerelated costs increased approximately 194 million reflecting increased headcount and professional fees increased approximately 183 million in fiscal 2006 as compared to the prior fiscal year during fiscal 2006 we incurred approximately 270 million for consulting services and purchased inprocess technology from hanna strategies for our design solutions segment the inprocess technology is intended for future releases of various products that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use also contributing to the yearoveryear increase was an increase in information technology costs in addition we recognized 79 million of inprocess research and development costs in connection with our acquisition of alias and 12 million related to our acquisition of colorfront ltd 

the increase in research and development expenses between fiscal years 2005 and 2004 was due primarily from efforts to invest additional resources made available through restructuringrelated savings in certain growth initiatives employeerelated costs increased approximately 140 million in fiscal 2005 as compared to prior year of which approximately 109 million related to higher bonus accruals and benefits based on financial performance in addition we incurred 14 million related to localization of new product releases and approximately 135 million for consulting services and purchased inprocess technology from hanna strategies for our design solutions segment 

  

we expect that research and development spending will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to invest in product development and continue to acquire new technology in addition we expect that research and development spending will continue to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in the future as a result of recording stockbased compensation expense beginning in fiscal 2007 as required by sfas 123r 

general and administrative 

 

 general and administrative expenses include our finance human resources legal costs and overhead charges the amortization expense of customer relationships and trademarks acquired from alias is also included in general and administrative expenses 

the increase in general and administrative expenses from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was primarily due to an increase of 126 million in information technology project costs 81 million in employeerelated costs primarily resulting from increased headcount and 29 million increase in litigation expenses 

during fiscal 2006 and 2005 we incurred significant incremental costs related to our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “sox” we estimate that we incurred approximately 23 million during fiscal 2006 64 million during fiscal 2005 which included significant project startup costs and approximately 04 million in fiscal 2004 related to our fiscal 2005 evaluation these cost estimates include external consulting and auditing fees and internal employee costs 

the increase in general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to approximately 78 million of higher bonus accruals and benefits based on financial performance 24 million of stock compensation expense incurred in connection with the change in employment status of a senior executive officer offset in part by a reduction in itrelated expenses and headcount reductions due to restructuring efforts in addition general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2004 included the effects of a 25 million reversal of a litigation accrual related to the spatial matter 

absent the impact of recording stockbased compensation expense beginning in fiscal 2007 as required by sfas 123r we expect that general and administrative expenses will modestly decline as a percentage of net revenues in the future yet increase in absolute dollars due to salary increases and continued information technology projects with the adoption of sfas 123r and the recording of stockbased compensation expense in fiscal 2007 we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues 

restructuring 

 

 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 management implemented a restructuring plan directly resulting from the alias acquisition which involved the elimination of employee positions facilities and fixed assets of alias “alias restructuring plan” total estimated cost of the alias restructuring plan is 111 million the total restructuring reserve established for this plan was reflected in the purchase price allocation the alias restructuring plan was established in accordance with emerging issues task force 953 “ recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination ” subsequent adjustments to our original estimates for this plan will not be shown as restructuring expenses but will instead be made as adjustments to the alias purchase price allocation and will impact goodwill see note 10 “business combinations” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we implemented a restructuring plan involving the elimination of employee positions and the closure of a number of offices worldwide having a total cost of 275 million “fiscal 2004 plan” this plan was designed to improve efficiencies across the organization reduce operating expense levels to help achieve our targeted operating margins and redirect resources to product development sales development and other critical areas the actions approved under the fiscal 2004 plan were completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 

during fiscal 2005 we recorded net restructuring charges of 267 million of which 237 million related to the fiscal 2004 plan of this amount 198 million related to employee termination costs for 316 employees worldwide 186 in the united states and 130 outside the united states and 39 million related to the closure of facilities also we recorded net restructuring charges of approximately 30 million related to the fiscal 2002 restructuring plan for additional office closure costs originally established under the fiscal 2002 restructuring plan since the office closures in fiscal 2002 there has been a significant downturn in the commercial real estate market particularly in areas of the united kingdom where some of the offices are located as such autodesk is unable to either buyout the remaining lease obligations at favorable amounts or sublease the space at amounts previously estimated 

during fiscal 2004 autodesk recognized net restructuring charges of 32 million of which 38 million related to the fiscal 2004 plan 11 million related to additional office closure costs under the fiscal 2002 restructuring plan and reversals of the accrual for changes in estimates of 17 million related to underlying liabilities originally established under the fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2003 restructuring plans of the 38 million related to the fiscal 2004 plan 36 million related to employee termination costs for 86 employees worldwide 71 in the united states and 15 outside the united states and 02 million related to office closure costs office closure costs included losses on operating leases and the writeoff of leasehold improvements and equipment employee termination costs consisted of onetime termination benefits including severance benefits medical benefits and outplacement costs with respect to the 17 million of reversals the underlying liabilities primarily related to employee termination costs outside the united states were ultimately settled for less than originally estimated 

for additional information regarding restructuring reserves see note 11 “restructuring reserves” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

interest and other income net 

the following table sets forth the components of interest and other income net 

 

 investment income fluctuates based on average cash and marketable securities balances average maturities and interest rates the increase in interest and investment income net during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 reflects proportionately higher interest rate yields during the current fiscal year 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 we determined that certain money market fund investments were subject to 28 million of swiss transfer stamp taxes from the third quarter of fiscal 2001 through the second quarter of fiscal 2005 we determined that the impact of this adjustment was not material to previously reported periods 

legal proceeding settlement of 24 million was received during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 as part of a court settlement related to legal proceedings with spatial corp during october 2003 spatial was ordered to reimburse autodesk for attorneys’ fees and trial costs 

interest income for fiscal 2004 includes 42 million related to a tax benefit realized during the second quarter of fiscal 2004 resulting from the favorable resolution with the irs of an industrywide issue regarding foreign sales corporations 

  

provision for income taxes 

autodesk accounts for income taxes and the related accounts under the liability method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 109 “accounting for income taxes” deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the basis differences reverse 

our effective tax rate increased four percentage points from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 the increase was primarily the result of a decrease in tax benefits as a percentage of pretax earnings from 1 the lapse of the statute of limitations which resulted in the release of tax reserves with respect to prior tax years and 2 the repatriation of certain foreign dividends at a rate lower than the 35 federal statutory rate under the american jobs creations act of 2004 “drd legislation” the current year increase to the effective tax rate was also partially offset by an increase in tax benefits from international profits taxed at rates less than the us federal statutory rate 

our effective tax rate increased eight percentage points from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 this increase was primarily due to the absence of a 197 million income tax benefit resulting from a favorable resolution of an industrywide matter surrounding our foreign sales corporation during fiscal 2004 our effective tax rate also increased as a result of a decrease in tax benefits as a percentage of pretax earnings from the lapse of the statute of limitations which resulted in the release of tax reserves with respect to prior tax years the effective tax rate increase was also partially offset by 1 a benefit of 155 million related to the drd legislation in fiscal 2005 and 2 an increase in tax benefits from international profits taxed at rates less than the us federal statutory rate 

our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate extraterritorial income exclusion deduction for domestic production activities research credits taxexempt interest and changes in the tax law our adoption of sfas 123r in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 may also affect our future effective tax rate further during the past two fiscal years our effective tax rate has benefited from the repatriation of certain foreign dividends under the american jobs creations act of 2004 the provisions of which are not effective for future years 

for additional information regarding our income tax provision see note 5 “income taxes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of cash is from the sale of our products our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employeerelated expenses such as compensation and benefits as well as general operating expenses for marketing facilities and overhead costs in addition to operating expenses our primary uses of cash include funding our stock repurchase program and investing in our growth initiatives through business acquisitions see further discussion of these items below 

at january 31 2006 our principal sources of liquidity were cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 3775 million and net accounts receivable of 2614 million in addition we also have available a us line of credit facility which was established during fiscal 2006 this line of credit permits unsecured shortterm borrowings of up to 1000 million which is available for working capital or other business needs there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement at january 31 2006 see note 6 “borrowing arrangements” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on this line of credit 

during fiscal 2006 we generated 4152 million of cash from operating activities compared to 3731 million in fiscal 2005 this increase was primarily driven by higher revenue higher operating earnings higher deferred revenue and accounts payable balances partially offset by higher working capital uses of cash related to larger bonus and other incentive compensation amounts paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 

during fiscal 2006 we used 3380 million in net cash for investing activities compared to 1757 million generated from investing activities during fiscal 2005 the increase in cash used in investing activities during fiscal 2006 was primarily due to 2421 million used in business acquisitions alias compass colorfront cplan solid dynamics engineering intent and ast in addition we also utilized 2713 million for purchases of availableforsale marketable securities during the current fiscal year partially offset by 2040 million of sales and maturities of such securities these uses of cash for 

  

investing activities were primarily due to funds repatriated from europe and asia to the united states under the american jobs creation act of 2004 “drd legislation” during fiscal 2006 under the drd legislation we repatriated approximately 512 million to the united states where we can more effectively manage our cash and invest in our business during fiscal 2005 sales and maturities of availableforsale marketable securities were higher primarily due to the liquidation of certain marketable securities to fund the repurchase of our common stock as discussed below 

we used 3056 million in net cash for financing activities during fiscal 2006 compared to 3177 million during fiscal 2005 the major financing uses of cash in both periods were for the repurchase of our common stock we repurchased 117 million shares of our common stock for 4468 million during fiscal 2006 and repurchased 259 million shares for 5464 million during fiscal 2005 as of january 31 2006 205 million shares remained available for repurchase under our stock repurchase program we currently expect to continue making repurchases under this program our dividend payments declined to 34 million during fiscal 2006 compared to 135 million during fiscal 2005 this decline was due to the discontinuance of the payment of cash dividends after the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the dividend payment made during fiscal 2006 related to the dividend declaration made during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 these financing uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and stock purchase plans which amounted to 1446 million during fiscal 2006 and 2422 million during fiscal 2005 

longterm cash requirements other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the development of new software products and incremental product offerings resulting from the enhancement of existing products financing anticipated growth the share repurchase program the acquisition of businesses software products or technologies complementary to our business and capital expenditures including the purchase and implementation of internaluse software applications 

as noted above during fiscal 2006 we repatriated approximately 512 million of foreign earnings held by financial institutions outside of the united states under the drd legislation as a result at january 31 2006 40 of our consolidated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are held with financial institutions in the united states compared to 10 at january 31 2005 for further discussion of the drd legislation see note 5 “income taxes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in addition 224 million of our marketable securities at january 31 2006 is reserved for deferred compensation see note 4 “restricted financial instruments” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations to minimize the impact of these fluctuations we use foreign currency option contracts to hedge our exposure on anticipated transactions and forward contracts to hedge our exposure on firm commitments primarily certain receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies our foreign currency instruments by policy have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period the principal currencies hedged during fiscal 2006 were the euro swiss franc canadian dollar british pound and japanese yen we monitor our foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at january 31 2006 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at january 31 2006 

 

  for the purposes of this table contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on autodesk and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies services and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on 

  

our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies services or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however in most instances the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty in addition we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products royalty expense is generally based on the number of units shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue royalty expense included in cost of license and other revenues was 121million 92 million and 86 million in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

principal commitments at january 31 2006 shown above consisted of obligations under operating leases for facilities and computer equipment it infrastructure costs marketing costs and contractual development costs purchase commitments also include 155 million related to a termination fee for an outsource application hosting services agreement entered into during fiscal 2006 this fee is reduced as time lapses during the fiveyear contract period 

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees including limited product warranties historically costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant but because potential future costs are highly variable we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than operating leases we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing arrangements or have any variableinterest entities as of january 31 2006 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

stock compensation 

as of january 31 2006 we maintained two active stock option plans for the purpose of granting stock options to employees and members of autodesk’s board of directors the 1996 stock plan available only to employees and the 2000 directors’ option plan available only to nonemployee directors additionally there are six expired or terminated plans with options outstanding including the nonstatutory stock option plan available only to nonexecutive employees and consultants which was terminated by the board of directors in december 2004 on november 10 2005 our stockholders approved a new stock plan the 2006 employee stock plan as well as amendments to the 2000 directors’ option plan see item 4 “submission of matters to a vote of security holders” for voting results of these proposals the 2006 employee stock plan reserves 965 million shares of autodesk common stock plus the shares that remained available for issuance under the 1996 stock plan upon its expiration for issuance under the plan the 2006 employee stock plan which will expire in fiscal year 2009 is limited to grants of stock options to employees the 2006 employee stock plan replaced the 1996 plan on march 21 2006 

in addition to its stock option plans our employees are also eligible to participate in autodesk’s 1998 employee qualified stock purchase plan 

our stock option program is broadbased and designed to promote longterm retention essentially all of our employees participate approximately 85 of the options we granted during fiscal 2006 were awarded to employees other than our ceo and the four other most highly compensated officers for fiscal 2005 which we refer to as our named executive officers options granted under our equity plans during fiscal 2006 vest over periods ranging from one to four years and expire within six to ten years of the date of grant options granted prior to fiscal 2006 expire within ten years of the date of grant the exercise price of the stock options is equal to the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market on the grant date 

all stock option grants to executive officers are made by the compensation and human resources committee of the board of directors all members of the compensation and human resources committee are independent directors as defined by the listing standards of the nasdaq national market grants to our nonemployee directors are nondiscretionary and are predetermined by the terms of the 2000 directors’ option plan 

for further information concerning autodesk’s policies and procedures regarding the use of stock options see a “policies related to our equity compensation programs” in the proxy statement for our special meeting of stockholders which was held on november 10 2005 and b “report of the compensation and human resources committee of the board of directors” in the proxy statement for our 2005 annual meeting off stockholders 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our revenues earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage our foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations but such contracts do not extend beyond the current quarter contracts are primarily denominated in euro swiss franc canadian dollar british pounds and japanese yen we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

a sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january 31 2006 indicated that a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 31 2006 would increase the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by 55 million conversely a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the dollar from its value at january 31 2006 would decrease the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by 22 million the results of the sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january 31 2005 indicated that a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 31 2005 would have increased the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by 80 million and a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the dollar from its value at january 31 2005 would have decreased the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by 62 million we do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows as a result of these foreign currency forward and option contracts 

interest rate sensitivity 

at january 31 2006 we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities and short term mutual fund balances of 903 million these securities were not subject to interest rate fluctuations at january 31 2005 we had an investment portfolio of 150 million consisting of short term mutual fund balances which were not subject to interest rate fluctuations the shortterm mutual fund balances included 224 million at january 31 2006 and 143 million at january 31 2005 of amounts held in a rabbi trust under deferred compensation arrangements see note 4 “restricted financial instruments” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy guidelines which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue issuer or type of instrument

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

our management evaluated with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 i is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and ii is accumulated and communicated to autodesk’s management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management our disclosure controls and procedures include components of our internal control over financial reporting management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is expressed at the level of reasonable assurance because a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended january 31 2006 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2006 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal controlintegrated framework as allowed pursuant to guidance from the securities and exchange commission we have excluded from our evaluation the internal control over financial reporting of alias systems which we acquired on january 10 2006 as of and for the year ended january 31 2006 revenues and net income of alias systems represented less than 1 of consolidated revenues and less than 1 of net income respectively and total assets and net tangible assets of alias systems represented 3 of consolidated total assets and 2 of net tangible assets respectively our management has concluded that as of january 31 2006 our internal control over financial reporting is effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp have issued an audit report on our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting which is included herein 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within autodesk have been detected

under the current autodesk upgrade program a customer who is on a currently supported version of a product which is generally the prior three versions can upgrade to the latest release of the product typically the cost to upgrade is based on a multiple of the number of versions the customer is upgrading 

  

product development and introduction 

  

we continue to enhance our product offerings and develop new products to meet changing customer demands research and development expenditures were 2394 million or 19 of fiscal 2005 net revenues 2093 million or 22 of fiscal 2004 net revenues and 1903 million or 23 of fiscal 2003 net revenues our software is primarily developed internally however we do use independent contractors to supplement our development efforts additionally we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing some or all of the assets or stock of the entity that held ownership rights to the technology during fiscal 2005 approximately 6 of our total research and development expenditures were attributable to development work performed by a single independent contractor on behalf of our manufacturing solutions division 

  

the majority of our basic research and product development is performed in the us and canada while translation and localization of foreignmarket versions as well as some product development is performed by development teams or contractors in our local markets we generally translate and localize our products into french italian german spanish japanese and various chinese dialects portions of product development including some software development localization quality assurance and technical publications are performed in europe and asia including india singapore china and the united kingdom we plan to significantly increase our product development operations in the asiapacific region over the next several years particularly in china 

  

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware operating systems and software as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences to keep pace with these changes we maintain an aggressive program of new product development to address demands in the marketplace for our products we dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to further enhance our existing products and to create new products and technologies however these investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs or our competitors may introduce new products and services that achieve acceptance among our current customers either of which would likely adversely affect our competitive position 

  

our software products are complex and despite extensive testing and quality control may contain errors or defects these defects or errors could result in corrective releases to our software products damage to our reputation loss of revenues an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products any of which would likely harm our business 

  

we actively recruit and hire experienced software developers and license and acquire complementary software technologies and businesses in addition we actively collaborate with and support independent software developers who offer products that enhance and complement our products 

  

independent firms and contractors perform some of our product development activities because talented development personnel are in high demand these independent firms and contractors may not be able to provide development support to us in the future in addition we license some technology from third parties use of this licensed technology may be restricted in ways that negatively affect our business we may not be able to obtain and renew existing license agreements on favorable terms if at all and any failure to do so would likely harm our business 

  

in addition our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with a network of thirdparty developers who develop their own products that expand the functionality of our software some thirdparty developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn these disruptions could negatively impact these thirdparty developers and in turn end users which could harm our business 

  

marketing and sales 

  

we sell our products and services both through authorized distributors and resellers and directly to customers primarily large corporations our customerrelated operations are divided into three geographic regions the americas europemiddle eastafrica and asiapacific and are supported by global marketing and sales organizations these organizations develop and manage overall marketing and sales programs and work closely with a network of domestic and foreign offices 

  

we also work directly with reseller and distributor sales organizations computer manufacturers other software developers and peripheral manufacturers in cooperative advertising promotions and tradeshow presentations we employ massmarketing techniques such as web casts seminars telemarketing direct mailings and advertising in business and trade journals we have a worldwide user group organization dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products 

  

our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller networks computer software dealers and distributors are typically not highly capitalized and have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and may do so in the future while we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of dealers and distributors prior to sales to them if their financial condition were to deteriorate they might not be able to make repeat purchases the loss of or a significant reduction in business with any one of our major international distributors or large us resellers could harm our business 

  

we intend to continue to make our products available in foreign languages we believe that international sales will continue to comprise a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues economic weakness in any of the countries where we generate a significant portion of our net revenues would likely have a material adverse effect on our business a summary of our financial information by geographic location is found in note 11 “segments” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

customer and reseller support 

  

we provide technical support and training to customers through a leveraged model augmented by programs designed to address some specific needs directly end users rely primarily on their resellers and distributors for technical support however we do provide certain direct support for our highend discreet segment hardware systems we support the resellers and distributors through technical product training sales training classes the internet and direct telephone support we also provide optional online support directly to end users through our subscription program and support content is also available on the product support portion of our internet site there are also a number of user group forums in which customers are able to share information 

  

developer programs 

  

one of our key strategies is to maintain an openarchitecture design of our software products to facilitate thirdparty development of complementary products and industryspecific software solutions this approach enables customers and third parties to customize our products for a wide variety of highly specific uses we offer several programs that provide marketing sales technical support and programming tools to developers who develop addon applications for our products 

  

backlog 

  

we typically ship products shortly after receipt of an order which is common in the software industry our backlog is primarily comprised of deferred revenue deferred revenue is derived from our subscription program services and deferred license sales backlog also includes current software license product orders which have not yet shipped the category of current software license product orders which we have not yet shipped consists of orders from customers with approved credit status for currently available license software products and may include both orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period we typically experience temporarily higher levels of this component of backlog for quarters in which we retire a release of autocad as we did in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 aggregate backlog at january 31 2005 and january 31 2004 was approximately 2262 million and 1592 million respectively of which 320 million and 319 million related to current software license product orders which had not yet shipped at the end of each respective fiscal year in accordance with usual trends we anticipate a reduction of backlog related to software license product orders which had not yet shipped during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 we do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results 

  

competition 

  

we compete with a variety of companies in different aspects of our business 

  

in our design solutions segment our primary global competitors include dassault systemes and its subsidiary solidworks corporation parametric technology corporation ugs corp bentley systems inc and environmental systems research institute inc esri in our discreet segment our primary competitors include avid technology alias systems and apple computer 

  

in addition in each of our markets there are numerous regional and specialized software and services companies with which we compete 

  

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of desktop computers with continually expanding performance capacity at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the design software market is 

  

characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies in addition the availability of thirdparty application software is a competitive factor within all of our markets 

  

because of these and other factors competitive conditions in these industries are likely to continue to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenues and profit margins and loss of market share any of which could harm our business furthermore some of our competitors have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources 

  

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer new products and to continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to ease of use reliability performance range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation price and training 

  

intellectual property and licenses 

  

we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions nonetheless our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws enforcement of copyrights against alleged infringers can sometimes lead to costly litigation and counterclaims our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business 

  

from time to time we receive claims alleging infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights including patents disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to among other things costly litigation or product shipment delays which could harm our business 

  

we retain ownership of software we develop all software is licensed to users and provided in object code pursuant to either shrinkwrap embedded or online licenses or signed license agreements these agreements contain restrictions on duplication disclosure and transfer 

  

we believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our intellectual property and the rapid ongoing technological changes in both the computer hardware and software industries we must rely principally upon software engineering and marketing skills to maintain and enhance our competitive market position 

  

while we have recovered some revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the full extent to which piracy of our software products exists we believe however that software piracy is and can be expected to be a persistent problem 

  

production and suppliers 

  

production of our design solutions segment and certain discreet segment software products involves duplication of the software media and the printing of user manuals the purchase of media and the transfer of the software programs onto media for distribution to customers are performed by us and by licensed subcontractors media for our products include cdroms which are available from multiple sources user manuals for our products and packaging materials are produced to our specifications by outside sources production is generally performed in leased facilities operated by us some product assembly is also performed by independent thirdparty contractors to date we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the production of our software and documentation 

  

in addition the discreet segment has historically relied on thirdparty vendors for the supply of hardware components used in its systems many of discreet’s software products currently run on workstations manufactured by silicon graphics inc “sgi” there are significant risks associated with this reliance on sgi and we may be impacted by unforeseen difficulties associated with adapting our products to future sgi products and the timing of the development and release of sgi products we continue development of discreet segment products for use on alternative platforms eg linux to help mitigate these risks 

  

employees 

  

as of january 31 2005 we employed 3477 people none of our employees in the united states are represented by a labor union however in certain foreign countries our employees are represented by worker councils we have never experienced any work 

  

stoppages and believe our employee relations are good reliance upon employees in other countries entails various risks that possible further government instability or regulation unfavorable to foreign owned businesses could negatively impact our business in the future 

  

competition in recruiting personnel in the software industry especially highly skilled engineers is intense we believe our continued growth and future success is highly dependent on our continued ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees 

  

business combinations 

  

over the past three years we acquired new technology or supplemented our technology by purchasing businesses focused in specific markets or industries during this time period we acquired the following businesses

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

on december 27 2001 spatial corp “spatial” filed suit in marin county superior court against autodesk and one of our consultants dcubed ltd seeking among other things termination of a development and license agreement between spatial and autodesk and an injunction preventing autodesk from working with contractors under the agreement on october 2 2003 a jury found that autodesk did not breach the agreement as the prevailing party in the action the court awarded autodesk approximately 24 million for reimbursement of attorneys’ fees and the costs of trial which was paid during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 spatial filed a notice of appeal on december 2 2003 appealing the decision of the jury spatial claims that certain testimony of a witness should not have been considered by the jury and as a result spatial asserts that it is entitled to a new trial autodesk filed its opposition to spatial’s appeal in august 2004 at the present time the appeal has not been set for hearing by the appellate court after reviewing the arguments made in the appeal we believe the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material effect on autodesk’s financial position results of operations or cash flows however it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of this matter could occur and materially affect our future results of operations cash flows or financial position in a particular period 

  

on may 13 2004 nuvo services llc “nuvo” filed suit in united states district court district of arizona against autodesk seeking to compel arbitration of nuvo’s claim that autodesk breached a contract that allegedly existed between nuvo and a company acquired by buzzsawcom in 2000 in march 2005 the parties entered into a settlement agreement resolving all claims and counterclaims among them the resolution of this matter will not materially affect our future results of operations cash flows or financial position 

  

on september 22 2004 plaintiff z4 technologies inc “z4” filed suit against autodesk and microsoft corporation in the united states district court eastern district of texas alleging infringement of us patent no 6044471 entitled “method and apparatus for securing software to reduce unauthorized use” and us patent no 6785825 entitled “method for securing software to decrease software piracy” z4’s complaint alleges that autodesk infringes the ‘471 patent and the ‘825 patent by making using selling and offering for sale the claimed matter of these patents without the plaintiff’s authority z4 seeks unspecified compensatory damages injunctive relief and fees and costs we believe the allegations made in the complaint have no merit and intend to vigorously defend against the case while autodesk believes the ultimate resolution of this case will not have a material effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of this matter could occur and materially affect our future results of operations cash flows or financial position in a particular period 

  

in connection with our antipiracy program designed to enforce copyright protection of our software and conducted both internally and through the business software alliance “bsa” we from time to time undertake litigation against alleged copyright infringers such lawsuits may lead to counter claims alleging improper use of litigation or violation of other local law and have recently increased in frequency especially in latin american countries to date none of such counter claims has resulted in material damages and the company does not believe that any such pending claims individually or in the aggregate will result in a material adverse effect on our future results of operations cash flows or financial position 

  

in addition we are involved in legal proceedings from time to time arising from the normal course of business activities including claims of alleged infringement of intellectual property rights commercial employment piracy prosecution and other matters in our opinion resolution of pending matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or our financial position however it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more such proceedings could in the future materially affect our future results of operations cash flows or financial position in a particular period

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

we begin management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” with our overall strategy and the strategy for our major business units to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the direction in which our business and products are moving this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results in the next section beginning on page 21 we discuss our results of operations for fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 and for fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 beginning with an overview we then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows and discuss our financial commitments in the sections entitled “liquidity and capital resources” “contractual obligations” and “offbalance sheet arrangements” 

  

the mda should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form 10k including item 1 “business” item 6 “selected financial data” and item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

  

the discussion in our mda contains trend analyses and other forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 forwardlooking statements consist of among other things statements regarding anticipated operating expenses both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues future growth opportunities anticipated future net revenues revenue mix costs and expenses operating margins allowance for bad debts level of product returns planned annual release cycles and shortterm and longterm cash requirements as well as statements involving trend analyses and statements including such words as “we believe” and “plan” and similar expressions these forwardlooking statements are subject to business and economic risks as such our actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements as a result of the factors set forth below in “risk factors which may impact future operating results” and in our other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 

  

strategy 

  

our goal is to be the world’s leading design software and services company for the building manufacturing infrastructure media and entertainment and wireless data services fields our focus is to help customers create manage and share their data and digital assets more effectively and improve efficiencies across the entire lifecycle management processes 

  

we believe that our ability to make technology available to mainstream markets is one of our competitive advantages by innovating in existing technology categories we bring powerful design products to volume markets our architecture allows for extensibility and integration our products are designed to be easy to learn and use and to provide customers low cost of deployment low total cost of ownership and a rapid return on investment 

  

we have created a large global community of resellers third party developers and customers allowing us broad reach into volume markets our reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with global resources for the purchase support and training of our products in an effective and cost efficient manner we have a significant number of registered third party developers creating products that run on top of our products further extending our reach into volume markets our installed base of millions of users has made autodesk products a worldwide design software standard users trained on autodesk products are broadly available both from universities and the existing work force reducing the cost of training for our customers 

  

our growth strategy derives from these core strengths we continue to increase the business value of our desktop design tools for our customers in a number of ways we improve the performance and functionality of existing products with each new release and we have increased the frequency of our releases beyond our base design products we develop products addressing specific vertical market needs in addition we believe that migration from our 2d products to our higher priced 3d products presents a significant growth opportunity while the rate of migration to 3d varies from industry to industry adoption of 3d design software should increase the productivity of our customers and result in richer design data however this migration also poses various risks to us in particular if we do not successfully convert our 2d customer base to our 3d products as expected and sales of our 2d products decrease without a corresponding conversion of customer seats to 3d products we would not realize the growth we expect and our business would be adversely affected 

  

we believe the richer design data created by our 3d products requires better design information management tools also known as lifecycle management we believe that for each author of design information there are five to 10 users of that information downstream as a result we are developing and introducing products that will allow downstream users both within and external to our customer enterprises to manage and share their designs our large installed base provides a unique opportunity to sell additional products to design and engineering departments and to expand our customer base from these design and engineering departments to adjacent departments and into the supply chain 

  

expanding our geographic coverage is a key element of our growth strategy we believe that rapidly growing economies including those of china india eastern europe and south america present significant growth opportunities for the company in support of our growth efforts in china we opened our china application development center during fiscal 2004 with a level of understanding of local markets that could not be obtained from remote operations the center both develops products for the worldwide market and develops products to specifically address the chinese market in addition we believe that our products will have a competitive advantage as a result of being engineered locally we believe our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize product development and lower costs however international development whether conducted by us or independent developers on our behalf involves significant costs and challenges including whether we can adequately protect our intellectual property and derive significant revenue in areas such as china where software piracy is a substantial problem 

  

another significant part of our growth strategy is based upon improving the installed base business model a key element of this change is our ability to release major products on at least an annual basis strong annual release cycles have a number of benefits in particular they permit us to deliver key performance and functionality improvements to the customer on a regular and timely basis annual releases also drive annual product retirement programs thereby reducing the volatility of revenues we have experienced in the past as both the release of the new version and retirement of the oldest supported version are currently planned to happen annually volatility may also be reduced through the autodesk subscription program as revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription contract period 

  

we are continually focused on improving productivity and efficiency in all areas of the company doing so will allow us to increase our investment in growth initiatives and improve our profitability during fiscal 2004 we conducted a rigorous study of our cost structure through the services of a major consulting firm we benchmarked autodesk metrics against averages of other companies including other leading software companies as a result of the study we undertook a restructuring plan that concluded at the end of fiscal 2005 began implementing certain productivity and efficiency initiatives throughout the company and committed to continuous improvements in our productivity during fiscal 2005 we increased our operating margin from 11 to 19 while investing in growth initiatives longer term we intend to continue to balance investments in revenue growth opportunities with our goal of increasing our operating margins 

  

autodesk generates significant cash flow our uses of cash include share repurchases to offset the dilutive impact of our employee stock plans mergers and acquisitions investments in growth initiatives and through the end of fiscal 2005 a 0015 per share quarterly dividend the dividend was discontinued after the dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 which will be paid in april 2005 we evaluate merger and acquisition and divestiture opportunities to the extent they support our strategy our typical acquisitions are intended to provide adjacency to our current products and services specific technology or expertise and rapid product integration additionally we continue to invest in growth initiatives including lifecycle management and sales and market and channel development

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities net revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we regularly reevaluate our estimates and assumptions actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 

  

revenue recognition our accounting policies and practices are in compliance with statement of position 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended and sec staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” 

  

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 

  

for multiple element arrangements that include software products we allocate the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on their vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value vsoe is the price charged when that element is sold separately or the price as set by management with the relevant authority if we do not have vsoe of the undelivered element we defer revenue recognition on the entire sales arrangement until all elements are delivered we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 

  

our assessment of likelihood of collection is also a critical element in determining the timing of revenue recognition 

  

our product sales to distributors and resellers are generally recognized at the time title to our product passes to the distributor or reseller provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met this policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns we are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments regardless of whether they collect cash from their customers if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

  

in addition to product sales autodesk recognizes maintenance revenues from our subscription program and hosted service revenues ratably over the contract periods customer consulting and training revenues are recognized as the services are performed 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for bad debts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments our allowance for doubtful accounts was 72 million and 97 million at january 31 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

estimated allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based upon historical loss patterns the number of days that billings are past due and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with specific problem accounts the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different allowance balances while we believe our existing allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate and appropriate additional reserves may be required should the financial condition of our customers deteriorate or as unusual circumstances arise 

  

product returns reserves with the exception of contracts with certain distributors our sales contracts do not contain specific productreturn privileges however we permit our distributors and resellers to return product in certain instances generally when new product releases supercede older versions our product returns reserves were 153 million at january 31 2005 and 190 million at january 31 2004 product returns as a percentage of applicable revenues were 41 in fiscal 2005 54 in fiscal 2004 and 55 in fiscal 2003 

  

the product returns reserve is based on historical experience of actual product returns estimated channel inventory levels the timing of new product introductions channel sellin for applicable markets and other factors during fiscal year 2005 we recorded a reserve for product returns of 346 million which reduced our revenue 

  

while we believe our accounting practice for establishing and monitoring product returns reserves is adequate and appropriate any adverse activity or unusual circumstances could result in an increase in reserve levels in the period in which such determinations are made 

  

realizability of longlived assets we assess the realizability of our longlived assets and related intangible assets other than goodwill annually during the fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review significant underperformance of a business or product line relative to budget shifts in business strategies which impact the continued uses of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends and the results of past impairment reviews 

  

in assessing the recoverability of these longlived assets we first determine their fair values which are based on assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows that could reasonably be generated by these assets when assessing longlived assets we use undiscounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of the impairment charge impairment charges if any result in situations where the fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values 

  

in addition to our recoverability assessments we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our longlived assets any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made as well as in subsequent quarters 

  

we will continue to evaluate the values of our longlived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

  

goodwill as required under statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” we no longer amortize goodwill but test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

  

deferred tax assets we currently have 1193 million of net deferred tax assets mostly arising from net operating losses tax credits reserves and timing differences for purchased technologies and capitalized software offset by the establishment of us deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries we perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets which is principally dependent upon our achievement of projected future taxable income of approximately 3060 million in specific geographies our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors these changes if any may require possible material adjustments to these net deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determinations are made 

  

autodesk is a us based multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions the company’s effective tax rate is based on expected income statutory rates and enacted tax rules including transfer pricing significant judgment is required in determining the company’s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions on a worldwide basis the company believes its tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it conducts its business it is possible that these positions may be challenged which may have a significant impact on the company’s effective tax rate 

  

restructuring expenses during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 the board of directors approved a restructuring plan involving the elimination of employee positions and the closure of a number of offices worldwide this plan which we refer to as the fiscal 2004 restructuring plan was designed to improve efficiencies across the organization reduce operating expense levels to help achieve our targeted operating margins and redirect resources to product development sales development and other critical areas as a result of these restructuring activities which we completed by the end of fiscal 2005 and through attrition we achieved our targeted efficiencies with a lower level of involuntary terminations than originally anticipated consequently the total charges under the fiscal 2004 restructuring plan were 275 million as compared to the 370 million originally estimated 

  

during fiscal 2005 we recorded net restructuring charges of 267 million of which 198 million related to employee termination costs under the fiscal 2004 restructuring plan 39 million related to the closure of facilities under the fiscal 2004 restructuring plan and 30 million related to office closures effected during previous years the office closure costs were based upon the projected rental payments through the remaining terms of the underlying operating leases offset by projected sublease income the projected sublease income amounts were calculated by using information provided by thirdparty real estate brokers as well as management judgments and were based on assumptions for each of the real estate markets where the leased offices were located if real estate markets worsen and we are not able to sublease the properties as expected we will record additional expenses in the period when such rental payments are made this situation occurred during each of fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 we therefore recorded additional charges as a result of the inability to sublease abandoned offices if the real estate markets subsequently improve and we are able to sublease the properties earlier or at more favorable rates than projected we will reverse a portion of the underlying restructuring accruals which will result in increased net income in the period when such sublease becomes effective 

  

stock option accounting  we do not record compensation expense when stock option grants are awarded to employees at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of autodesk common stock on the date of grant we disclose in note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements the expense consistent with the method of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 “accounting for stock issued to employees” “sfas 123” the alternative fair value accounting provided for under sfas 123 requires use of option valuation models which require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected life of the option and expected future volatility changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate had we recorded compensation expense from stock option grants our net income would have been substantially less upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 – revised 2004 “sharebased payment” which replaces sfas 123 and supersedes apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” “apb 25” in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 see “recently issued accounting standards” below our operating margins and net income will be adversely affected 

  

legal contingencies  as described in item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 5 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations

in december 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123 – revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” which replaces sfas 123 and supersedes apb 25 sfas 123r requires the measurement of all employee sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options using a fairvalue based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of income this statement is effective for reporting periods beginning after june 15 2005 we are required to adopt sfas 123r starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas 123 will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition see note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share amounts for fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 as if we had used a fairvalue based method similar to the methods required under sfas 123r to measure compensation expense for employee stock awards although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas 123r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas 123 we are evaluating the requirements under sfas 123r and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of income and net income per share 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued fasb staff position no fsp 1092 “accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creations act of 2004 “fsp 1092”” see “provision for income taxes” under “results of operations” on page 27 and note 4 “income taxes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further description of the effects on the financial statements of fsp 1092 

  

in march 2004 the fasb issued emerging issues task force issue 031 “eitf 031” “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments” which provided new guidance for assessing impairment losses on investments additionally eitf 031 includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired in september 2004 the fasb delayed the accounting provisions of eitf 031 however the disclosure requirements remain effective for annual periods ending after june 15 2004 the required disclosures are included in note 3 “financial instruments” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we will evaluate the impact of eitf 031 once final guidance is issued 

  

in march 2005 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sab 107” “sharebased payment” which provides interpretive guidance related to the interaction between sfas 123r and certain sec rules and regulations as well as provides the sec staff’s views regarding the valuation of sharebased payment arrangements autodesk is currently assessing the impact of sab 107 on our implementation and adoption of sfas 123r 

  

overview of fiscal 2005 results of operations 

  

   

for fiscal 2005 our primary goals were to deliver another series of marketleading products and solutions to our customers to drive revenue growth and market share gains while increasing our profitability to an annual operating margin of 18 to 20 by fiscal 2006 we achieved both goals our fiscal 2005 product releases offered continued advancements in design and authoring productivity as well as project lifecycle management capability our operating margin for fiscal 2005 was 19 excluding the impact of our restructuring charge which was 2 of net revenues we exceeded our 18 to 20 target one year ahead of plan in addition as a result of planned continued revenue growth and our commitment to improve productivity we believe we will continue to expand our operating margins in fiscal 2006 excluding the impact of employee stock compensation expense under sfas 123r 

  

our net revenues were 30 higher in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 primarily due to strong new seat subscription and upgrade revenues coupled with the positive effects of changes in foreign currencies principally driven by the strength of the euro compared to fiscal 2004 new seat revenues increased 38 subscription revenues increased 54 and upgrade revenues increased 12 revenue growth was driven more by volume growth than price increases due to the strength of our current product releases particularly the autocad 2005 family of products and autodesk inventor 9 products and the announcement of our intention to retire the autocad 2000ibased product series during early calendar 2005 product retirements generally result in customer upgrades to a product series still supported by autodesk 

  

as a result of our retirement cycle for the autocad product series which typically occurs during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year our fourth quarters have higher than normal levels of product backlog product backlog is comprised of deferred revenue and current software license product orders which have not yet shipped the category of current software license product orders which we have not yet shipped consists of orders from customers with approved credit status for currently available license 

  

software products and may include orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period during the first quarter of the next fiscal year the component of product backlog attributable to product orders that have not yet shipped will decline significantly aggregate backlog at january 31 2005 and january 31 2004 was approximately 2262 million and 1592 million respectively of which 320 million and 319 million related to current software license product orders which have not yet shipped at the end of each respective fiscal year 

  

we generate a significant amount of our revenue in the united states japan germany united kingdom italy france china korea australia and canada the weaker value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies had a positive impact of 348 million on operating results in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 had exchange rates from fiscal 2004 been in effect during fiscal 2005 translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been 511 million lower and operating expenses would have been 163 million lower changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant impact on net revenues in future periods to reduce this impact for the current quarter we utilize foreign currency option collar contracts to reduce the current quarter exchange rate impact on the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions 

  

our operating expenses excluding restructuring increased 1087 million for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 but declined as a percentage of revenue the increase is due primarily to higher commission and bonus costs including related benefits and payroll taxes resulting from our improved financial performance as well as higher marketing costs offset in part by our efficiency initiatives and a reduction in salary expense due to our restructuring efforts our operating margins are very sensitive to changes in revenues given the relatively fixed nature of most of our operating expenses which consist primarily of employeerelated expenditures facilities costs and depreciation and amortization expense during fiscal 2006 we expect operating expenses ignoring the impact of employee stock compensation expenses to increase in absolute dollars but decline as a percentage of revenue as we balance investment in our growth opportunities with our focus on increasing profitability 

  

the required adoption of sfas 123r in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 will result in increased employeerelated expenditures related to the expensing of employee stock option grants and our employee stock purchase plan offering see note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

throughout fiscal 2005 we maintained a strong balance sheet and generated 3731 million of cash from our operating activities as compared to 2201 million in the previous year we finished the year with 5327 million in cash and marketable securities a higher deferred revenue balance and a relatively constant days sales outstanding position as compared to the previous year approximately 73 of the deferred revenues balance at january 31 2005 consisted of customer subscription contracts which will be recognized as maintenance revenue ratably over the life of the contracts which is predominantly one year 

  

  

results of operations 

  

net revenues 

  

    

fiscal 2005 net revenues compared to fiscal 2004 net revenues 

  

net revenues increased to 12338 million in fiscal 2005 from 9516 million in fiscal 2004 net revenues increased in all three of our geographic areas due primarily to strong subscription new seat and upgrade revenues coupled with the positive effects of changes in foreign currencies 

  

during the first part of fiscal 2004 customers in the industries we serve particularly manufacturing commercial construction and media and entertainment were impacted by economic pressures in their own businesses resulting in a difficult customer purchasing environment however by the end of fiscal 2004 and through fiscal 2005 we saw a lessening of these economic pressures 

  

license and other revenues for fiscal 2005 were 10571 million as compared to 8367 million in fiscal 2004 the increase was primarily due to increased new seat and upgrade revenues across all major products as a result of our new product releases and the announced retirement of the autocad 2000ibased product series for early calendar 2005 product retirements generally result in customer upgrades to a product series still supported by autodesk in addition changes in foreign currencies had a positive impact on revenue we expect significant upgrade revenues during fiscal 2006 as a result of new product releases across our divisions and the announcement of the january 2006 retirement of the autocad 2002based product series the remaining installed base of the autocad 2002 release at january 31 2005 is significantly larger in size compared to the remaining installed base of the autocad 2000i release at that same time last year however we expect upgrade revenue in future fiscal years to decline as more enduser customers migrate to our subscription program revenue from the sales of our services training and support are immaterial for all periods presented 

  

maintenance revenues consisting of revenues derived from the subscription program were 1767 million for fiscal 2005 as compared to 1149 million for fiscal 2004 as a percentage of total net revenues maintenance revenues were 14 and 12 for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 respectively our subscription program available to most customers worldwide continues to attract 

  

new and renewal customers providing them with a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of our newest releases and planned annual product release cycle and enhancements such as web support direct from autodesk and elearning we expect maintenance revenues to continue to increase as a percentage of total net revenues 

  

net revenues in the americas increased 25 to 5109 million in fiscal 2005 as compared to 4096 million in fiscal 2004 largely due to strong new seat upgrade and subscription revenue most of the first half of fiscal 2004 was impacted by the difficult selling environment experienced in the industries we serve however the later half of fiscal 2004 had strong upgrade and subscription revenues which carried into fiscal 2005 

  

net revenues in the europe middle east and africa “emea” region increased 32 to 4437 million in fiscal 2005 from 3372 million in fiscal 2004 due primarily to strong new seat upgrade and subscription sales as well as favorable exchange rates ignoring the effects of changes in foreign currencies during fiscal 2005 net revenues for emea increased approximately 20 in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 

  

net revenues in asiapacific increased 36 to 2792 million in fiscal 2005 from 2048 million in fiscal 2004 the increase in net revenues was due primarily to strong new seat subscription and upgrade revenues as well as favorable exchange rates revenues for fiscal 2004 were adversely affected by the impact on our sales operations of concerns regarding severe acute respiratory syndrome “sars” primarily during the second quarter of fiscal 2004 ignoring the effects of changes in foreign currencies during fiscal 2005 net revenues for asiapacific increased approximately 31 as compared to fiscal 2004 

  

for fiscal 2005 net revenues for the design solutions segment were 10773 million as compared to 8181 million in fiscal 2004 the increase in net revenues in fiscal 2005 for the design solutions segment was due primarily to strong new seat upgrade and subscription revenues and favorable exchange rates revenue from upgrades and subscriptions combined accounted for 38 of design solutions segment revenues for fiscal 2005 and 41 of design solutions segment revenue for fiscal 2004 maintenance revenue accounted for 16 of design solutions segment revenue for fiscal 2005 and 14 of design solutions segment revenues for fiscal 2004 although we have been shifting our focus to more verticallyoriented product lines sales of autocad autocad upgrades and autocad lt continue to comprise a significant portion of our net revenues such sales which are reflected in the net revenues for the platform technology division and other accounted for 45 of our consolidated net revenues for both fiscal 2005 and 2004 net revenues for our 3d products increased approximately 69 for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 a critical component of our growth strategy is to convert our 2d customer base including customers of autocad and related vertical industry products to our higher priced 3d products such as the autodesk inventor products autodesk revit building products and autodesk civil 3d however should sales of 2d products decrease without a corresponding conversion of the customer seats to 3d products our results of operations will be adversely affected 

  

net revenues for the discreet segment increased 16 to 1541 million in fiscal 2005 from 1331 million in fiscal 2004 primarily due to growth in new seat and subscription revenues of our 3ds max animation software an entire product line refresh of our editing and effects systems during fiscal 2005 and favorable exchange rates net revenues from our advanced systems products were 1104 million as compared to 919 million in fiscal 2004 

  

international sales accounted for 65 of our net revenues in fiscal 2005 as compared to 63 in the prior fiscal year ignoring the effects of changes in foreign currencies during fiscal 2005 international sales would have remained consistent at 63 of net revenues we believe that international sales will continue to comprise a significant portion of net revenues economic weakness in any of the countries which contribute a significant portion of our net revenues would have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

fiscal 2004 net revenues compared to fiscal 2003 net revenues 

  

net revenues increased to 9516 million in fiscal 2004 from 8249 million in fiscal 2003 net revenues increased in all three geographic areas due primarily to strong upgrade and subscription revenues coupled with the positive effects of changes in foreign currencies 

  

in fiscal 2003 and part of fiscal 2004 customers in the industries we serve particularly manufacturing commercial construction and media and entertainment were impacted by economic pressures in their own businesses resulting in a difficult customer purchasing environment during the last half of fiscal 2004 we saw a lessening of these economic pressures across the industries that constitute our customer base particularly in the manufacturing and media and entertainment sectors 

  

license and other revenues for fiscal 2004 were 8367 million as compared to 7489 million in fiscal 2003 the increase was primarily due to increased upgrade revenues across all major products as a result of our new product releases and the announced retirement of the autocad 2000based product series for january 2004 as well as the positive impact of changes in foreign currencies 

  

maintenance revenues consisting of revenues derived from our subscription program increased to 1149 million for fiscal 2004 as compared to 760 million in fiscal 2003 as our subscription program continued to attract new customers as a percentage of total net revenues maintenance revenues were 12 and 9 for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 respectively 

  

net revenues in the americas increased 9 to 4096 million in fiscal 2004 as compared to 3742 million in fiscal 2003 despite the difficult selling environment experienced during most of the first half of fiscal 2004 the overall increase was primarily due to strong upgrade and subscription revenue during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2004 

  

net revenues in the emea region increased 28 to 3372 million in fiscal 2004 from 2634 million in fiscal 2003 due primarily to strong upgrade and subscription sales and favorable exchange rates ignoring the effects of changes in foreign currencies during the year net revenues for emea increased approximately 10 as compared to fiscal 2003 

  

net revenues in asiapacific increased 9 to 2048 million in fiscal 2004 from 1873 million in fiscal 2003 the increase in net revenues was due primarily to strong upgrade and subscription sales offset in part by the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome “sars” especially in the greater china region during the second quarter of fiscal 2004 ignoring the effects of changes in foreign currencies during the year net revenues for asiapacific increased approximately 4 as compared to fiscal 2003 

  

for fiscal 2004 net revenues for the design solutions segment were 8181 million as compared to 7035 million in fiscal 2003 aggregate net revenues from sales of autocad and autocad lt products increased to 4322 million in fiscal 2004 from 3570 million in fiscal 2003 the increase in net revenues in fiscal 2004 for both the design solutions segment and combined autocad and autocad lt products was due primarily to strong upgrade and subscription sales coupled with favorable exchange rates revenue from new seat licenses accounted for 50 of design solutions segment fiscal 2004 revenues as compared to 65 for fiscal 2003 and upgrade revenue accounted for 27 of fiscal 2004 as compared to 15 for fiscal 2003 maintenance revenue accounted for 14 of total design solutions segment revenue for fiscal 2004 as compared to 11 in fiscal 2003 during fiscal 2004 and 2003 respectively sales of autocad autocad upgrades and autocad lt continue to comprise a significant portion of our net revenues such sales which are reflected in the net revenues for the platform technology division and other accounted for 45 and 43 of our consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2004 and 2003 respectively net revenues for our 3d products increased approximately 10 for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 

  

net revenues for the discreet segment increased to 1331 million in fiscal 2004 from 1194 million in fiscal 2003 this increase was due primarily to demand for new versions of our advanced systems products during early fiscal 2004 increased demand related to the release of a new generation of workstations by silicon graphics inc “sgi” late in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 and increased revenue from the most recent version of our 3ds max product released at the end of the third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2004 our advanced system products are generally sold as integrated solutions on workstations from sgi net revenues from our advanced systems products were 919 million during fiscal 2004 as compared to 801 million in fiscal 2003 

  

the weaker value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies had a positive impact on net revenues in fiscal 2004 had exchange rates from fiscal 2003 been in effect in fiscal 2004 translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been 578 million lower 

  

international sales accounted for approximately 63 of our net revenues in fiscal 2004 as compared to 61 in the prior fiscal year ignoring the effects of changes in foreign currencies during fiscal 2004 international sales would have remained consistent at 61 of net revenues 

  

cost of revenues 

  

   

cost of license and other revenues includes direct material and overhead charges royalties amortization of purchased technology and capitalized software hosting costs and the labor cost of fulfilling service contracts direct material and overhead charges include the cost of hardware sold mainly workstations manufactured by sgi for the discreet segment costs associated with transferring our software to electronic media printing of user manuals and packaging materials and shipping and handling costs 

  

cost of license and other revenues increased 15 or 197 million during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 due primarily to increased volume and changes in product mix and slightly higher royalty expenses for licensed technology embedded in our products cost of license and other revenues decreased 2 or 30 million during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 due primarily to changes in product mix 

  

cost of maintenance revenues includes direct costs of our subscription program amortization of capitalized software and overhead charges cost of maintenance revenues increased 10 during fiscal 2005 or 16 million as compared to fiscal 2004 due primarily to incremental direct program costs incurred as part of the expansion of the subscription program cost of maintenance revenues increased 52 during fiscal 2004 or 53 million as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to higher amortization of capitalized software related to underlying support systems and incremental direct program costs incurred as part of the expansion of the subscription program 

  

in the future cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues is likely to continue to be impacted by the volume and mix of product sales changing consulting and hosted service costs software amortization costs royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products new customer support offerings and the geographic distribution of sales in addition we expect the impact of expensing employee stockbased compensation as required under sfas 123r to further increase cost of sales in future periods 

  

marketing and sales expenses 

  

   

marketing and sales expenses include salaries dealer and sales commissions bonus travel and facility costs for our marketing sales order processing dealer training and support personnel and overhead charges these expenses also include costs of programs aimed at increasing revenues such as advertising trade shows and expositions and various sales and promotional programs designed for specific sales channels and end users 

  

the increase of 687 million between fiscal years 2005 and 2004 was due primarily to approximately 402 million of increased commission bonus and other incentive compensation expenses related to the increased sales volume approximately 233 million of higher advertising branding and promotion costs as well as costs related to a customer information and customer support software project offset in part by restructuringrelated cost savings 

  

the increase of 355 million between fiscal years 2004 and 2003 was due primarily to increased commission bonus and other incentive compensation expenses of 213 million related to the increased sales volume as well as higher marketing costs related to new product introductions 

  

we expect to continue to invest in marketing and sales of our products to develop market opportunities and to promote our competitive position and as a result expect marketing and sales expenses to continue to be significant both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in addition we expect the impact of expensing employee stockbased compensation as required under sfas 123r to further increase sales and marketing expenses in future periods 

  

research and development expenses 

  

   

research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries benefits and bonuses for software engineers contract development fees purchased inprocess technology depreciation of computer equipment used in software development and overhead charges 

  

the increase of 301 million in research and development expenses between fiscal years 2005 and 2004 was due primarily to efforts to invest additional resources made available through restructuringrelated savings in certain growth initiatives employeerelated costs increased approximately 140 million in fiscal 2005 as compared to prior year of which approximately 109 million related to higher bonus accruals and benefits based on financial performance in addition we incurred 14 million related to localization of new product releases and approximately 111 million for purchased inprocess technology for our manufacturing solutions division of which 92 million related to technology purchased from one independent software developer the inprocess technology is intended for future releases of various products that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use 

  

the increase of 190 million between fiscal years 2004 and 2003 was due to higher bonus accruals based on the year’s financial performance higher costs associated with localizing our products for different markets worldwide and incremental development costs resulting from our acquisitions of linius technologies and via development corporation during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 

  

we expect that research and development spending will continue to be significant in future periods as we continue to invest in product development and continue to acquire new technology and as a result of expensing employee stockbased compensation as required under sfas 123r 

  

general and administrative expenses 

  

   

general and administrative expenses include our finance human resources legal costs and overhead charges 

  

the increase of 99 million between fiscal years 2005 and 2004 was due primarily to approximately 78 million of higher bonus accruals and benefits based on financial performance 24 million of stock compensation expense incurred in connection with the change in employment status of a senior executive officer offset in part by a reduction in itrelated expenses and headcount reductions due to restructuring efforts in addition general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2004 included the effects of a 25 million reversal of a litigation accrual related to the spatial matter see note 5 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion during fiscal 2005 we incurred significant incremental costs related to our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as required by the sarbanesoxley 

  

act of 2002 “sox” for fiscal 2005 we estimate that we incurred approximately 60 million during fiscal 2005 and approximately 04 million in fiscal 2004 which include external consulting and auditing fees and internal employee costs we expect that general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenues will continue to be significant in future periods due to ongoing costs related to sox compliance 

  

the increase of 111 million between fiscal years 2004 and 2003 was due primarily to higher bonus accruals based on the year’s financial performance offset in part by the reversal of the spatial legal accrual established in fiscal 2003 

  

in future periods we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as a result of the impact of expensing employee stockbased compensation as required under sfas 123r 

  

restructuring charges 

  

   

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 the board of directors approved a restructuring plan involving the elimination of employee positions and the closure of a number of offices worldwide originally having a total expected cost of 370 million this plan which we refer to as the fiscal 2004 restructuring plan was designed to improve efficiencies across the organization reduce operating expense levels to help achieve our targeted operating margins and redirect resources to product development sales development and other critical areas as a result of the restructuring activities completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and throughout fiscal 2005 and through attrition we achieved our targeted efficiencies with a lower level of involuntary terminations than originally anticipated consequently the total charges under the fiscal 2004 restructuring plan completed by the end of fiscal 2005 were 275 million rather than the 370 million estimate noted above of the 275 million approximately 234 million related to involuntary employee termination costs and approximately 40 million related to office closure costs as a result of the fiscal 2004 restructuring plan we expect to realize pretax savings of approximately 93 million per quarter resulting in an annual savings of approximately 370 million to be reflected across each ongoing cost and expense line item in the consolidated statements of income however a portion of these savings are being used to fund various growth initiatives inline with our corporate strategy consequently not all of these savings will directly reduce operating expenses but have helped contain cost increases across each expense category described above 

  

during fiscal 2005 we recorded net restructuring charges of 267 million of which 237 million related to the fiscal 2004 restructuring plan of this amount 198 million related to employee termination costs for 316 employees worldwide 186 in the united states and 130 outside the united states and 39 million related to the closure of facilities also we recorded net restructuring charges of approximately 30 million related to the fiscal 2002 restructuring plan for additional office closure costs originally established under the fiscal 2002 restructuring plan since the office closures in fiscal 2002 there has been a significant downturn in the commercial real estate market particularly in areas of the united kingdom where some of the offices are located as such autodesk is unable to either buyout the remaining lease obligations at favorable amounts or sublease the space at amounts previously estimated 

  

during fiscal 2004 autodesk recognized net restructuring charges of 32 million of which 38 million related to the fiscal 2004 restructuring plan 11 million related to additional office closure costs under the fiscal 2002 restructuring plan and reversals of the accrual for changes in estimates of 17 million related to underlying liabilities originally established under the fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2003 restructuring plans of the 38 million related to the fiscal 2004 plan 36 million related to employee termination costs for 86 employees worldwide 71 in the united states and 15 outside the united states and 02 million related to office closure costs office closure costs included losses on operating leases and the writeoff of leasehold improvements and equipment employee termination costs consisted of onetime termination benefits including severance benefits medical benefits and outplacement costs with respect to the 17 million of reversals the underlying liabilities primarily related to employee termination costs outside the united states were ultimately settled for less than originally estimated 

  

during the third quarter of fiscal 2003 the board of directors approved the fiscal 2003 restructuring plan which resulted in the termination of 394 employees worldwide 184 in the united states and 210 outside the united states and the closure of several additional international and domestic offices this plan was designed to help further reduce operating expense levels as well as redirect resources to product development and other critical areas 

  

during fiscal 2003 autodesk recognized net restructuring charges of 259 million of which 183 million related to the fiscal 2003 restructuring plan and 107 million related to additional costs associated with the fiscal 2002 restructuring plan offset by a 

  

credit of 21 million resulting from accrual reversals and a credit of 10 million related to the reversal of the remaining restructuring charges related to the fiscal 2000 restructuring program of the 183 million related to the fiscal 2003 restructuring plan 165 million related to employee termination costs and 18 million related to office closures of the 107 million associated with the fiscal 2002 restructuring plan 12 million related to the further consolidation of certain european offices and the remaining 95 million resulted from changes to estimated accrued liabilities related to vacated facilities during fiscal year 2003 we also reversed 21 million of accruals related to restructuring reserves established in fiscal 2002 the facilityrelated accruals were settled for less than originally estimated 

  

for additional information regarding the restructuring and other charges recorded over the past three fiscal years see note 9 “restructuring reserves” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

interest and other income 

  

the following table sets forth the components of interest and other income net in millions 

  

   

the investment income portion of the interest and investment income net line item fluctuates based on average cash and marketable securities balances average maturities and interest rates 

  

during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 we determined that certain money market fund investments were subject to 28 million of swiss transfer stamp taxes from the third quarter of fiscal 2001 through the second quarter of fiscal 2005 we determined that the impact of this adjustment was not material to previously reported periods 

  

legal proceedings settlement includes 24 million received during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 as part of a court settlement related to legal proceedings with spatial corp during october 2003 spatial was ordered to reimburse autodesk for attorneys’ fees and trial costs 

  

interest income for fiscal 2004 includes 42 million related to a one time tax benefit realized during the second quarter of fiscal 2004 resulting from the favorable resolution with the irs of an industrywide issue regarding foreign sales corporations 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

absent the impact of the onetime income tax benefits of 155 million relating to the dividends received deduction legislation “drd legislation” and 89 million relating to income tax audit closures our effective income tax rate was 20 in fiscal 2005 24 in fiscal 2004 absent the impact of the nonrecurring tax benefit from the resolution of the foreign sales corporation “fsc” issue and the closure of other tax audits and 27 in fiscal 2003 absent the impact of the nonrecurring tax benefit from the irs audit resolution for fiscal 19971999 the effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 is lower than the fiscal 2004 and 2003 tax rates primarily due to the new drd legislation and our belief that current year foreign earnings will be taxed at a rate lower than previously projected the effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 is less than the federal statutory rate of 35 due to the extraterritorial income exclusion “eti” research credits taxexempt interest and the tax benefits from lowtaxed foreign earnings and the drd legislation the effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 was less than the federal statutory rate of 35 due to the eti research credits and taxexempt interest 

  

our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate eti research credits taxexempt interest drd election and changes in the tax law which include but not limited to provisions such as the deduction for domestic production activities 

  

during fiscal 2005 autodesk recognized a onetime income tax benefit of 155 million relating to the new tax legislation surrounding the dividends received deduction legislation this drd legislation which was signed into law during the third quarter of fiscal 2005 as part of the american jobs creation act of 2004 allows for the repatriation of certain foreign dividends at a rate lower than the 35 federal statutory rate because autodesk believes that it will be able to repatriate foreign earnings under this drd legislation the deferred tax liability which was previously accrued on prior year foreign earnings was reduced which resulted in a 155 million onetime income tax benefit this onetime income tax benefit relates to the difference between the taxes previously provided on the earnings of a foreign subsidiary at the federal statutory tax rate and the lower rate afforded under the new drd legislation also during fiscal 2005 the company accrued 190 million of us and foreign deferred taxes relating to current year foreign earnings which the company intends to repatriate in fiscal 2006 under this drd legislation the net tax expense represents the company’s intention to repatriate approximately 2480 million of foreign earnings accumulated through fiscal 2005 under this drd legislation 

  

also as a result of the company’s resolution and closure of its internal revenue service “irs” audit for fiscal 2001 as well as the closure of certain state and foreign tax years and the lapse of the statute of limitations with respect to certain federal state and foreign tax years autodesk recognized a current income tax benefit of approximately 89 million during fiscal 2005 which reduced accrued income taxes 

  

during fiscal 2005 following certain business changes autodesk completed an internal reorganization of the ownership of autodesk canada as a result of the reorganization autodesk believes that it will be able to claim us tax deductions for the remaining unamortized portion of the purchase price from the march 1999 acquisition of discreet now autodesk canada the amount of the potential deferred tax asset arising from this reorganization is approximately 962 million reflecting future us tax amortization deductions of goodwill and other intangible assets autodesk determined that at the present time it is not probable that these tax benefits will be realized and accordingly has not yet recognized these benefits instead the tax benefits arising from this reorganization will be recognized if and when the tax treatment is verified with tax authorities or such other factors occur that would permit a probable confidence level to be achieved 

  

during fiscal 2004 we recognized an income tax benefit of 197 million due to a favorable resolution of an industrywide matter surrounding our fsc for the fiscal years ended 1993 through 1998 in connection with the refund of these tax payments previously made the company received payment and recognized interest income of 42 million during fiscal 2004 

  

also during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we recognized a nonrecurring income tax benefit of 70 million resulting from the resolution of an irs audit for the fiscal year ended 2000 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

our primary source of cash is receipts from revenue the primary uses of cash are employeerelated compensation and related benefits general operating expenses marketing facilities and overhead and cost of revenues in addition we receive cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of employee stock purchase plan shares and use cash to repurchase outstanding autodesk shares under our share repurchase program 

  

at january 31 2005 our principal sources of liquidity were cash and marketable securities totaling 5327 million and net accounts receivable of 1968 million during fiscal 2005 we generated 3731 million of cash from operating activities as compared to 2201 million in fiscal 2004 working capital sources of cash included increases in accrued compensation of 513 million related to bonus and other incentive compensation accruals as well as a 514 million increase in current deferred revenues reflecting higher subscription sales working capital uses of cash included an increase of 300 million in accounts receivable primarily due to higher revenue our days sales outstanding improved to 50 days at january 31 2005 compared to 51 days at the end of fiscal 2004 in addition cash from operations benefited from the significant movements in our deferred taxes resulting from the drd legislation and future tax benefits associated with employee stock option exercises 

  

during fiscal 2005 we generated 1756 million of cash from investing activities compared to net cash used of 590 million during fiscal 2004 the net generation of cash from investing activities during fiscal 2005 was due to significantly higher net sales of availableforsale marketable securities offset in part by slightly higher capital and other expenditures related to business combinations and a customer information and customer support software implementation as compared to fiscal 2004 this implementation is expected to provide us with improved operational efficiencies worldwide enable strategic decision making and drive customer satisfaction and future sales the total charges incurred in fiscal 2005 were 247 million of which 205 million were capitalized the total charges in fiscal 2004 were 76 million of which 46 million were capitalized we implemented the customer information and customer support software in certain geographies in march 2005 and expect to incur 56 million in fiscal 2006 to complete the implementation worldwide a larger portion of our internaluse software application development costs including those described above were required to be capitalized under generally accepted accounting principles during fiscal 2005 which resulted in a reduction of our itrelated project expenses certain marketable securities were liquidated to fund our repurchase of 259 million shares of our common stock as discussed below 

  

we used 3177 million in net cash for financing activities during fiscal 2005 compared to 765 million during fiscal 2004 the major financing uses of cash in both periods were for the repurchase of our common stock and the payment of dividends during fiscal 2005 we repurchased 259 million shares for 5464 million and during fiscal 2004 we repurchased 181 million shares for 1785 million at january 31 2005 approximately 322 million shares remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization of the board of directors we expect to continue our stock repurchase programs dividend payments were 136 million in fiscal 2005 and 134 million in fiscal 2004 as announced in december 2004 we discontinued the payment of cash dividends after the dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 which will be paid in april 2005 proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and stock purchase plans continue to be a principal source of cash from financing activities and amounted to 2422 million in fiscal 2005 and 1154 million in fiscal 2004 

  

during fiscal 2004 we had a us line of credit available that permitted unsecured shortterm borrowings of up to 400 million this credit facility expired in february 2004 we did not renew this facility as we believe our existing cash cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated shortterm and longterm cash requirements longterm cash requirements other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the development of new software products and incremental product offerings resulting from the enhancement of existing products financing anticipated growth the share repurchase program the acquisition of businesses software products or technologies complementary to our business and capital expenditures including the purchase and implementation of internaluse software applications 

  

at january 31 2005 approximately 10 of our consolidated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held with financial institutions in the united states the remaining balances are held with financial institutions outside the united states as a result of the passage of the dividends received deduction legislation in october 2004 we intend to repatriate up to 500 million of accumulated foreign earnings from our foreign operations to the us during fiscal 2006 where we can more effectively manage our cash and invest in our business for further discussion of the dividends received deduction legislation see note 4 “income taxes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements in addition 143 million of our marketable securities at january 31 2005 are reserved for deferred compensation 

  

our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations to minimize the impact of these fluctuations we use foreign currency option contracts to hedge our exposure on anticipated transactions and forward contracts to hedge our exposure on firm commitments primarily certain receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies our foreign currency instruments by policy have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period the principal currencies hedged during fiscal 2005 were the euro swiss franc canadian dollar british pound and japanese yen we monitor our foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at january 31 2005 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at january 31 2005 

  

    

for the purposes of this table contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on autodesk and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies services and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies services or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however in most instances the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty in addition we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products royalty expense is generally based on the number of units shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue royalty expense included in cost of license and other revenues was 92 million 86 million and 76 million in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

principal commitments at january 31 2005 consisted of obligations under operating leases for facilities and computer equipment it infrastructure costs marketing costs contractual development costs and certain capital expenditures related to the purchase and implementation of customer information and support management software and services 

  

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

  

we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees including limited product warranties historically costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant but because potential future costs are highly variable we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

other than operating leases we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing arrangements or have any variableinterest entities as of january 31 2005 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

  

stock compensation 

  

autodesk maintains two active stock option plans for the purpose of granting stock options to employees and members of autodesk’s board of directors the 1996 stock plan available only to employees and the 2000 directors’ option plan available only to nonemployee directors additionally there are six expired or terminated plans with options outstanding including the nonstatutory stock option plan available only to nonexecutive employees and consultants which was terminated by the board of directors in december 2004 in march 2005 the board of directors approved a new stock plan the 2006 stock plan which effectively replaces the 1996 stock plan on february 1 2006 subject to approval by the stockholders of the company 

  

in addition to its stock option plans the company’s employees are also eligible to participate in autodesk’s 1998 employee qualified stock purchase plan 

  

our stock option program is broadbased and designed to promote longterm retention essentially all of our employees participate approximately 84 of the options we granted during fiscal 2005 were awarded to employees other than our ceo and the four other most highly compensated officers options granted under our equity plans vest over periods ranging from one to five years and expire within ten years of the date of grant the exercise price of the stock options is equal to the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market on the grant date 

  

all stock option grants to executive officers are made by the compensation and human resources committee of the board of directors all members of the compensation and human resources committee are independent directors as defined by the listing standards of the nasdaq national market see the “report of the compensation and human resources committee of the board of directors” in our most recently filed proxy statement for further information concerning autodesk’s policies and procedures regarding the use of stock options grants to our nonemployee directors are nondiscretionary and are predetermined by the terms of the 2000 directors’ option plan 

  

risk factors which may impact future operating results 

  

we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks many of which are beyond our control the following discussion highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on future results of operations if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted causing the trading price of our common stock to decline 

  

because we derive a substantial portion of our net revenues from a limited number of products if these products are not successful our net revenues will be adversely affected 

  

we derive a substantial portion of our net revenues from sales of autocad software including products based on autocad that serve specific vertical markets upgrades to those products and products that are interoperable with autocad as such any factor adversely affecting sales of these products including the product release cycle market acceptance product performance and reliability reputation price competition economic and market conditions and the availability of thirdparty applications would likely harm our operating results 

  

in the discreet segment our customers’ buying patterns are heavily influenced by advertising and entertainment industry cycles which have resulted in and could have a negative impact on our future operating results in addition discreet’s advanced systems products rely primarily on workstations manufactured by silicon graphics inc “sgi” failure of sgi to deliver products or product upgrades in a timely manner would likely result in an adverse effect upon our financial results for a given period 

  

our operating results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenues and operating results difficult to predict 

  

our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include the timing of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors slowing of momentum in upgrade or maintenance revenue the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement sfas 123r that will require us to record compensation expense for shares issued under our stock plans beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 with a material impact on our results of operations failure to achieve anticipated levels of customer acceptance of key new applications unexpected costs or changes in marketing or other operating expenses changes in product pricing or product mix platform changes delays in product releases failure to convert our 2d customer base to 3d products distribution channel management changes in sales compensation practices the timing of large systems sales failure to effectively implement our copyright legalization programs especially in developing countries and general economic or political conditions particularly in countries where we derive a significant portion of our net revenues 

  

we have also experienced fluctuations in operating results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic conditions in particular our operating results in europe during the third quarter are usually affected by a slow summer period and the asiapacific operations typically experience seasonal slowing in the third and fourth quarters 

  

our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term accordingly any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability failure to continue to increase operating margins through rigorous cost controls would negatively affect future profitability further gross margins may be adversely affected if our sales of autocad lt upgrades and advanced systems products which historically have had lower margins grow at a faster rate than sales of our highermargin products 

  

while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 

  

pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “section 404” beginning with the annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended january 31 2005 we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting such report contains among other matters an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management such report must also contain a statement that our auditors have issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of such internal controls 

  

while we have determined in our management report on internal control over financial reporting included in this annual report on form 10k that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of january 31 2005 we must continue to monitor and assess our internal control over financial reporting if our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and such weakness remains uncorrected at fiscal year end we will be unable to assert such internal control is effective at fiscal year end if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective at fiscal year end or if our auditors are unable to attest that our management’s report is fairly stated or they are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which would likely have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 

  

existing and increased competition may reduce our net revenues and profits 

  

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of desktop computers with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the markets in which we compete are characterized by vigorous competition both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies in addition some of our competitors have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources furthermore a reduction in the number and availability of compatible thirdparty applications may adversely affect the sale of our products because of these and other factors competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future increased competition could result in continued price reductions reduced net revenues and profit margins and loss of market share any of which would likely harm our business 

  

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer products that compete favorably with respect to reliability performance ease of use range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation and price 

  

net revenues or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline 

  

the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including the following net revenues or earnings shortfalls unexpected deviations in results of key performance metrics and changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors quarterly variations in our or our competitors’ results of operations developments in our industry onetime events such as acquisitions divestitures and litigation and general market conditions and other factors including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 

  

in addition stock prices for many companies in the technology sector have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies historically after periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities a company becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management’s attention and resources 

  

our efforts to develop and introduce new products and service offerings expose us to risks such as limited customer acceptance costs related to product defects and large expenditures that may not result in additional net revenues 

  

rapid technological change as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences characterize the software industry we are devoting significant resources to the development of technologies like our lifecycle management initiatives and service offerings to address demands in the marketplace for increased connectivity and use of digital data created by computeraided design software as a result we are transitioning to new business models requiring a considerable investment of technical and financial resources such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs or competitors may introduce new products and services that achieve acceptance among our current customers adversely affecting our competitive position in particular a critical component of our growth strategy is to convert our 2d customer base including customers of autocad autocad lt and related vertical industry products to our 3d products such as autodesk inventor series or autodesk revit 

  

however should sales of autocad autocad upgrades and autocad lt products decrease without a corresponding conversion of customer seats to 3d products our results of operations will be adversely affected 

  

additionally the software products we offer are complex and despite extensive testing and quality control may contain errors or defects these defects or errors could result in the need for corrective releases to our software products damage to our reputation loss of revenues an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products any of which would likely harm our business 

  

we rely on third party technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies our product and service development may be delayed 

  

we rely on certain software that we license from third parties including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions these thirdparty software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and the software may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software could be developed identified licensed and integrated which would likely harm our business 

  

in addition for certain of our products and services we rely on third party hardware and services like the workstations supplied by sgi financial difficulties product line changes or even failure of these third parties like sgi may impact our ability to deliver such products and services and as a result may adversely impact our business 

  

disruptions with licensing relationships and third party developers could adversely impact our business 

  

we license certain key technologies from third parties licenses may be restricted in the term or the use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business similarly we may not be able to obtain or renew license agreements for key technology on favorable terms if at all and any failure to do so could harm our business 

  

our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with thirdparty developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn in particular markets this disruption would likely negatively impact these thirdparty developers and end users which could harm our business 

  

as a result of our strategy of partnering with other companies for product development our product delivery schedules could be adversely affected if we experience difficulties with our product development partners 

  

we partner with certain independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities we believe our partnering strategy allows us to among other things achieve efficiencies in developing new products and maintaining and enhancing existing product offerings 

  

accordingly our partnering strategy creates a dependency on such independent developers independent developers including those who currently develop products for us in the united states and throughout the world may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future in addition use of development resources through consulting relationships particularly in nonus jurisdictions with developing legal systems may be adversely impacted by and expose us to risks relating to evolving employment export and intellectual property laws these risks could among other things expose our intellectual property to misappropriation and result in disruptions to product delivery schedules 

  

our international operations expose us to significant regulatory intellectual property collections exchange fluctuations taxation and other risks which could adversely impact our future net revenues and increase our net expenses 

  

we anticipate that international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues and will provide significant support to our overall development efforts risks inherent in our international operations include the following unexpected changes in regulatory practices and tariffs difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales and development operations longer collection cycles for accounts receivable potential changes in tax laws tax arrangements with foreign governments and laws regarding the management of data greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property possible future limitations upon foreign owned business and the impact of fluctuating exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business 

  

our international results will also continue to be impacted by economic and political conditions in foreign markets generally or in specific large foreign markets these factors may adversely impact our future international operations and consequently our business as a whole 

  

our risk management strategy uses derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward and option contracts for the purpose of hedging foreign currency market exposures during each quarter which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations these instruments provide us some protection against currency exposures for only the current quarter significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currency markets may adversely impact our future net revenues 

  

general economic conditions may affect our net revenues and harm our business 

  

as our business has grown we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic and political conditions if economic growth in the united states and other countries’ economies is slowed many customers may delay or reduce technology purchases this could result in reductions in sales of our products longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition in addition weakness in the enduser market could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could in turn delay paying their obligations to us which would increase our credit risk exposure any of these events would likely harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our business could suffer as a result of risks associated with strategic acquisitions divestitures and investments 

  

we periodically acquire or invest in businesses software products and technologies that are complementary to our business through strategic alliances equity investments and the like for example in april 2004 we acquired certain assets of mechsoftcom in may 2004 we acquired unreal pictures and in june 2004 we acquired certain assets of desc inc the risks associated with such acquisitions or investments include among others the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the companies the failure to realize anticipated synergies and the diversion of management’s time and attention in addition such investments and acquisitions as well as business divestitures may involve significant transactionrelated costs we may not be successful in overcoming such risks and such investments acquisitions and divestitures may negatively impact our business in addition such investments and acquisitions have in the past and may in the future contribute to potential fluctuations in quarterly results of operations the fluctuations could arise from transactionrelated costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or writeoffs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions these costs or charges could negatively impact results of operations for a given period or cause quarter to quarter variability in our operating results 

  

if we do not maintain our relationships with the members of our distribution channel or achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough our ability to generate net revenues will be adversely affected 

  

we sell our software products both directly to customers and through a network of distributors and resellers our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our reseller network computer software dealers and distributors are typically not highly capitalized and have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and may do so in the future while we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of dealers and distributors prior to our sales to them if their financial condition were to deteriorate they might not be able to make repeat purchases in addition the changing distribution models resulting from increased focus on direct sales to strategic accounts or from twotiered distribution may impact our reseller network in the future we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions including tech data corporation who accounted for 12 of fiscal 2005 consolidated net revenue the loss of or a significant reduction in business with those distributors or resellers or the failure to achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough with any one of our major international distributors or large resellers could harm our business in particular if one or more of such resellers should be unable to meet their obligations with respect to accounts payable to us we could be forced to write off such accounts which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period 

  

product returns could exceed our estimates and harm our net revenues 

  

with the exception of contracts with some distributors our sales contracts do not contain specific productreturn privileges however we permit our distributors and resellers to return products in certain instances for example we generally allow our distributors and resellers to return older versions of products which have been superceded by new product releases we anticipate that product returns will continue to be impacted by product update cycles new product releases such as autocad 2005 and software quality 

  

we establish reserves for stock balancing and product rotation these reserves are based on historical experience estimated channel inventory levels and the timing of new product introductions and other factors while we maintain strict measures to monitor these reserves actual product returns may exceed our reserve estimates and such differences could harm our business 

  

if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights our business could be harmed 

  

we rely on a combination of patents copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties from time to 

  

time have copied aspects of our software products or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our software products is timeconsuming and costly while we have recovered some revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists and software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem furthermore our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop similar technology 

  

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 

  

as more and more software patents are granted worldwide as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows and as the functionality of products in different industry segments overlap we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims infringement invalidity claims or misappropriation claims may be asserted against us and any such assertions could harm our business litigation often becomes more likely in times of economic downturn additionally certain patent holders have become more aggressive in threatening litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents any such claims or threats whether with or without merit could be timeconsuming to defend result in costly litigation and diversion of resources or could cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in addition such royalty or license agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms if at all which would likely harm our business 

  

changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our results of operations 

  

changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business further such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective for example we currently are not required to record stockbased compensation charges to earnings in connection with stock option grants to our employees however the fasb issued sfas 123r which will require us to record stockbased compensation charges to earnings for employee stock option grants commencing in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 such charges will negatively impact our earnings 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

our revenues earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage our foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations but such contracts do not extend beyond the current quarter contracts are primarily denominated in euro swiss franc canadian dollar british pounds and japanese yen we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

  

a sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january 31 2005 indicated that a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 31 2005 would increase the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by 80 million conversely a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the dollar from its value at january 31 2005 would decrease the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by 62 million these results are similar to the results of the sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january 31 2004 which indicated that a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 31 2004 would have increased the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by 61 million and a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the dollar from its value at january 31 2004 would have decreased the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by 41 million we do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows as a result of these foreign currency forward and option contracts 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

at january 31 2005 we had an investment portfolio of 150 million consisting of short term mutual fund balances which are not subject to interest rate fluctuations these shortterm mutual fund balances consist primarily of amounts held in a rabbi trust under deferred compensation arrangements at january 31 2004 we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities including those classified as security deposits of 2473 million these securities were subject to interest rate fluctuations 

  

a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of january 31 2004 this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of 

  

plus 50 plus 100 or plus 150 basis points occurring in either six months or 12 months for the sixmonth time horizon the market value changes for a 50 100 or 150 basis point increase were reductions of 16 million 31 million and 46 million respectively for the 12month time horizon the market value changes for a 50 100 or 150 basis point increase were reductions of 13 million 27 million and 40 million respectively 

  

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy guidelines which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue issuer or type of instrument 

  

investments in privatelyheld businesses 

  

we have an investment portfolio that includes minority equity investments in several privatelyheld technology companies many of which are in the development stage we account for these minority equity investments using the cost method of accounting because our ownership interests are less than 20 and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence on the investees at january 31 2004 the remaining net book value of these investments was reduced to zero write downs of our investments in privatelyheld businesses totaled 06 million in fiscal 2004 and 34 million in fiscal 2003

 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

our management evaluated with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act of 1934 i is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and ii is accumulated and communicated to autodesk’s management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management our disclosure controls and procedures include components of our internal control over financial reporting management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is expressed at the level of reasonable assurance because a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met 

  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended january 31 2005 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of january 31 2005 in making this assessment our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” in internal controlintegrated framework our management has concluded that as of january 31 2005 our internal control over financial reporting is effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals our independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp have issued an audit report on our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting which is included herein 

  

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within autodesk have been detected

product development and introduction 

  

we continue to enhance our product offerings and develop new products to meet changing customer demands research and development expenditures represented 22 of fiscal 2004 net revenues 23 of fiscal 2003 net revenues and 20 of fiscal 2002 net revenues our software is primarily developed internally with occasional use of independent software developers additionally we acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing some or all of the assets or stock of the entity that held ownership rights to the technology 

  

the majority of our basic research and product development is performed in the us and canada while translation and localization of foreignmarket versions as well as some product development is performed by development teams or contractors in our local markets we generally translate and localize our products into french italian german spanish japanese and various chinese dialects portions of product development including some software development localization quality assurance and technical publications are performed in europe and asia 

  

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware operating systems and software as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences to keep pace with these changes we maintain an aggressive program of new product development to address demands in the marketplace for increased connectivity and use of digital data created by our products we dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to further enhance our existing products and to create new products and technologies however these investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs or our competitors may introduce new products and services that achieve acceptance among our current customers either of which would likely adversely affect our competitive position 

  

our software products are complex and despite extensive testing and quality control may contain errors or defects these defects or errors could result in corrective releases to our software products damage to our reputation loss of revenues an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products any of which would likely harm our business 

  

we actively recruit and hire experienced software developers and license and acquire complementary software technologies and businesses in addition we actively collaborate with and support independent software developers who offer products that enhance and complement our products 

  

independent firms and contractors perform some of our product development activities while other technologies are licensed from third parties licenses may restrict use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business we either own or license the software developed by third parties because talented development personnel are in high demand independent developers including those who currently develop products for us may not be able to provide development support to us in the future similarly we may not be able to obtain and renew existing license agreements on favorable terms if at all and any failure to do so would likely harm our business 

  

our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with thirdparty developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our software some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn these disruptions could negatively impact these thirdparty developers and in turn end users which could harm our business 

  

marketing and sales 

  

we sell our products and services both through authorized distributors and resellers and directly to customers primarily large corporations our customerrelated operations are divided into three geographic regions the americas europemiddle eastafrica and asiapacific and are supported by global marketing and sales organizations these organizations develop and manage overall marketing and sales programs and work closely with a network of domestic and foreign offices 

  

we also work directly with reseller and distributor sales organizations computer manufacturers other software developers and peripheral manufacturers in cooperative advertising promotions and tradeshow presentations we employ massmarketing techniques such as web casts seminars telemarketing direct mailings and advertising in business and trade journals we have a worldwide user group organization dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products 

  

our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our distributor and reseller networks computer software dealers and distributors are typically not highly capitalized and have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and may do so in the future while we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of dealers and distributors prior to sales to them if their financial condition were to deteriorate they might not be able to make repeat purchases while no single customer distributor or reseller accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net revenues in any of the past three fiscal years the loss of or a significant reduction in business with any one of our major international distributors or large us resellers could harm our business 

  

we intend to continue to make our products available in foreign languages we believe that international sales will continue to comprise a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues economic weakness in any of the countries which contribute a significant portion of our net revenues would likely have a material adverse effect on our business a summary of our financial information by geographic location is found in note 13 “segments” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

customer and reseller support 

  

we provide technical support and training to customers through a leveraged model augmented by programs designed to address specific direct needs end users rely primarily on their resellers and distributors for technical support however we do provide certain direct support for our highend discreet hardware systems we support the resellers and distributors through technical product training sales training classes the internet and direct telephone support we also provide optional online support through our subscription program and support content is also available on the product support portion of our internet site there are also a number of user group forums in which customers are able to share information 

  

developer programs 

  

one of our key strategies is to maintain an openarchitecture design of our software products to facilitate thirdparty development of complementary products and industryspecific software solutions this approach enables customers and third parties to customize our products for a wide variety of highly specific uses we offer several programs that provide marketing sales technical support and programming tools to developers who develop addon applications for our products 

  

backlog 

  

we typically ship products shortly after receipt of an order which is common in the software industry our backlog is primarily comprised of deferred revenue from our subscription program but also includes current software license product orders which have not yet shipped the category of current software license product orders which we have not yet shipped consists of orders from customers with approved credit status for currently available license software products and may include both orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period we typically experience temporarily higher levels of this component of backlog for quarters in which we retire a release of autocad as we did in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 aggregate backlog at january 31 2004 and january 31 2003 was approximately 1592 million and 975 million respectively although the backlog at the end of fiscal 2004 was higher than normal we do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is indicative of future results 

  

competition 

  

we compete with a variety of companies in different aspects of our business 

  

in our design solutions segment our primary global competitors include dassault systems and its solidworks subsidiary parametric technology corporation ugs plm solutions bentley systems and esri in our discreet segment our primary competitors include avid technology alias systems a division of silicon graphics inc and apple computer 

  

in addition in each of our markets there are numerous regional and specialized software and services companies with which we compete 

  

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of desktop computers with continually expanding performance capacity at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the design software market in particular is fairly mature and characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies in addition the availability of thirdparty application software is a competitive factor within all of our markets 

  

because of these and other factors competitive conditions in these industries are likely to continue to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenues and profit margins and loss of market share any of which could harm our business furthermore some of our competitors have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources 

  

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer new products and to continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to reliability performance ease of use range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation price and training 

  

intellectual property and licenses 

  

we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions nonetheless our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business 

  

from time to time we receive claims alleging infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights including patents litigation often becomes more likely in times of economic uncertainty disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to among other things costly litigation or product shipment delays which could harm our business 

  

we retain ownership of software we develop all software is licensed to users and provided in object code pursuant to either shrinkwrap embedded or online licenses or signed license agreements these agreements contain restrictions on duplication disclosure and transfer 

  

we believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our intellectual property and the rapid ongoing technological changes in both the computer hardware and software industries we must rely principally upon software engineering and marketing skills to maintain and enhance our competitive market position 

  

while we have recovered some revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists we believe however that software piracy is and can be expected to be a persistent problem 

  

production and suppliers 

  

production of our design solutions segment and certain discreet segment software products involves duplication of the software media and the printing of user manuals the purchase of media and the transfer of the software programs onto media for distribution to customers are performed by us and by licensed subcontractors media for our products include cdroms and diskettes which are available from multiple sources user manuals for our products and packaging materials are produced to our specifications by outside sources production is generally performed in leased facilities operated by us some product assembly is also performed by independent thirdparty contractors to date we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the production of our software and documentation 

  

in addition the discreet segment has historically relied on thirdparty vendors for the supply of hardware components used in its systems many of discreet’s software products currently run on workstations manufactured by silicon graphics inc “sgi” there are significant risks associated with this reliance on sgi and discreet may be impacted by unforeseen difficulties associated with adapting its products to future sgi products and the timing of the development and release of sgi products 

  

employees 

  

as of january 31 2004 we employed 3493 people none of our employees in the united states are represented by a labor union however in certain foreign countries our employees are represented by worker councils we have never experienced any work stoppages and believe our employee relations are good 

  

competition in recruiting personnel in the software industry especially highly skilled engineers is intense we believe our continued growth and future success is highly dependent on our continued ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees

 item 2 properties tableend   

we lease approximately 1234000 square feet of office space in 89 locations in the united states and internationally through our foreign subsidiaries our executive offices and the principal offices for domestic marketing sales and production are located in leased office space in san rafael california our san rafael facilities consist of approximately 270000 square feet under leases that have expiration dates ranging from 2004 to 2007 we and our foreign subsidiaries lease additional space in various locations throughout the world for local sales product development and technical support personnel during fiscal 2005 as part of our restructuring plan we expect to consolidate several domestic and international offices in an effort to further reduce operating expense levels

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

on december 27 2001 spatial corp “spatial” filed suit in marin county superior court against autodesk and one of our consultants dcubed ltd seeking among other things termination of a development and license agreement between spatial and autodesk and an injunction preventing autodesk from working with contractors under the agreement on october 2 2003 a jury found that autodesk did not breach the agreement the court ordered spatial to pay autodesh approximately 24 million for reimbursement of attorneys’ fees and costs of trial spatial filed a notice of appeal on december 2 2003 appealing the decision of the jury the notice does not specify the basis on which spatial intends to challenge the jury’s finding we do not know of any basis on which an appeal would be successful and accordingly believe the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material effect on autodesk’s consolidated statements of financial condition results of operations or cash flows however it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of this matter could occur and materially affect our future results of operations cash flows or financial position in a particular period 

  

we are involved in legal proceedings from time to time arising from the normal course of business activities in our opinion resolution of pending matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or our financial position however it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more such proceedings could in the future materially affect our future results of operations cash flows or financial position in a particular period

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

we begin management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” with our overall strategy and the strategy for our major business units to give the reader an overview of the goals of our business and the direction in which our business and products are moving this is followed by a discussion of the critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results in the next section beginning on page 18 we discuss our results of operations for fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 and for fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 beginning with an overview we then provide an analysis of changes in our balance sheet and cash flows and discuss our financial commitments in the sections entitled “liquidity and capital resources” “contractual obligations” and “offbalance sheet arrangements” 

  

the mda should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this annual report on form 10k including item 1 business” item 6 “selected financial data” and item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” 

  

the discussion in our mda contains trend analyses and other forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 forwardlooking statements consist of among other things statements regarding net revenues revenue mix costs and expenses gross margins allowance for bad debts level of product returns restructuring activity and shortterm and longterm cash requirements as well as statements involving trend analyses and statements including such words as “we believe” and similar expressions these forwardlooking statements are subject to business and economic risks as such our actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements as a result of the factors set forth below included in “risk factors which may impact future operating results” and in our other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission 

  

strategy 

  

our goal is to be the world’s leading design software and digital content company offering customers progressive business solutions through powerful technology products and services our focus is to help customers in the building manufacturing infrastructure and digital media sectors increase the value of their digital design data and improve efficiencies across the entire lifecycle management processes 

  

we believe that our ability to make technology available to mainstream markets is one of our competitive advantages by innovating in existing technology categories we bring powerful design products to volume markets our architecture allows for extensibility and integration our products are designed to be easy to learn and use and to provide customers low cost of deployment low total cost of ownership and a rapid return on investment 

  

we have created a large global community of resellers third party developers and customers allowing us broad reach into volume markets our reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with resources for the purchase support and training of our products globally in an effective and cost efficient manner we have a significant number of registered third party developers creating products that run on top of our products further extending our reach into volume markets our installed base of millions of users has made autodesk products a worldwide design software standard users trained on autodesk products are broadly available both from universities and the existing work force reducing the cost of training for our customers 

  

our growth strategy derives from these core strengths we continue to increase the business value of our desktop design tools for our customers in a number of ways we improve the performance and functionality of existing products with each new release beyond our general design products we develop products addressing specific vertical market needs in addition we believe that migration from our 2d products to our 3d products presents a significant growth opportunity while the rate of migration to 3d varies from industry to industry adoption of 3d design software should increase the productivity of our customers however this migration also poses various risks to us in particular if we do not successfully convert our 2d customer base to our 3d products then sales of our 2d products may decrease without a corresponding conversion of customer seats to 3d products which would harm our business 

  

additionally we are creating products to address our customers’ needs for better design information management tools also known as lifecycle management we believe that for each author of design information there are 5 to 10 users of that information whom we call downstream users we are developing and introducing products that will allow downstream users both within and external to our customer enterprises to manage and share their designs our large installed base provides a unique opportunity to grow from design and engineering departments to adjacent departments and into the supply chain 

  

expanding our geographic coverage is a key element of our growth strategy we believe that the rapidly growing economies in china and eastern europe present significant growth opportunities for the company in support of our growth efforts in china we opened our china application development center during fiscal 2004 with a level of understanding of 

  

local markets that could not be obtained from remote operations the center will develop products to specifically address the chinese market in addition we believe that our products will have a competitive advantage as a result of being engineered locally our ability to conduct research and development at various locations throughout the world allows us to optimize product development and lower costs international development however involves significant costs and challenges including whether we can adequately protect our intellectual property and derive significant revenue in areas where software piracy is a substantial problem 

  

a significant part of our growth strategy is based upon improving the installed base business model a key element of this change is our current plan to release major products on at least an annual basis strong annual release cycles have a number of benefits in particular it permits us to deliver key performance and functionality improvements to the customer on a regular and timely basis annual releases also drive annual product retirement programs thereby reducing the volatility of revenues we have experienced in the past as both the release of the new version and retirement of the oldest supported version happen annually volatility may also be reduced through the autodesk subscription program as revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription contract period 

  

we are continually focused on improving productivity and efficiency in all areas of the company doing so will allow us to increase our investment in growth initiatives during fiscal 2004 we conducted a rigorous study of our cost structure through the services of a top consulting firm we benchmarked autodesk metrics against averages of other companies as well as other leading software companies as a result of the study we are implementing efficiency initiatives throughout the company each division has short term and long term efficiency targets 

  

we believe that increases in our efficiency and productivity will allow us to increase investment in our growth initiatives while improving our profitability we are committed to achieving annual operating margins in the 18 to 20 target range by fiscal year 2006 this goal is based upon current generally accepted accounting principles and makes no attempt to consider the effect of future changes to those principles including the potential expensing of stock options which would have a material adverse effect on our operating margins longer term we will continue to balance operating margin targets with revenue growth opportunities 

  

autodesk generates significant cash flow our uses of cash include a 003 per share quarterly dividend share repurchases to offset the dilutive impact of our employee stock plans mergers and acquisitions and investments in growth initiatives we continually evaluate merger and acquisition and divestiture opportunities to the extent they support our strategy our typical acquisitions provide adjacency to our current products and services specific technology or expertise and quick 

  

product integration additionally we continue to invest internally in growth initiatives including lifecycle management and autodesk location services

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities net revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we regularly reevaluate our estimates and assumptions actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 “notes to consolidated financial statements” the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 

  

revenue recognition our accounting policies and practices are in compliance with statement of position 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended and sec staff accounting bulletin no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” 

  

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable however determining whether and when some of these 

  

criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 

  

for multiple element arrangements that include software products we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered elements based on their vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” of fair value which is the price charged when that element is sold separately or the price as set by management with the relevant authority we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 

  

our assessment of likelihood of collection is also a critical element in determining the timing of revenue recognition 

  

our product sales to distributors and resellers are generally recognized at the time title to our product passes to the distributor or reseller provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met this policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns we are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed and determinable payments regardless of whether they collect cash from their customers if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

  

in addition to product sales autodesk recognizes maintenance revenues from our subscription program and hosted service revenues ratably over the contract periods customer consulting and training revenues are recognized as the services are performed 

  

allowance for bad debts we maintain allowances for bad debts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments our bad debt reserve was 97 million and 92 million at january 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

estimated reserves are determined based upon historical loss patterns the number of days that billings are past due and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with specific problem accounts the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different allowance balances while we believe our existing reserve for doubtful accounts is adequate and appropriate additional reserves may be required should the financial condition of our customers deteriorate or as unusual circumstances arise 

  

product returns and price adjustment reserves with the exception of contracts with certain distributors our sales contracts do not contain specific productreturn privileges however we permit our distributors and resellers to return product in certain instances generally when new product releases supercede older versions at january 31 2004 and 2003 our product returns reserves were 206 million and 198 million respectively product returns as a percentage of applicable revenues were 54 in fiscal 2004 55 in fiscal 2003 and 60 in fiscal 2002 

  

for certain distributors in europe we offer incremental discounts or price adjustments ranging from less than 1 to 4 for certain qualifying sales at january 31 2004 and 2003 our price adjustment reserves were 42 million and 41 million respectively price adjustment claims as a percentage of applicable revenues were 31 in fiscal 2004 20 in fiscal 2003 and 03 in fiscal 2002 

  

the product returns and price adjustment reserves are based on estimated channel inventory levels the timing of new product introductions channel sellin for applicable markets historical experience of actual product returns and price adjustment rates and other factors the greater the channel inventory level or the closer the proximity of a major new product release such as autocad 2004 the more product returns we expect similarly the higher the applicable channel sellin or the higher the channel inventory level the more price adjustment claims we expect during fiscal year 2004 we recorded a reserve for product returns of 393 million and a reserve for price adjustments of 59 million both of which reduced our gross revenue 

  

while we believe our accounting practice for establishing and monitoring product returns and price adjustment reserves is adequate and appropriate any adverse activity or unusual circumstances could result in an increase in reserve levels in the period in which such determinations are made 

  

realizability of longlived assets we assess the realizability of our longlived assets and related intangible assets annually during the fourth fiscal quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review significant underperformance of a business or product line relative to budget shifts in business strategies which impact the continued uses of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends and the results of past impairment reviews 

  

in assessing the recoverability of these longlived assets we first determine their fair values which are based on assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows that could reasonably be generated by these assets when assessing longlived assets we use undiscounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows and discount rates variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of the impairment charge impairment charges if any result in situations where the fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values during fiscal 2004 we recognized an impairment charge of 18 million related to technology acquired as part of the software division of media 100 inc see note 10 “business combinations” in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

in addition to our recoverability assessments we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our longlived assets any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made as well as in subsequent quarters 

  

we will continue to evaluate the values of our longlived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

  

goodwill on february 1 2002 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” therefore we no longer amortize goodwill we test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

  

deferred tax assets we currently have 176 million of net deferred tax assets mostly arising from net operating losses tax credits reserves and timing differences for purchased technologies and capitalized software offset by the establishment of us deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries we perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets which is principally dependent upon our achievement of projected future taxable income of approximately 460 million in specific geographies our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors these changes if any may require possible material adjustments to these net deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determinations are made 

  

restructuring expenses in november 2003 the board of directors approved a restructuring plan that involves the elimination of between 550 and 650 positions and the closure of a number of offices worldwide this plan is designed to further reduce operating expense levels to help achieve our targeted operating margins as well as redirect resources to product development sales development and other critical areas the restructuring charge under this plan is estimated to be up to 370 million and is expected to be substantially complete by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2005 

  

during the fiscal year ended january 31 2004 we recorded gross restructuring charges of 49 million of which 36 million related to the elimination of positions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 under the fiscal 2004 restructuring plan 02 million related to the closure of a facility under the fiscal 2004 restructuring plan and 11 million related to the office closures effected during previous years the office closure costs were based upon the projected rental payments through the remaining terms of the underlying operating leases offset by projected sublease income the projected sublease income amounts were calculated by using information provided by thirdparty real estate brokers as well as management judgments and were based on assumptions for each of the real estate markets where the leased offices were located should real estate markets worsen and we are not able to sublease the properties as expected we will record additional expenses in the period when such rental payments are made this situation occurred during fiscal 2002 2003 and 2004 we therefore recorded additional charges as a result of the inability to sublease abandoned offices if the real estate markets subsequently improve and we are able to sublease the properties earlier or at more favorable rates than projected we will reverse a portion of the underlying restructuring accruals which will result in increased net income in the period when such sublease becomes effective 

  

legal contingencies  as described in item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 7 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters we base our loss reserves on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly results of operations 

  

stock option accounting  we do not record compensation expense when stock option grants are awarded to employees at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of autodesk common stock on the date of grant 

  

had we recorded compensation expense our net income would have been substantially less in addition if we are required to record compensation expense our ability to achieve our target operating margins will be adversely affected the impact of 

  

expensing employee stock awards is further described in note 1 “business and summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

recently issued accounting standards 

  

in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 “fin 46” “consolidation of variable interest entities” fin 46 expands upon existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets liabilities and activities of another entity a variable interest entity is a corporation partnership trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities fin 46 requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity’s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity’s residual returns or both the consolidation requirements of fin 46 apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january 31 2003 the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after december 15 2003 disclosure requirements apply to any financial statements issued after january 31 2003 the adoption of this statement had no effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in april 2003 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 149 “amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities” “sfas 149” sfas 149 amends and clarifies the accounting for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under statement of financial accounting standards no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” sfas 149 is generally effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after june 30 2003 adoption of sfas 149 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

in may 2003 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity” “sfas 150” which requires that certain financial instruments which under previous guidance were accounted for as equity must now be accounted for as liabilities sfas 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 and otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june 15 2003 the adoption of this statement had no effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

overview of fiscal 2004 results of operations 

  

   

for fiscal 2004 our primary goals were to deliver a series of marketleading products and solutions to our customers to drive revenue growth while increasing our operating efficiency to move our business model toward our longterm operating margin objectives we made considerable progress towards our goals our fiscal 2004 product releases offered continued advancements in design and authoring productivity as well as project lifecycle management capability 

  

our net revenues were 15 higher in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to strong upgrade and subscription revenues coupled with the positive effects of changes in foreign currencies principally driven by the strength of the euro upgrade revenues equally driven by price increases and volume growth increased 88 from the prior year due to the strength of our product releases and to the announcement of our intention to retire the autocad 2000based product series during early calendar 2004 in addition our autocadbased product installed base grew to nearly 34 million at the end of fiscal 2004 subscription revenues increased 51 from the prior year as our subscription program now available to most customers in most major markets worldwide continues to attract new customers with new enhancements such as web support direct from autodesk elearning and multiyear contracts 

  

we generate a significant amount of our revenue in the united states japan germany united kingdom italy china and canada the weaker value of the us dollar relative to international currencies had a positive impact of 343 million on operating results in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 had exchange rates from fiscal 2003 been in effect during fiscal 2004 translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been 578 million lower and operating expenses would have been 235 million lower 

  

our operating expenses excluding amortization of purchased intangibles and restructuring and other for fiscal 2004 increased 656 million but declined as a percentage of revenue as compared to fiscal 2003 the increase is due primarily to higher commission and bonus costs based on current financial performance as well as higher marketing costs our operating margins are very sensitive to changes in revenues given the relatively fixed nature of most of our operating expenses which consist primarily of employeerelated expenditures facilities costs and depreciation and amortization expense in future periods employeerelated expenditures would likely increase if we are required to expense employee stock option grants 

  

during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2004 with the help of a major consulting firm we analyzed our operations and cost structure we identified a number of opportunities to help achieve our targeted operating margins as well as redirect investments to the most promising growth areas such as product lifecycle management and development of our china sales and development infrastructure as we executed on these plans we began to incur restructuring charges beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we expect to incur additional charges through the third quarter of fiscal 2005 

  

throughout fiscal 2004 we maintained a strong balance sheet and generated 2201 million of cash from our operating activities as compared to 856 million in the previous year we finished the year with 5295 million in cash and marketable securities a higher deferred revenue balance and an improved days sales outstanding position as compared to the previous year approximately 65 of the deferred revenues balance at january 31 2004 consisted of customer subscription contracts which will be recognized as revenue ratably over the life of the contracts which is generally one year 

  

results of operations 

  

net revenues 

  

   

fiscal 2004 net revenues compared to fiscal 2003 net revenues 

  

net revenues increased to 9516 million in fiscal 2004 from 8249 million in fiscal 2003 net revenues increased in all three geographic areas due primarily to strong upgrade and subscription revenues coupled with the positive effects of changes in foreign currencies 

  

in fiscal 2003 and part of fiscal 2004 customers in the industries we serve particularly manufacturing commercial construction and media and entertainment were impacted by economic pressures in their own businesses resulting in a difficult customer purchasing environment during the last half of fiscal 2004 we saw a lessening of these economic pressures across the industries that constitute our customer base particularly in the manufacturing and media and entertainment sectors however uncertainty remains as to the sustainability of an economic recovery in the industries we serve 

  

license and other revenues for fiscal 2004 were 8367 million as compared to 7489 million in fiscal 2003 the increase was primarily due to increased upgrade revenues across all major products as a result of our new product releases and the announced retirement of the autocad 2000based product series for early calendar 2004 as well as the positive impact of changes in foreign currencies we expect significant upgrade revenues during fiscal 2005 as a result of new product releases across our divisions and the announcement of our retirement of the autocad 2000ibased product series in january 2005 the installed base of the autocad 2000i release is similar in size to the installed base of the autocad 2000 release 

  

maintenance revenues consisting of revenues derived from the subscription program were 1149 million for fiscal 2004 as compared to 760 million in fiscal 2003 as a percentage of total net revenues maintenance revenues were 12 and 9 for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 respectively our subscription program now available to most customers in most major markets worldwide continues to attract new customers with our planned annual product release cycle and new enhancements such as web support direct from autodesk and elearning we expect maintenance revenues to continue to increase as a percentage of total net revenues 

  

net revenues in the americas increased 9 to 4096 million in fiscal 2004 as compared to 3742 million in fiscal 2003 despite the difficult selling environment experienced during most of the first half of fiscal 2004 the overall increase is primarily due to strong upgrade and subscription revenue during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2004 

  

net revenues in the europe middle east and africa “emea” region increased 28 to 3372 million in fiscal 2004 from 2634 million in fiscal 2003 due primarily to strong upgrade and subscription sales and favorable exchange rates ignoring the effects of changes in foreign currencies during the year net revenues for emea increased approximately 10 as compared to fiscal 2003 

  

net revenues in asia pacific increased 9 to 2048 million in fiscal 2004 from 1873 million in fiscal 2003 the increase in net revenues was due primarily to strong upgrade and subscription sales offset in part by the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome “sars” especially in the greater china region during the second quarter of fiscal 2004 ignoring the effects of changes in foreign currencies during the year net revenues for asia pacific increased approximately 4 as compared to fiscal 2003 

  

for fiscal 2004 net revenues for the design solutions segment were 8117 million as compared to 6944 million in fiscal 2003 aggregate net revenues from sales of autocad and autocad lt products increased to 4322 million in fiscal 2004 from 3570 million in fiscal 2003 the increase in net revenues in fiscal 2004 for both the design solutions segment and combined autocad and autocad lt products was due primarily to strong upgrade and subscription sales coupled with favorable exchange rates revenue from new seat licenses accounted for 50 of design solutions segment fiscal 2004 revenues as compared to 65 for fiscal 2003 and upgrade revenue accounted for 27 of fiscal 2004 as compared to 15 for fiscal 2003 maintenance revenue accounted for 14 of total design solutions segment revenue for fiscal 2004 as compared to 11 in fiscal 2003 although we have been shifting our focus to more verticallyoriented product lines sales of autocad autocad upgrades and autocad lt continue to comprise a significant portion of our net revenues such sales which are reflected in the net revenues for the platform technology division and other accounted for 45 and 43 of our consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2004 and 2003 respectively a critical component of our growth strategy is to convert our 2d customer base including customers of autocad autocad lt and related vertical industry products to our 3d products such as autodesk inventor series or autodesk revit however should sales of autocad autocad upgrades and autocad lt products decrease without a corresponding conversion of the customer seats to 3d products our results of operations will be adversely affected 

  

net revenues for the discreet segment increased to 1396 million in fiscal 2004 from 1285 million in fiscal 2003 this increase was due primarily to demand for new versions of our advanced systems products during early fiscal 2004 increased demand related to the release of a new generation of workstations by silicon graphics inc “sgi” late in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 and increased revenue from the most recent version of our 3ds max product released at the end of the third fiscal 

  

quarter of fiscal 2004 our discreet advanced system products are generally sold as integrated solutions on workstations from sgi net revenues from our advanced systems products were 919 million during fiscal 2004 as compared to 801 million in fiscal 2003 

  

the weaker value of the us dollar relative to international currencies had a positive impact on net revenues in fiscal 2004 had exchange rates from the prior year been in effect in fiscal 2004 translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been 578 million lower changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant impact on net revenues in future periods to minimize this impact we utilize foreign currency option collar contracts to reduce the current period exchange rate impact on the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions 

  

international sales accounted for approximately 63 of our net revenues in fiscal 2004 as compared to 61 in the prior fiscal year we believe that international sales will continue to comprise a significant portion of net revenues economic weakness in any of the countries which contribute a significant portion of our net revenues would have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

fiscal 2003 net revenues compared to fiscal 2002 net revenues 

  

our net revenues for fiscal 2003 were 8249 million as compared to 9475 million in fiscal 2002 net revenues decreased in all three geographic areas the overall decrease was due to two primary factors 

  

first we faced a difficult customer purchasing environment across the industries we serve particularly manufacturing commercial construction and media and entertainment our customers both delayed purchases and purchased in smaller quantities than we would normally expect we believe our customers were impacted by economic pressures in their own businesses 

  

second our revenues were impacted by a relatively slow year for new product releases across many of our divisions leading to weakness in sales of both new commercial seats as well as sales of upgrades in previous years when new product cycles occurred such as for autocad our flagship product revenues from customers upgrading and new commercial seat licenses resulted in significant revenue growth between years during fiscal 2003 upgrade revenues for our autocadbased software products decreased to 690 million from 2297 million in the previous year which is a decline much greater than the decrease in total net revenues between years 

  

while the customer subscription program met our internal growth goals during fiscal 2003 subscription revenues were not yet large enough to offset the relatively weak upgrade sales this was due to the ratable revenue recognition model that we use for subscription bookings and the lack of availability of the subscription program in several regions outside of the united states 

  

net revenues in the americas decreased to 3742 million in fiscal 2003 from 4337 million in fiscal 2002 due primarily to lower sales of design solutions products as a result of poor economic conditions in the industries that constitute our customer base net revenues in europe middle east and africa decreased to 2634 million in fiscal 2003 from 2908 million in 2002 due to the impact of lower customer spending across product lines net revenues in asia pacific decreased to 1873 million in fiscal 2003 from 2230 million in fiscal 2002 due primarily to weakness in the japanese economy 

  

in the design solutions segment net revenues from sales of combined autocad and autocad lt products decreased to 3570 million in fiscal 2003 from 4398 million in fiscal 2002 due primarily to a weak spending environment across the industries we serve and reduced purchasing of then current product releases in anticipation of new product releases that started in march 2003 such sales accounted for 43 of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2003 and 46 of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2002 

  

net revenues for the discreet segment were 1285 million in fiscal 2003 as compared to 1561 million in fiscal 2002 as advanced system sales were significantly affected by the timing of new product releases and delays in customer purchases as those customers were severely impacted by the economic slow down in the media advertising and entertainment sectors discreet advanced system sales are dependent upon capital spending from post production companies demand from post production companies is largely dependent upon television advertising spending television advertising spending was weak during fiscal 2003 and 2002 

  

the weaker value of the us dollar relative to international currencies had a positive impact on net revenues in fiscal 2003 had exchange rates from the prior year been in effect in fiscal 2003 translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been 141 million lower 

  

international sales accounted for approximately 61 of our net revenues in fiscal 2003 as compared to 66 in the prior fiscal year 

  

costs and expenses 

  

autodesk previously classified information technology and other corporate service costs that benefit the entire organization as general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 autodesk reevaluated its cost allocation methodology and reclassified these costs to other functional areas of the business that benefit from these services as a result fiscal 2004 general and administrative expenses have been reduced by 464 million and fiscal 2004 total cost of revenues marketing and sales and research and development have been increased by 51 million 236 million and 177 million respectively this reclassification has no impact on autodesk’s income from operations or net income fiscal 2003 and 2002 balances have been reclassified to conform to the 2004 presentation for a more detailed discussion see note 1 “business and significant accounting policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

cost of revenues 

  

   

cost of license and other revenues includes direct material and overhead charges royalties amortization of purchased technology and capitalized software and the labor cost of processing orders and fulfilling service contracts direct material and overhead charges include the cost of hardware sold mainly workstations manufactured by sgi for the discreet segment costs associated with transferring our software to electronic media printing of user manuals and packaging materials and shipping and handling costs 

  

cost of license and other revenues decreased 2 during fiscal 2004 or 30 million as compared to fiscal 2003 due primarily to reduced royalty expense and changes in product mix cost of license and other revenues in fiscal year 2003 was 136 million lower than fiscal year 2002 due primarily to the mix of product sales and overall lower revenue between years 

  

cost of maintenance revenues includes direct program costs amortization of capitalized software and overhead charges cost of maintenance revenues increased 53 million for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to higher amortization of capitalized software related to underlying support systems and incremental direct program costs incurred as part of the expansion of the subscription program cost of maintenance revenues in fiscal 2003 increased 18 million as compared to fiscal 2002 due primarily to additional amortization of capitalized software related to underlying support systems 

  

in the future cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues is likely to continue to be impacted by the mix of product sales increased consulting and hosted service costs software amortization costs royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products and the geographic distribution of sales 

  

marketing and sales expenses 

  

   

marketing and sales expenses include salaries dealer and sales commissions travel and facility costs for our marketing sales dealer training and support personnel and overhead charges these expenses also include programs aimed at increasing revenues 

  

such as advertising trade shows and expositions as well as various sales and promotional programs designed for specific sales channels and end users 

  

the increase of 355 million between fiscal years 2004 and 2003 was due primarily to increased commission bonus and other incentive compensation expenses of 213 million related to the increased sales volume as well as higher marketing costs related to new product introductions 

  

the decrease of 102 million between fiscal years 2003 and 2002 was due primarily to lower dealer and sales commissions of 46 million due to lower revenue lower rent and occupancy charges of 14 million which resulted from cost saving initiatives and lower professional services of 45 million 

  

we expect to continue to invest in marketing and sales of our products to develop market opportunities and to promote our competitive position accordingly we expect marketing and sales expenses to continue to be significant both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues 

  

research and development expenses 

  

   

research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software engineers contract development fees depreciation of computer equipment used in software development and overhead charges 

  

the increase of 190 million between fiscal years 2004 and 2003 was due to higher bonus accruals based on current financial performance higher costs associated with localizing our products for different markets worldwide and incremental development costs resulting from our acquisitions of linius technologies and via development corporation during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 

  

the increase of 52 million between fiscal years 2003 and 2002 was primarily due to incremental costs resulting from our acquisitions of revit technology corporation in april 2002 and caice software corporation in september 2002 and our continued funding of location based services and product lifecycle management initiatives research and development expenses for fiscal year 2003 were offset by 36 million of capitalized development costs mostly associated with autocad 2004 which was released in march 2003 

  

we expect that research and development spending will continue to be significant in fiscal 2005 as we continue to invest in product development 

  

general and administrative expenses 

  

   

general and administrative expenses include our finance human resources legal costs and overhead charges 

  

the increase of 109 million between fiscal years 2004 and 2003 was due primarily to higher bonus accruals based on current financial performance offset in part by the reversal of the spatial legal accrual established in fiscal 2003 

  

the decrease of 40 million between fiscal years 2003 and 2002 was due primarily to lower rent and occupancy charges of 17 million which resulted from cost saving initiatives and a 49 million decrease in bad debt expense as a result of improved 

  

collection of trade receivables these decreases were primarily offset by 35 million of additional legal accruals of which 25 million was specifically set aside for spatial legal proceedings matter 

  

given we do not plan to complete our restructuring activities until the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and we plan to incur incremental costs related to our assessment of internal controls as required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 for fiscal 2005 we currently expect that general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenues will remain in the range of 9 to 10 of revenue for fiscal 2005 

  

goodwill amortization expense 

  

on february 1 2002 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” therefore autodesk no longer amortizes goodwill but rather tests it for impairment annually in the fourth quarter there was no impairment of goodwill during the year ended january 31 2004 or 2003 goodwill amortization expense was 199 million in fiscal 2002 

  

other intangible amortization expense 

  

amortization of purchased intangibles is provided on a straightline basis over the respective useful lives of the assets which range from three to seven years amortization expense was 05 million in fiscal 2004 03 million in fiscal 2003 and 10 million in fiscal 2002 

  

restructuring and other charges 

  

   

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 the board of directors approved a restructuring plan that involves the elimination of between 550 and 650 positions and the closure of a number of offices worldwide this plan is designed to further reduce operating expense levels to enable us to achieve our targeted operating margins as well as redirect resources to product development sales development and other critical areas the restructuring charge under this plan is estimated to be up to 370 million incurred over the four quarters beginning the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 of the 370 million 260 million is attributable to onetime termination benefits and 110 million is attributable to office closure costs as a result of this restructuring plan we expect to realize pretax savings of 125 million per quarter upon completion of the plan resulting in an annual savings of 500 million to be reflected in each ongoing cost and expense line item in the consolidated statements of income a portion of these annual savings will be reinvested in other parts of the business resulting in the creation of new positions in these reinvested areas 

  

during fiscal 2004 autodesk recognized net 32 million of restructuring and other charges resulting solely from restructuring activities the net charge of 32 million is comprised of 38 million related to the fiscal 2004 restructuring plan recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 as well as 11 million related to additional office closure costs under the fiscal 2002 restructuring plan since the office closures in fiscal 2002 there has been a significant downturn in the commercial real estate market particularly in areas of the united kingdom where some of the offices are located as such autodesk is unable to either buyout the remaining lease obligations at favorable amounts or sublease the space at amounts originally estimated during fiscal 2002 these charges were offset by 17 million of credits resulting from restructuring accrual reversals related to underlying liabilities originally established under the fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2003 restructuring plans the underlying liabilities primarily related to employee termination costs outside the united states were ultimately settled for less than originally estimated 

  

of the 38 million related to the fiscal 2004 plan 02 million related to office closure costs and 36 million related to the termination of 71 employees in the united states and 15 employees outside the united states office closure costs included losses on operating leases and the writeoff of leasehold improvements and equipment employee termination costs consisted of onetime termination benefits including severance benefits medical benefits and outplacement costs 

  

during fiscal 2003 autodesk recognized 259 million of restructuring and other charges of the 259 million 107 million related to additional costs associated with the fiscal 2002 restructuring plan and 183 million related to a fiscal 2003 restructuring plan offset by a credit of 21 million recorded as a result of accrual reversals and a credit of 10 million recorded related to the 

  

reversal of the remaining restructuring charges related to our fiscal 2000 restructuring program of the 107 million 12 million related to the further consolidation of certain european offices and the remaining 95 million resulted from changes to estimated accrued liabilities related to vacated facilities 

  

during the third quarter of fiscal 2003 the board of directors approved a restructuring plan that resulted in the termination of 394 employees and the closure of several additional international and domestic offices as a result of this restructuring plan we realized immediate pretax savings of 100 million per quarter and increased cash flows of 100 per quarter in addition to the savings realized from the fiscal 2002 plan both the pretax and cash flow savings were reinvested in other parts of the business during the year ended january 31 2003 autodesk recognized 183 million of expenses as part of this restructuring effort of which 165 million related to employee termination costs and 18 million related to office closures employee termination costs consisted of wage continuation advance notice pay medical benefits and outplacement costs for 184 employees in the united states and 210 employees outside the united states office closure costs included losses on operating leases and the writeoff of leasehold improvements and equipment during fiscal year 2003 we also reversed 21 million of accruals related to restructuring reserves established in fiscal 2002 the facilityrelated accruals were settled for less than originally estimated 

  

during fiscal 2002 autodesk recognized 336 million of restructuring and other charges these charges resulted from restructuring activities 245 million inprocess research and development expenses related to the acquisition of the software division of media 100 32 million—see note 10 “business combinations” the winddown costs associated with the dissolution of redspark 36 million—see note 5 “gain on disposal of affiliate” and a goodwill writeoff of 23 million the writeoff of goodwill primarily related to an acquired infrastructure solutions division business and resulted from a strategic decision to abandon the underlying product line 

  

the restructuring costs which were part of a formal exit plan approved by our board of directors during the second quarter of fiscal 2002 were in connection with our effort to reduce operating expense levels during that same quarter we reduced our revenue estimates for the remainder of fiscal 2002 as a result of the restructuring we realized immediate pretax savings of 60 million per quarter and increased cash flows of 40 million per quarter these pretax savings have been reflected in each ongoing cost and expense line in the consolidated statements of income both the pretax and cash flow savings were reinvested in other parts of the business 

  

for additional information regarding the restructuring and other charges recorded over the past three fiscal years see note 11 “restructuring and other” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

interest and other income 

  

the following table sets forth the components of interest and other income net in millions 

  

   

interest and investment income increased 10 million during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to 42 million of interest income related to a one time tax benefit realized during the second quarter of fiscal 2004 resulting from the favorable resolution with the irs of an industrywide issue regarding foreign sales corporations partially offset by continued declining interest rates on the investment of cash and marketable securities balances 

  

investment income decreased between fiscal 2003 and 2002 primarily due to a trend of declining interest rates on the investment of cash and marketable securities balances investment income fluctuates based on average cash and marketable securities balances average maturities and interest rates 

  

gain on disposal of affiliate 

  

during the third quarter of fiscal 2002 we recognized a onetime noncash gain of 95 million related to the dissolution of redspark because we owned greater than 50 of the voting stock we had been consolidating redspark’s operating losses since redspark was formed in april 2000 redspark’s expenses which were primarily research and development related were included within the operating expense categories of our consolidated statements of income the gain which resulted from the 

  

reversal of the minority interest liability balance represents the reversal of cumulative losses recognized in excess of the 32 million we originally invested 

  

provision for income taxes 

  

absent the impact of the nonrecurring tax benefits from the resolution of a foreign sales corporation “fsc” issue and the internal revenue service “irs” audit resolution for fiscal 2000 described below our effective income tax rate was 24 in fiscal 2004 27 in fiscal 2003 absent the impact of the nonrecurring tax benefit from the irs audit resolution for fiscal 19971999 and 30 in fiscal 2002 absent the impact of the gain on disposal of an affiliate the effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 is less than the federal statutory rate of 35 due to the extraterritorial income exclusion “eti” research credits and taxexempt interest the fiscal 2004 tax rate was lower than the fiscal 2003 and 2002 tax rates due to a relatively higher impact of these items offset by benefits associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate in the prior years 

  

our future effective tax rate may be materially impacted by the amount of benefits associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate eti research credits taxexempt interest and changes in the tax law we currently believe that our fiscal 2005 effective tax rate will approximate 24 subject to any material changes related to our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate eti research credits taxexempt interest and changes in the tax law 

  

at january 31 2004 we had net deferred tax assets of 176 million realization of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate approximately 460 million of future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions we believe that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize these assets 

  

during fiscal 2004 we recognized an income tax benefit of 197 million due to a favorable resolution of an industrywide matter surrounding our fsc for the fiscal years ended 1993 through 1998 in connection with the refund of these tax payments previously made the company received payment and recognized interest income of 42 million during fiscal 2004 

  

also during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we recognized a nonrecurring income tax benefit of 70 million resulting from the resolution of an irs audit for the fiscal year ended 2000 

  

equity in net loss of affiliate 

  

in august 2001 we acquired the remaining 60 interest in buzzsaw inc that we did not own consequently from the date of the acquisition buzzsaw’s ongoing revenues and costs and expenses have been included in each of the respective line items in our consolidated statements of income in fiscal 2002 prior to the acquisition we recognized equity in net losses of 12 million representing our proportionate share of buzzsaw’s losses during that period 

  

business combinations 

  

over the past three years we acquired new technology or supplemented our technology by purchasing businesses focused in specific markets or industries during this time period we acquired the following businesses 

  

   

   

for additional information on each of the acquired businesses described above see note 10 “business combinations” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

at january 31 2004 our principal sources of liquidity were cash and marketable securities totaling 5295 million and net accounts receivable of 1668 million cash flows from operating activities together with the proceeds from stock issuances resulting from our employee stock plans continue to be our principal means of generating cash cash flows from operating activities have historically resulted from sales of our software products and changes in working capital accounts 

  

during fiscal 2004 we generated 2201 million of cash from operating activities as compared to 856 million in fiscal 2003 working capital uses of cash included increases in accounts receivable and inventories and a decrease in other accrued liabilities accounts receivable increased over january 2003 levels primarily due to higher revenue our days sales outstanding improved to 51 days at january 31 2004 as compared to 62 days at january 31 2003 overall our inventory levels were higher by 41 at the end of fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to higher levels of hardware for our newer discreet segment products the decrease in other accrued liabilities was primarily due to the utilization of restructuring accruals during fiscal 2004 working capital sources of cash included increases in accrued compensation largely due to higher accruals for bonus and commission expenses based on fiscal 2004 financial performance and deferred revenue due to higher subscription program revenues 

  

during fiscal 2004 we used 590 million in net cash for investing activities compared to 650 million during fiscal 2003 the increase in cash generated from operating activities compared to fiscal 2003 resulted in net purchases of availableforsale investments in fiscal 2004 capital expenditures decreased to 259 million in fiscal 2004 as compared to 361 million in fiscal 2003 due in part to cost saving measures current capital expenditures reflect our continuing investment in our it infrastructure in addition we acquired two businesses for an aggregate 52 million 

  

we used 765 million in net cash for financing activities in fiscal 2004 compared to 39 million during fiscal 2003 the major financing use of cash in both years was for the repurchase of shares between november 1999 and december 2003 the board of directors approved plans to repurchase up to 600 million shares of our common stock the purpose of the stock repurchase program is among other things to help offset the dilution to earnings per share caused by the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans during fiscal 2004 we repurchased 91 million shares for 1785 million and during fiscal 2003 we repurchased 44 million shares for 648 million at january 31 2004 approximately 171 million shares remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization we expect to continue our stock repurchase programs to offset the impact of our employee equity programs the other financing use of cash for both years was for the payment of dividends dividend payments were 134 million in fiscal 2004 and 136 million in fiscal 2003 the principal source of cash from financing activities was 1154 million in fiscal 2004 and 747 million in fiscal 2003 of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and stock purchase plans 

  

during fiscal 2004 we had a us line of credit available that permitted unsecured shortterm borrowings of up to 400 million this credit facility expired in february 2004 we do not plan to renew this facility as we believe our existing cash cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated shortterm and longterm cash requirements longterm cash requirements other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the development of new software products and incremental product offerings resulting from the enhancement of existing products financing anticipated growth dividend payments the share repurchase program the acquisition of businesses software products or technologies complementary to our business and capital expenditures including the purchase of customer relationship management software and services 

  

at january 31 2004 approximately 54 of our consolidated cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held with financial institutions in the united states the remaining balances are held with financial institutions outside the united states for tax consequences of the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries see note 4 “income taxes” in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations to minimize the impact of these fluctuations we use foreign currency option contracts to hedge our exposure on anticipated transactions and forward contracts to hedge our exposure on firm commitments primarily certain receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies our foreign currency instruments by policy have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period the principal currencies hedged during fiscal 2004 were the euro swiss francs canadian dollars british pounds and japanese yen we monitor our foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions 

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at january 31 2004 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at january 31 2004 

  

   

   

for the purposes of this table contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on autodesk and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies services and other goods and services are not included in the table above we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies services or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our 

  

expected requirements for three months we also enter into contracts for outsourced services however in most instances the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty in addition we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products royalty expense is generally based on the number of units shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue royalty expense included in cost of license and other revenues was 86 million 76 million and 108 million in fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

principal commitments at january 31 2004 consisted of obligations under operating leases for facilities and computer equipment it infrastructure costs marketing costs contractual development costs and certain capital expenditures related to the purchase and implementation of customer relationship management software and services 

  

the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

  

we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees including limited product warranties historically costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant and because potential future costs are highly variable we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

other than operating leases we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing arrangements or have any variableinterest entities as of january 31 2004 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

  

stock compensation 

  

we maintain three active stock option plans for the purpose of granting stock options to employees and members of autodesk’s board of directors the 1996 stock plan available to employees but not directors the nonstatutory stock option plan available only to nonexecutive employees and the 2000 directors’ option plan available only to outside directors additionally there are five expired plans with options outstanding our 1996 stock plan expires during calendar 2006 

  

our stock option program is a broadbased longterm retention program essentially all of our employees participate approximately 88 of the options we granted during fiscal 2004 were awarded to employees other than our ceo and four of the most highly compensated executive officers options granted under the abovementioned plans vest over periods ranging from one to five years and expire within ten years the exercise price of the stock options is equal to the fair market value of the stock on the grant date 

  

with the exception of grants to our outside directors all stock option grants to executive officers and guidelines for grants to other employees are made by the compensation and human resources committee of the board of directors all members of the compensation committee are independent directors as defined in the application rules for issuers traded on the nasdaq national market see the “report of the compensation and human resources committee of the board of directors on executive compensation” appearing in autodesk’s proxy statement dated may 20 2003 for further information concerning autodesk’s policies and procedures regarding the use of stock options grants to our outside directors are nondiscretionary and are predetermined by the terms of the 2000 directors’ option plan 

  

additional information regarding stock compensation is incorporated by reference to the section of the proxy statement entitled “employee and director stock options” 

  

risk factors which may impact future operating results 

  

we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks many of which are beyond our control the following discussion highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on future results of operations if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted causing the trading price of our common stock to decline 

  

because we derive a substantial portion of our net revenues from a limited number of products if these products are not successful our net revenues will be adversely affected 

  

we derive a substantial portion of our net revenues from sales of autocad software including products based on autocad that serve specific vertical markets upgrades to those products and products that are interoperable with autocad as such any factor adversely affecting sales of these products including product release cycle market acceptance product 

  

performance and reliability reputation price competition and the availability of thirdparty applications would likely harm our operating results 

  

in the discreet business our customers’ buying patterns are heavily influenced by advertising and entertainment industry cycles which have resulted in and may continue to have a negative impact on our operating results in addition discreet’s advanced systems products rely on workstations manufactured by silicon graphics inc “sgi” failure of sgi to deliver products or product upgrades in a timely manner would likely result in an adverse effect upon our financial results for a given period 

  

our operating results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenues and operating results difficult to predict 

  

our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include among other things the timing of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors slowing of momentum in upgrade or maintenance revenue failure to achieve anticipated levels of customer acceptance of key new applications unexpected costs or changes in marketing or other operating expenses changes in product pricing or product mix platform changes delays in product releases distribution channel management changes in sales compensation practices the timing of large systems sales and general economic or political conditions particularly in countries where we derive a significant portion of our net revenues 

  

we have also experienced fluctuations in operating results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic conditions in particular our operating results in europe during the third quarter are usually impacted by a slow summer period and the asia pacific operations typically experience seasonal slowing in the third and fourth quarters operating expenses may also increase in periods when major product releases occur 

  

additionally our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term accordingly any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability further gross margins may be adversely affected if our sales of autocad lt upgrades and systems products which historically have had lower margins grow at a faster rate than sales of our highermargin products 

  

general economic conditions may affect our net revenues and harm our business 

  

as our business has grown we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic and political conditions if economic growth in the united states and other countries’ economies is slowed many customers may delay or reduce technology purchases this could result in reductions in sales of our products longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition in addition weakness in the enduser market could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could in turn delay paying their obligations to us which would increase our credit risk exposure any of these events would likely harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

existing and increased competition may reduce our net revenues and profits 

  

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of desktop computers with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the markets in which we compete are fairly mature and characterized by vigorous competition both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies in addition some of our competitors have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources furthermore a reduction in the number and availability of comparable thirdparty applications may adversely affect the sale of our products because of these and other factors competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future increased competition could result in continued price reductions reduced net revenues and profit margins and loss of market share any of which would likely harm our business 

  

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer products that compete favorably with respect to reliability performance ease of use range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation and price 

  

we rely on third party technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies our product and service development may be delayed 

  

we rely on certain software that we license from third parties including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions an example of this type of software is the acis geometric solid modeler we license from spatial corp these thirdparty software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and the software may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software could be developed identified licensed and integrated which would likely harm our business 

  

in addition for certain of our products and services we rely on third party hardware and services like the workstations supplied by sgi financial difficulties or even failure of these third parties like sgi may impact our ability to deliver such products and services and as a result may adversely impact our business 

  

disruptions with licensing relationships independent developers and third party developers could adversely impact our business 

  

independent firms and contractors perform some of our product development activities while other technologies are licensed from third parties licenses may restrict use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business we generally either own or license the software developed by third parties 

  

because talented development personnel are in high demand independent developers including those who currently develop products for us may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future similarly we may not be able to obtain and renew license agreements on favorable terms if at all and any failure to do so could harm our business 

  

our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with thirdparty developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn in particular markets this disruption would likely negatively impact these thirdparty developers and end users which could harm our business 

  

net revenues or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline which could harm our business 

  

the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including the following net revenues or earnings shortfalls and changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors quarterly variations in our or our competitors’ results of operations developments in our industry onetime events such as acquisitions and litigation and general market conditions and other factors including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 

  

in addition stock prices for many companies in the technology sector have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies historically after extended periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities a company becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management’s attention and resources 

  

our efforts to develop and introduce new products and service offerings expose us to risks such as limited customer acceptance costs related to product defects and large expenditures that may not result in additional net revenues 

  

rapid technological change as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences characterize the software industry we are devoting significant resources to the development of technologies like our linux based applications in the discreet segment and service offerings to address demands in the marketplace for increased connectivity and use of digital data created by computeraided design software as a result we are transitioning to new business models requiring a considerable investment of technical and financial resources such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs or competitors may introduce new products and services that will achieve acceptance among our current customers adversely affecting our competitive position in particular a critical component of our growth strategy is to convert our 2d customer base including customers of autocad autocad lt and related vertical industry products to our 3d products such as autodesk inventor series or autodesk revit however should sales of autocad autocad upgrades and autocad lt products 

  

decrease without a corresponding conversion of the customer seats to 3d products our results of operations will be adversely affected 

  

additionally the software products we offer are complex and despite extensive testing and quality control may contain errors or defects these defects or errors could result in corrective releases to our software products damage to our reputation loss of revenues an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products any of which would likely harm our business 

  

our business could suffer as a result of risks associated with strategic acquisitions divestures and investments 

  

we periodically acquire or invest in businesses software products and technologies that are complementary to our business through strategic alliances equity investments and the like for example in february 2003 we acquired assets of linius technologies inc in march 2003 we acquired certain assets of via development corporation and in march 2004 we entered into an agreement to purchase certain assets of mechsoftcom inc subject to standard closing contingencies the risks associated with such acquisitions or investments include among others the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the companies the failure to realize anticipated synergies and the diversion of management’s time and attention in addition such investments and acquisitions as well as business divestures may involve significant transactionrelated costs we may not be successful in overcoming such risks and such investments acquisitions and divestures may negatively impact our business in addition such investments and acquisitions have in the past and may in the future contribute to potential fluctuations in quarterly results of operations the fluctuations could arise from mergerrelated costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or writeoffs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions these costs or charges could negatively impact results of operations for a given period or cause quarter to quarter variability in our operating results 

  

our international operations expose us to significant regulatory intellectual property collections exchange fluctuations and other risks which could adversely impact our future net revenues and increase our net expenses 

  

we anticipate that international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues and will provide significant support to our overall development efforts risks inherent in our international operations include the following unexpected changes in regulatory practices and tariffs difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales and development operations longer collection cycles for accounts receivable potential changes in tax laws and laws regarding the management of data greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property and the impact of fluctuating exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business 

  

our international results will also continue to be impacted by general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets or in specific large foreign markets in particular the potential economic impact from the failure of expected continued growth in asia pacific particularly china in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 could disrupt trade and market relationships in a way that could harm our business these and other factors may adversely impact our future international operations and consequently our business as a whole 

  

our risk management strategy uses derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward and option contracts for the purpose of hedging foreign currency market exposures in the current quarter which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations nevertheless significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currency markets may adversely impact our future net revenues 

  

if we do not maintain our relationship with the members of our distribution channel or achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough our ability to generate net revenues will be adversely affected 

  

we sell our software products both directly to customers and through a network of distributors and resellers our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our reseller network computer software dealers and distributors are typically not highly capitalized and have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and may do so in the future while we have processes to ensure that we assess the creditworthiness of dealers and distributors prior to our sales to them if their financial condition were to deteriorate they might not be able to make repeat purchases in addition the changing distribution models resulting from increased focus on direct sales to strategic accounts or from twotiered distribution may impact our reseller network in the future no single customer distributor or reseller accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net revenues in during fiscal 2004 2003 or 2002 we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions the loss of or a significant reduction in business with those distributors or resellers or the failure to achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough with any one of our major international distributors or large resellers could harm our business in particular if one or more of such resellers should be unable to meet their 

  

obligations with respect to accounts payable to us we could be forced to write off such accounts which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period 

  

product returns could exceed our estimates and harm our net revenues 

  

with the exception of contracts with some distributors our sales contracts do not contain specific productreturn privileges however we permit our distributors and resellers to return products in certain instances for example we generally allow our distributors and resellers to return older versions of products which have been superceded by new product releases we anticipate that product returns will continue to be impacted by product update cycles new product releases such as autocad 2004 and software quality 

  

we establish reserves for stock balancing and product rotation these reserves are based on historical experience estimated channel inventory levels and the timing of new product introductions and other factors while we maintain strict measures to monitor these reserves actual product returns may differ from our reserve estimates and such differences could harm our business 

  

if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights our business could be harmed 

  

we rely on a combination of patents copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software products or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our software products is timeconsuming and costly while we have recovered some revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists and software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem furthermore our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop similar technology 

  

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 

  

as more and more software patents are granted worldwide and as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows and as the functionality of products in different industry segments overlap we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims infringement invalid claims or misappropriation claims may be asserted against us and any such assertions could harm our business litigation often becomes more likely in times of economic downturn additionally certain patent holders have become more aggressive in threatening litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents any such claims or threats whether with or without merit could be timeconsuming to defend result in costly litigation and diversion of resources cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in addition such royalty or license agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms if at all which would likely harm our business 

  

if we are required to expense options granted under our employee stock plans as compensation our net income and earnings per share would be significantly reduced and we may be forced to change our business practices to attract and retain employees 

  

historically we have used stock options as a key component of our employee compensation packages we believe that stock options provide an incentive to our employees to maximize longterm stockholder value and through the use of vesting encourage valued employees to remain with us certain proposals related to accounting for the grant of an employee stock option as an expense have been issued for comment by the financial accounting standards board if such proposals are implemented our net income and earnings per share will be negatively impacted as a result we may decide to reduce the number of employees who receive stock options or grant fewer options to particular employees this could adversely affect our ability to retain existing employees and attract qualified candidates and also could increase the cash compensation we would have to pay to them 

  

our planned restructuring for fiscal year 2005 could result in disruptions to our business or to our employee base which could negatively impact anticipated revenues during those periods 

  

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we announced a planned restructuring which included workforce reduction and closure of certain facilities we expect related restructuring charges to be charged through the third quarter of fiscal 2005 if we fail to effect all of the planned headcount and facilities reductions our results of operations for those periods may be negatively impacted 

  

or may result in unanticipated fluctuations in quarterly results of operations additionally disruptions to our employee base may adversely impact anticipated revenues during those periods

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend   

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

our revenues earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage our foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations contracts are primarily denominated in euro swiss franc canadian dollar british pounds and japanese yen we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

  

a sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january 31 2004 indicated that a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 31 2004 would increase the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by 61 million conversely a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the dollar from its value at january 31 2004 would decrease the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by 41 million these results are consistent with the sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january 31 2003 which indicated that a hypothetical 10 appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 31 2003 would have increased the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by 66 million and a hypothetical 10 depreciation of the dollar from its value at january 31 2003 would have decreased the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by 44 million we do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows as a result of these foreign currency forward and option contracts 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities including those classified as security deposits of 2473 million at january 31 2004 and 2247 million at january 31 2003 these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations and will decrease in market value if interest rates increase 

  

a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of january 31 2004 this sensitivity analysis is based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus 50 plus 100 or plus 150 basis points occurring in either six months or 12 months for the sixmonth time horizon the market value changes for a 50 100 or 150 basis point increase were reductions of 16 million 31 million and 46 million respectively for the 12month time horizon the market value changes for a 50 100 or 150 basis point increase were reductions of 13 million 27 million and 40 million respectively 

  

the same sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of january 31 2003 for the sixmonth time horizon the market value changes for a 50 100 or 150 basis point increase were reductions of 17 million 33 million and 49 million respectively for the 12month time horizon the market value changes for a 50 100 or 150 basis point increase were reductions of 14 million 28 million and 41 million respectively 

  

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy guidelines which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue issuer or type of instrument 

  

investments in privatelyheld businesses 

  

we have an investment portfolio that includes minority equity investments in several privatelyheld technology companies many of which are in the development stage we account for these minority equity investments using the cost method of accounting because our ownership interests are less than 20 and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence on the investees at january 31 2004 the remaining net book value of these investments was reduced to zero write downs of our investments in privatelyheld businesses totaled 06 million in fiscal 2004 34 million in fiscal 2003 and 29 million in fiscal 2002

product development and introduction 

  

we continue to enhance our product offerings and develop new products to meet changing customer demands research and development expenditures amounted to 21 of fiscal 2003 revenues the majority of our basic research and product development is performed in the us while translation and localization of foreignmarket versions as well as some product development is performed by development teams or contractors in our local markets we generally translate and localize our products into french italian german spanish japanese and various chinese dialects various aspects of our productrelated functions including software development localization quality assurance and technical publications are performed in canada europe and asia 

  

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware operating systems and software as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences to keep pace with these 

  

 changes we maintain an aggressive program of new product development to address demands in the marketplace for increased connectivity and use of digital data created by our products we dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to further enhance our existing products and to create new products and technologies these investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs or our competitors may introduce new products and services that achieve acceptance among our current customers either of which would likely adversely affect our competitive position 

  

our software products are complex and despite extensive testing and quality control may contain errors or defects these defects or errors could result in corrective releases to our software products damage to our reputation loss of revenues an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products any of which would likely harm our business 

  

we actively recruit and hire experienced software developers and license and acquire complementary software technologies and businesses in addition we actively collaborate with and support independent software developers who offer products that enhance and complement our products 

  

independent firms and contractors perform some of our product development activities while other technologies are licensed from third parties licenses may restrict use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business we generally either own or license the software developed by third parties because talented development personnel are in high demand independent developers including those who currently develop products for us may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future similarly we may not be able to obtain and renew existing license agreements on favorable terms if at all and any failure to do so would likely harm our business 

  

our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with thirdparty developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our software some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn in particular markets this disruption could negatively impact these thirdparty developers and end users which could harm our business 

  

marketing and sales 

  

we sell our products and services both directly to customers which include large corporations and through established distributors and resellers our customerrelated operations are divided into three geographic regions the americas europe and asiapacific and are supported by global marketing and sales organizations these organizations develop and manage overall marketing and sales programs and work closely with a network of domestic and foreign offices 

  

we also work directly with reseller and distributor sales organizations computer manufacturers other software developers and peripheral manufacturers in cooperative advertising promotions and tradeshow presentations we employ massmarketing techniques such as web casts seminars telemarketing direct mailings and advertising in business and trade journals we have a worldwide user group organization dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products 

  

our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our reseller network computer software dealers and distributors are typically not highly capitalized and have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction such as current worldwide economic conditions and may do so in the future in addition the changing distribution models resulting from the internet from increased focus on direct sales to major accounts or from twotiered distribution may impact our reseller network in the future while no single customer distributor or reseller accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated net revenues in any of the past three fiscal years the loss of or a significant reduction in business or failure to achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough with any one of our major international distributors or large resellers could harm our business 

  

   

we intend to continue to make our products available in foreign languages we believe that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues we are in a time of significant political unrest and economic troubles continued economic weakness in any of the countries which contribute a significant portion of our net revenues would likely have a material adverse effect on our business a summary of our financial information by geographic location is found in note 13 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

customer and reseller support 

  

through our autodesk professional services division for design solutions products and through discreet for its products we provide technical support and training to customers through a leveraged model augmented by programs designed to address specific direct needs we expect that end users rely primarily on their resellers and distributors for technical support we support the resellers and distributors through technical product training sales training classes the internet and direct telephone support support content is also available on the product support portion of our internet site there are also a number of user group forums in which customers are able to share information 

  

while we expect the resellers and distributors to provide the majority of technical support to our customers we have developed programs to deliver direct support to some customers 

  

developer programs 

  

one of our key strategies is to maintain an openarchitecture design of our software products to facilitate thirdparty development of complementary products and industryspecific software solutions this approach enables customers and third parties to customize our products for a wide variety of highly specific uses we offer several programs that provide marketing sales technical support and programming tools to developers who develop addon applications for our products 

  

backlog 

  

we typically ship products shortly after receipt of an order which is common in the computer software industry accordingly we do not maintain a significant backlog moreover the backlog as of any particular date gives no indication of actual sales for any succeeding period 

  

competition 

  

we compete with a variety of companies in different aspects of our business 

  

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of desktop computers with continually expanding performance capacity at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the markets in which we compete are fairly mature and characterized by vigorous competition both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies in addition the availability of thirdparty application software is a competitive factor within the cad market because of these and other factors competitive conditions in these industries are likely to continue to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenues and profit margins and loss of market share any of which could harm our business furthermore some of our competitors have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources 

  

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer new products and to continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to reliability performance ease of use range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation price and training 

  

   

intellectual property and licenses 

  

we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions nonetheless our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business 

  

from time to time we receive claims alleging infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights including patents litigation often becomes more likely in times of economic downturn disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to among other things costly litigation or product shipment delays which could harm our business 

  

we retain ownership of software we develop all software is licensed to users and provided in object code pursuant to either shrinkwrap embedded or online licenses or executed license agreements these agreements contain restrictions on duplication disclosure and transfer 

  

we believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our intellectual property and the rapid ongoing technological changes in both the computer hardware and software industries we must rely principally upon software engineering and marketing skills to maintain and enhance our competitive market position 

  

while we have recovered some revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists we believe however that software piracy is and can be expected to be a persistent problem 

  

production and suppliers 

  

production of our design solutions segment software products involves duplication of the software media and the printing of user manuals the purchase of media and the transfer of the software programs onto media for distribution to customers are performed by us and by licensed subcontractors media for our products include cdroms and diskettes which are available from multiple sources user manuals for our products and packaging materials are produced to our specifications by outside sources production is generally performed in leased facilities operated by us some product assembly is also performed by independent thirdparty contractors to date we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the production of our software and documentation 

  

in addition the discreet segment has historically relied on thirdparty vendors for the supply of hardware components used in its systems many of the discreet’s software products currently run on workstations manufactured by silicon graphics inc “sgi” there are significant risks associated with this reliance on sgi and discreet may be impacted by unforeseen difficulties associated with adapting their products to future sgi products and the timing of the development and release of sgi products 

  

employees 

  

as of january 31 2003 we had 3498 fulltime equivalent employees none of our employees in the us are represented by a labor union however in certain foreign countries our employees are represented by worker councils we have never experienced any work stoppages 

  

our continued growth and future success is highly dependent on the ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees 

  

   










 item 2 properties 

  

our executive offices and the principal offices for domestic marketing and sales and production are located in leased office space in northern california we also lease space in various locations throughout the us for local sales development and technical support personnel our foreign subsidiaries lease office space for their operations including local sales product development and technical support personnel during fiscal 2003 we closed several domestic and international offices in an effort to reduce operating expense levels 

  

we believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet our requirements for the foreseeable future 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

on december 27 2001 spatial corp “spatial” filed suit in marin county superior court against autodesk and dcubed ltd “dcubed” seeking 1 a declaration that a autodesk had breached the ten year old development agreement between spatial and autodesk “development agreement” and b that autodesk and dcubed had misappropriated the trade secrets of spatial 2 an injunction preventing autodesk from disclosing acis source code to dcubed and 3 an injunction preventing autodesk from working with individuals who had previously worked on acis source code for spatial acis is a geometric solid modeler upon which autodesk shapemanager is derived autodesk shapemanager is incorporated into a number of autodesk products including autodesk inventor series autocad based products and 3ds max 

  

after a hearing on january 23 2002 the superior court denied spatial’s motion for a preliminary injunction finding that spatial had failed to establish that it was likely to prevail on the merits at trial on august 1 2002 spatial amended its complaint to seek the following additional remedies 1 a declaration regarding the appropriate location of the acis source code and 2 termination of development agreement including our right to work with third party contractors on the acis source code and the perpetual right to incorporate and distribute acis with our products on october 16 2002 spatial dismissed all of its claims for misappropriation of trade secrets against autodesk and dcubed on february 13 2003 the court granted dcubed ltd’s motion for summary judgment and denied our motion for summary adjudication of issues we filed a motion for reconsideration of the court’s ruling to be argued in may 2003 the case is now scheduled for trial in june 2003 

  

we believe that spatial’s claims are without merit and we are contesting them vigorously although the results of litigation are inherently uncertain we believe that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have material effect on our consolidated statements of financial condition results of operations or cash flows however if spatial were to prevail at trial on its request to terminate the perpetual license to acis and we could not obtain a license on acceptable terms or license or develop a substitute technology our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 we recorded a 25 million reserve related to this matter 

  

on october 7 2002 digimation inc filed a demand for arbitration against autodesk with the american arbitration association alleging breach of contract and interference with prospective economic advantage and business relations the claims arise out of a november 1998 preferred publisher agreement the “ppa” entered into with our discreet division and relate to the marketing publishing development and support of software plugins for our 3ds max application we have counterclaimed against digimation for among other things digimation’s failure to perform under the ppa we believe that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material effect on our consolidated statements of financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

generally we are involved in various legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities in our opinion resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or our financial position however depending on the amount and timing an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect our future results of operations cash flows or financial position in a particular period

stockholders 

  

as of january 31 2003 the number of common stockholders of record was 857 because many of our shares of common stock are held by brokers or other institutions on behalf of stockholders we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by the record holders 

  

   




 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

the discussion in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” contains trend analyses and other forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 forwardlooking statements consist of among other things statements regarding net revenues revenue mix level of product returns gross margins costs and expenses legal contingencies and restructuring activity as well as statements involving trend analyses and statements including such words as “we believe” and similar expressions these forwardlooking statements are subject to business and economic risks as such our actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements as a result of the factors set forth elsewhere herein including “risk factors which may impact future operating results” 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities net revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity accordingly these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 

  

revenue recognition our accounting policies and practices are in compliance with statement of position 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended and staff accounting bulletin no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” 

  

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable however determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 

  

based on whether the sale is product or service related we recognize revenue as follows product sales are recognized at the time of shipment as long as all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met subscription customer support and hosted service revenues are recognized ratably over the contract periods customer consulting and training revenues are recognized as the services are performed 

  

allowance for bad debts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments at january 31 2003 we had a bad debt reserve of 92 million 

  

estimated reserves are determined based upon historical loss patterns the number of days that billings are past due and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with specific problem accounts while we believe our existing reserve for doubtful accounts is adequate and proper additional reserves may be required should the financial condition of our customers deteriorate or as unusual circumstances arise 

  

product return reserves with the exception of contracts with certain distributors our sales contracts do not contain specific productreturn privileges however we permit our distributors and resellers to return product in certain instances generally when new product releases supercede older versions at january 31 2003 we had a product returns reserve of 198 million 

  

   

in the past three years product returns as a percentage of applicable revenues have been in the range of 4 to 7 annually during fiscal year 2003 product returns as a percentage of applicable revenue was 6 the product return reserves are based on estimated channel inventory levels the timing of new product introductions and other factors the greater the channel inventory level or the closer the proximity of a major new product release such as autocad 2004 the more product returns we expect during fiscal year 2003 we recorded a reserve for product returns of 333 million which reduced our gross sales 

  

while we believe our accounting practice for establishing and monitoring product returns reserves is adequate and proper any adverse activity or unusual circumstances could result in an increase in reserve levels in the period in which such determinations are made 

  

realizability of longlived assets we review the realizability of our longlived assets and related intangible assets annually during the fourth fiscal quarter or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable we consider some of the following factors important in deciding when to perform an impairment review significant underperformance of a business or product line relative to budget shifts in business strategies which impact the continued uses of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends and the results of past impairment reviews 

  

in assessing the recoverability of these longlived assets we first determine their fair values which are based on assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows that could reasonably be generated by these assets when assessing longlived assets we use undiscounted cash flow models impairment charges if any result in situations when the fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values 

  

in addition to our recoverability assessments we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our longlived assets any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made as well as in subsequent quarters this situation occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 resulting in additional amortization expense of 03 million 

  

we will continue to evaluate the values of our longlived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

  

goodwill on february 1 2002 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” therefore we no longer amortize goodwill we test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

  

deferred tax assets we currently have 272 million of net deferred tax assets mostly arising from net operating losses tax credits reserves and timing differences for purchased technologies and capitalized software offset by the establishment of us deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries we perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets which is principally dependent upon our achievement of future taxable income of approximately 700 million in specific geographies our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors these changes if any may require possible material adjustments to these net deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determinations are made 

  

restructuring expenses associated with office closures during the year ended january 31 2003 we recorded restructuring charges of 259 million of which 125 million related to the closure of several domestic and international offices these office closure costs were based upon the projected rental payments through the remaining terms of the underlying operating leases offset by projected subleasing income the projected 

  

 subleasing income amounts were calculated by using information provided by thirdparty real estate brokers and management judgments and were based on assumptions for each of the real estate markets where the leased offices were located should real estate markets worsen and we are not able to sublease the properties as expected we will record additional expenses in the period when such determinations are made this situation occurred during fiscal 2002 and 2003 and we therefore recorded additional charges as a result of the inability to sublease abandoned offices if the real estate markets subsequently improve and we are able to sublease the properties earlier or at more favorable rates than projected we will reverse some of the underlying restructuring accruals which will result in increased net income in the period when such determinations are made 

  

legal contingencies  as described in item 3 legal proceedings and note 7 commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability for the estimated loss during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 we recorded a 25 million reserve related to the spatial matter because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters we base our loss reserves on the best information available at the time as additional information becomes available we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly results of operations 

  

stock option accounting  we do not record compensation expense when stock option grants are awarded to employees at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of autodesk common stock on the date of grant 

  

had we recorded compensation expense our net income would have been substantially less the impact of expensing employee stock awards is further described in note 1 in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

recently issued accounting standards 

  

during november 2002 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others an interpretation of fasb statements no 5 57 and 107 and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 34” “fin 45” fin 45 elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued it also clarifies that at the time a guarantee is issued the guarantor must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its financial statements the initial recognition and measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 and the disclosure requirements apply to guarantees outstanding as of december 31 2002 we adopted the provisions of fin 45 effective january 31 2003 some of the software licenses we grant contain provisions that indemnify licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging that our software infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party we have historically received only a limited number of requests for indemnification under these provisions and have not been required to make material payments pursuant to these provisions accordingly we have not recorded a liability related to these indemnification provisions 

  

overview of fiscal 2003 results of operations 

in thousands 

  

   

   

our fiscal 2003 net revenues were down 13 percent from the prior fiscal year this revenue decline resulted in an operating margin of 3 percent of fiscal 2003 net revenues as compared to 10 percent in fiscal 2002 and 15 percent in fiscal 2001 the decline in revenue this year was due to two primary factors 

  

first we faced a difficult customer purchasing environment across the industries we serve particularly manufacturing commercial construction and media and entertainment our customers both delayed purchases and purchased in smaller quantities than we would normally expect we believe our customers were impacted by economic pressures in their own businesses 

  

second our revenues were impacted by a relatively slow year for new product releases across many of our divisions leading to weakness in sales of both new commercial seats as well as sales of upgrades in previous years when new product cycles occurred such as for autocad our flagship product revenues from customers upgrading and new commercial seat licenses resulted in significant revenue growth between years during fiscal 2003 upgrade revenues for our software products decreased to 856 million from 2584 million in the previous year which is a decline much greater than the decrease in total net revenues between years our most significant new product releases occurred either late in fiscal 2003 or are scheduled for release early in fiscal 2004 

  

during fiscal 2002 we introduced in the us the autodesk subscription program which is an option for our customers who own the most recent version of the underlying product through this program which is available for a majority of our design solutions products as well as discreet’s 3ds max we offer customers strong value while allowing us to reduce our dependence on revenues from customers upgrading when new product cycles occur while the customer subscription program met our internal growth goals during fiscal 2003 subscription revenues were not yet large enough to offset the relatively weak upgrade sales this was due to the ratable revenue recognition model that we use for subscription bookings and the lack of availability of the subscription program in several regions outside of the us 

  

each of our sales geographies suffered due to the two factors described above we generate a significant amount of revenue in several countries including the us japan germany united kingdom italy france canada and china japan was particularly weak in our asia pacific region due largely to continued weakness in the japanese economy 

  

our operating margins are very sensitive to reductions in sales revenues given the relatively fixed nature of most of our operating expenses which consist primarily of employeerelated expenditures facilities costs and depreciation and amortization expense during fiscal 2003 we invested in several new internal product initiatives which we believe will contribute to future operating margin growth these investments were in areas such as product lifecycle management building lifecycle management location based services online collaborative services and desktop video 

  

we have chosen to continue each of these important investments during our current sales slowdown because we believe each of them is very promising and we believe our ability to fund such investments during an economic slowdown is a strong competitive advantage by continuing to fund these initiatives we have explicitly chosen not to reduce our costs to a level that would achieve historical operating margin levels 

  

during fiscal 2003 we acquired three new businesses revit technology corporation caice software corporation and trueinnovations inc these investments either provide us with future opportunities in markets where we have a limited presence or supplement existing technology for a more detailed discussion see note 10 business combinations in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

during fiscal 2003 we continued our cost reduction efforts primarily in areas such as employee and facilities related costs the objective of this restructuring activity and other cost saving initiatives such as no incentive bonus payouts and mandatory time off for our employees was to provide a level of profitability and provide funding during fiscal 2003 for the investments described above we believe that our recent activities will 

  

 result in an annual operating expense run rate between 6500 million to 6600 million exclusive of any additional restructuring or unusual charges at this operating expense level we expect to continue to remain profitable at recent levels of revenue and be able to fund investments we believe will increase future revenues and operating margins 

  

throughout fiscal 2003 we maintained a financially strong balance sheet and we generated 862 million of cash from our operating activities we finished the year with 4110 million in cash and marketable securities and a significantly higher deferred revenue balance as compared to the previous year over 60 percent of the deferred revenues balance at january 31 2003 consisted of customer subscription contracts which as described previously will be recognized as revenue ratably over the life of the contracts 

  

results of operations 

  

net revenues 

  

   

our net revenues for fiscal 2003 were 8249 million as compared to 9475 million in fiscal 2002 net revenues decreased in all three geographic areas as previously described the overall decrease was primarily due to a difficult selling environment across the industries we serve and by a slow year for new product releases with most of our competitors suffering similar slowdowns we do not believe we have lost market share to competitors the timing of our product cycles typically impact the amount of sales in periods when new releases occur should the difficult economic environment continue our net revenues in fiscal 2004 will be adversely affected 

  

net revenues in the americas decreased to 3742 million in fiscal 2003 from 4337 million in fiscal 2002 due primarily to lower sales of design solutions products as a result of poor economic conditions in the industries that constitute our customer base net revenues in europe decreased to 2634 million in fiscal 2003 from 2908 million in 2002 due to the impact of lower customer spending across product lines net revenues in asia pacific decreased to 1873 million in fiscal 2003 from 2230 million in fiscal 2002 due primarily to weakness in the japanese economy 

  

   

net revenues for the discreet segment were 1285 million in fiscal 2003 as compared to 1561 million in fiscal 2002 as advanced system sales were significantly affected by the timing of new product releases and delays in customer purchases as those customers were severely impacted by the economic slow down in the media advertising and entertainment sectors discreet advanced system sales are dependent upon capital spending from post production companies demand from post production companies is largely dependent upon television advertising spending television advertising spending has been weak over the past two years 

  

in the design solutions segment net revenues from sales of combined autocad and autocad lt products decreased to 3570 million in fiscal 2003 from 4398 million in fiscal 2002 due primarily to a weak spending environment across the industries we serve and reduced revenues in anticipation of new product releases although we have been reducing our dependence on key product lines sales of autocad autocad upgrades and autocad lt continue to be a significant portion of our net revenues such sales which are reflected in the net revenues for the platform technology division and other accounted for 43 percent of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2003 and 46 percent of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2002 should sales of autocad autocad upgrades and autocad lt products decrease as a result of weakened demand due to poor economic conditions in the industries that constitute our customer base our results of operations will be adversely affected 

  

the weaker value of the us dollar relative to international currencies had a positive impact on net revenues in fiscal 2003 had exchange rates from the prior year been in effect in fiscal 2003 translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been 141 million lower changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant impact on net revenues in fiscal 2004 

  

international sales accounted for approximately 61 percent of our net revenues in fiscal 2003 as compared to 66 percent in the prior fiscal year we believe that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total revenues many world economies are in the midst of current economic slowdowns economic weakness in any of the countries which contribute a significant portion of our net revenues would have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our net revenues for fiscal 2002 were 9475 million as compared to 9363 million in fiscal 2001 increased net revenues in asia pacific and the americas were partially offset by lower sales in europe 

  

net revenues for the discreet segment were 1561 million in fiscal 2002 as compared to 1932 million in the prior fiscal year as advanced system sales were significantly affected by a slowdown in the media advertising and entertainment sectors upon which product sales depend 

  

net revenues for the design solutions segment were 7914 million in fiscal 2002 as compared to 7431 million in the prior fiscal year the overall increase in segment revenues was attributable to a stronger portfolio of product offerings such as autodesk inventor autodesk architectural desktop autodesk map autodesk land desktop and autocad 2002 and increased customer demand for greater productivity tools sales of autocad autocad upgrades and autocad lt accounted for 46 percent of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2002 and 47 percent of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2001 

  

the stronger value of the us dollar relative to international currencies had a negative impact on net revenues in fiscal 2002 had exchange rates from the prior year been in effect in fiscal 2002 translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been 232 million higher 

  

international sales accounted for approximately 66 percent of our net revenues in fiscal 2002 as compared to 60 percent in the prior fiscal year we believe that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total revenues 

  

   

cost of revenues 

  

   

cost of revenues includes direct material and overhead charges royalties amortization of purchased technology and capitalized software and the labor cost of processing orders and fulfilling service contracts direct material and overhead charges include the cost of hardware sold mainly workstations manufactured by sgi for the discreet segment costs associated with transferring our software to electronic media printing of user manuals and packaging materials and shipping and handling costs 

  

the decrease of 110 million between fiscal years 2003 and 2002 was due primarily to the mix of product sales and overall lower revenue between years 

  

the cost of revenues in fiscal year 2002 was the same as a percentage of net revenues and similar in absolute dollars to cost of revenues in fiscal year 2001 

  

in the future cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues is likely to continue to be impacted by the mix of product sales increased consulting and hosted service costs software amortization costs royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products and the geographic distribution of sales however we expect future cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues to remain within our historical range of 16 to 20 percent 

  

marketing and sales expenses 

  

   

marketing and sales expenses include salaries dealer and sales commissions and travel and facility costs for our marketing sales dealer training and support personnel these expenses also include programs aimed at increasing revenues such as advertising trade shows and expositions as well as various sales and promotional programs designed for specific sales channels and end users 

  

the decrease of 118 million between fiscal years 2003 and 2002 was due primarily to lower dealer and sales commissions of 46 million due to lower revenue lower rent and occupancy charges of 14 million which resulted from cost saving initiatives and lower professional services of 45 million 

  

the increase of 257 million between fiscal years 2002 and 2001 was primarily due to higher employeerelated expenses resulting from an increasing focus on direct sales to major accounts 

  

we expect to continue to invest in marketing and sales of our products to develop market opportunities and to promote our competitive position accordingly we expect marketing and sales expenses to continue to be significant both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues 

  

   

research and development expenses 

  

   

research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software engineers contract development fees and depreciation of computer equipment used in software development the increase of 44 million between fiscal years 2003 and 2002 was primarily due to incremental costs resulting from our recent acquisitions of revit in april 2002 and caice in september 2002 and our continued funding of location based services and product lifecycle management initiatives research and development expenses for fiscal year 2003 were offset by 36 million of capitalized development costs mostly associated with autocad 2004 which was released in march 2003 

  

research and development expenses in fiscal year 2002 were the same as a percentage of net revenues and similar in absolute dollars to research and development expenses in fiscal year 2001 

  

we expect that research and development spending will continue to be significant in fiscal 2004 as we continue to invest in product development 

  

general and administrative expenses 

  

   

general and administrative expenses include our information systems finance human resources legal and other administrative operations we generally do not allocate these costs to the business divisions they support so such expenses impact general and administrative rather than cost of revenues research and development or marketing and sales expenses the decrease of 26 million between fiscal years 2003 and 2002 was due primarily to lower rent and occupancy charges of 17 million which resulted from cost saving initiatives and a 49 million decrease in bad debt expense as a result of improved collection of trade receivables these decreases were primarily offset by 35 million of additional legal settlement reserves of which 25 million was specifically set aside for the spatial legal proceedings matter 

  

general and administrative expenses in fiscal year 2002 were the same as a percentage and similar in absolute dollars to general and administrative expenses in fiscal year 2001 

  

we currently expect that in the coming year general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues will remain generally consistent with the level experienced in fiscal 2003 

  

other intangible assets amortization of purchased intangibles is provided on a straightline basis over the respective useful lives of the assets which range from three to seven years amortization expense was 03 million in fiscal 2003 10 million in fiscal 2002 and 22 million in fiscal 2001 

  

goodwill amortization expense on february 1 2002 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” therefore autodesk no longer amortizes goodwill 

  

 but rather tests it for impairment annually in the fourth quarter there was no impairment of goodwill during the year ended january 31 2003 goodwill amortization expense was 199 million in fiscal 2002 and 243 million in fiscal 2001 

  

restructuring and other charges 

  

   

during fiscal 2003 autodesk recognized 259 million of restructuring and other charges resulting solely from restructuring activities of the 259 million 107 million related to additional costs associated with the fiscal 2002 restructuring plan and 182 million related to a new fiscal 2003 restructuring plan partially offset by a credit of 30 million resulting from accrual reversals of the 107 million related to the fiscal 2002 plan 12 million related to the further consolidation of certain european offices and the remaining 95 million resulted from increases to estimated accrued liabilities related to vacated facilities since these offices were closed in fiscal 2002 there has been a significant downturn in the real estate market particularly in northern california where some of the offices are located as such we were unable to either buyout the remaining lease obligations at favorable amounts or sublease the space at amounts originally estimated during fiscal 2002 

  

during the third quarter of fiscal 2003 the board of directors approved a new restructuring plan that resulted in the termination of 394 employees and the closure of several additional international and domestic offices as a result of the restructuring plan approved in the third quarter of 2003 we expect to realize immediate pretax savings of 100 million per quarter and increased cash flows of 100 million per quarter these savings are expected to last for the next several quarters and the pretax savings will be reflected in each ongoing cost and expense line item in the consolidated statements of income both the pretax and cash flow savings are being used to fund the new business opportunities previously described during the year ended january 31 2003 we recognized 182 million of expenses as part of this restructuring effort of which 165 million related to employee termination costs and 17 million related to office closures employee termination costs consisted of wage continuation advance notice pay medical benefits and outplacement costs for 184 employees in the us and 210 employees outside the us office closure costs included losses on operating leases and the writeoff of leasehold improvements and equipment during fiscal year 2003 we also reversed 20 million and 10 million of facility related accruals related to restructuring reserves established in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2000 respectively the facilityrelated accruals were settled for less than originally estimated 

  

during fiscal 2002 we recognized 336 million of restructuring and other charges these charges resulted from restructuring activities 245 million inprocess research and development expenses related to the acquisition of media 100 32 million the winddown costs associated with the dissolution of redspark a development stage company 36 million and a goodwill writeoff of 23 million the writeoff of goodwill primarily related to an acquired infrastructure solutions division business and resulted from a strategic decision to abandon the underlying product line 

  

the restructuring costs which were part of a formal exit plan approved by our board of directors during the second quarter of fiscal 2002 were in connection with our effort to reduce operating expense levels during that same quarter we reduced our revenue estimates for the remainder of fiscal 2002 as a result of the restructuring we realized immediate pretax savings of 60 million per quarter and increased cash flows of 40 million per quarter in addition to the savings expected to be realized from the 2003 restructuring plan these savings are expected to last for the next several quarters and the pretax savings have been reflected in each ongoing cost and expense line item in the consolidated statements of income both the pretax and cash flow savings were reinvested in other parts of the business 

  

   

during fiscal 2001 we reversed 12 million of accruals 10 million of which related to a restructuring reserve established in fiscal 2000 the accruals were settled for less than originally estimated 

  

for additional information regarding the restructuring and other charges recorded over the past three fiscal years see note 11 restructuring and other in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

interest and other income 

  

the following table sets forth the components of interest and other income net in thousands 

  

   

investment income fluctuates based on average cash and marketable securities balances average maturities and interest rates the decrease in interest and other income between fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 was primarily due to a trend of declining interest rates on the investment of cash and marketable securities balances combined with lower cash and marketable securities balances 

  

gain on disposal of affiliate during the third quarter of fiscal 2002 we recognized a onetime noncash gain of 95 million related to the dissolution of redspark because we owned greater than 50 percent of the voting stock we had been consolidating redspark’s operating losses since redspark was formed in april 2000 redspark’s expenses which were primarily research and development related were included within the operating expense categories of our statement of income the gain which resulted from the reversal of the minority interest liability balance represents the reversal of cumulative losses recognized in excess of the 32 million we originally invested 

  

provision for income taxes absent the impact of the nonrecurring tax benefit resulting from the internal revenue service “irs” audit resolution for fiscal 19971999 our effective income tax rate was 27 percent in fiscal 2003 30 percent in fiscal 2002 absent the impact of the gain on disposal of affiliate and 32 percent in fiscal 2001 the nonrecurring net tax benefit of 38 million resulted from the resolution of our irs audit for the fiscal years ended 19971999 and the establishment of us deferred income taxes on previously permanently reinvested foreign earnings the effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 is less than the federal statutory rate of 35 percent due to the benefits associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate research credits and taxexempt interest partially offset by additional taxes provided on prior year foreign earnings additional taxes on prior year foreign earnings relate to a foreign tax audit and to intercompany transfer pricing adjustments the fiscal 2003 tax rate was lower than the fiscal 2002 and 2001 tax rates due to a relatively higher impact of these permanent items 

  

our future effective tax rate may be impacted by the amount of benefits associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate research credits and taxexempt interest we currently believe that our fiscal 2004 effective tax rate will be less than 27 percent primarily due to a relatively higher impact of benefits associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate 

  

at january 31 2003 we had net deferred tax assets of 272 million realization of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate approximately 700 million of future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions we believe that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize these assets 

  

   

equity in net loss of affiliate in august 2001 we acquired the remaining 60 percent interest in buzzsaw that we did not own consequently from the date of the acquisition buzzsaw’s ongoing revenues and costs and expenses have been included in each of the respective line items in our consolidated statements of income 

  

we recognized equity in net losses of 12 million in fiscal 2002 and 163 million in fiscal 2001 representing our proportionate share of buzzsaw’s losses during those periods in april 2000 we invested 175 million in buzzsaw and maintained a 40 percent interest loss recognition was suspended during the first quarter of 2002 after we fully expensed all previous investments in buzzsaw 

  

business combinations 

  

over the past three years we acquired new technology or supplemented our technology by purchasing businesses focused in specific markets or industries during this time period we acquired the following businesses 

  

   

these acquisitions were all accounted for under the purchase method of accounting pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 141 “business combinations” 

  

of these acquisitions 32 million of the media 100 purchase price was allocated to inprocess research and development “iprd” and was expensed immediately since the technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and no alternative future uses could be identified 

  

as of the acquisition date the iprd substantially consisted of the hitman product an enterprise encoding system that automates the encoding process and allows for the encoding of multiple jobs at the same time the hitman product was 75 percent complete at the time with 04 million of estimated remaining costs to reach technological feasibility we recently released this product with actual costs to complete that approximated the initial 04 million estimate 

  

   

in valuing the developed and inprocess technologies we used a discounted cash flow analysis based on projected net revenues cost of revenues operating expenses and income taxes resulting from such technologies over a 6year period the projected financial results which were discounted using a 40 percent rate for the developed technology and a 50 percent rate for the iprd were based on expectations of media 100 on a standalone basis 

  

the revenue projections for developed technologies which considered the release dates of new products assumed a gradual decline we based the revenue projections for the iprd on expected trends in technology and the timing of new product introductions 

  

for a more detailed discussion of the allocation of the total purchase considerations for each of the acquired businesses described above which includes among other things liabilities assumed see note 10 business combinations in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

at january 31 2003 our principal sources of liquidity were cash and marketable securities totaling 4110 million and accounts receivable of 1328 million additionally we currently have a 400 million line of credit with a financial institution  other than operating leases described below we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing arrangements or any special purpose entities 

  

during fiscal 2003 we generated 862 million of cash from operating activities as compared to 2102 million in fiscal 2002  cash flows from operating activities together with the proceeds from stock issuances resulting from our employee stock plans continue to be our principal means of generating cash cash flows from operating activities have historically resulted from sales of our software products changes in working capital accounts and addbacks of noncash expense items such as depreciation and amortization 

  

during fiscal 2003 the cash generated together with cash and securities available at the start of the year was used to fund the repurchase of 44 million shares of our common stock for 648 million the acquisition of revit for 1330 million the acquisition of two other businesses for 122 million capital and other expenditures of 361 million and dividend payments totaling 136 million 

  

between november 1999 and march 2001 the board of directors approved plans to repurchase up to 440 million shares of our common stock of these 440 million shares 339 million have been repurchased and retired as of january 31 2003 the purpose of the stock repurchase program is among other things to help offset the dilution to earnings per share caused by the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans 

  

as of february 2003 we have a us line of credit permitting shortterm unsecured borrowings of up to 400 million which may be used from time to time for working capital or other business needs this credit facility contains restrictive covenants that among other provisions require autodesk to maintain certain financial ratios and expires in february 2004 

  

we generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments principal commitments at january 31 2003 consisted of obligations under operating leases for facilities and some computer equipment at january 31 2003 the future minimum lease payments under these lease commitments were as follows in millions of these amounts 102 million has been included in our restructuring accruals at january 31 2003 

  

   

   

we believe our existing cash cash equivalents marketable securities available line of credit and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated shortterm and longterm cash requirements longterm cash requirements other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the development of new software products and incremental product offerings resulting from the enhancement of existing products financing anticipated growth dividend payments the share repurchase program the acquisition of businesses software products or technologies complementary to our business and capital expenditures in february 2003 we acquired the assets of linius technologies inc for 10 million in cash and in march 2003 we acquired certain assets of via development corporation for approximately 42 million in cash capital expenditures for fiscal 2004 are currently anticipated to approximate what was incurred during fiscal 2003 but could be reduced if our revenues are less than anticipated 

  

our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations to minimize the impact of these fluctuations we use foreign currency option contracts to hedge our exposure on anticipated transactions and forward contracts to hedge our exposure on firm commitments primarily certain payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies our foreign currency instruments by policy have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period the principal currencies hedged during fiscal 2003 were the euro swiss franc british pound canadian dollar and japanese yen we monitor our foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions 

  

stock compensation 

  

we maintain three active stock option plans for the purpose of granting stock options to employees and members of autodesk’s board of directors the 1996 stock plan available to employees but not directors the nonstatutory stock option plan available only to nonexecutive employees and the 2000 directors’ option plan available only to outside directors additionally there are five expired plans with options outstanding 

  

our stock option program is a broadbased longterm retention program essentially all of our employees participate approximately 91 percent of the options we granted during fiscal 2003 were awarded to employees other than our ceo and four most highly compensated executive officers options granted under the above mentioned plans vest over periods ranging from one to five years and expire within ten years the exercise price of the stock options is equal to the fair market value of the stock on the grant date 

  

with the exception of grants to our outside directors all stock option grants to executive officers and guidelines for grants to other employees are made by the compensation committee of the board of directors all members of the compensation committee are independent directors as defined in the application rules for issuers traded on the nasdaq stock market see the “report of the compensation committee on executive compensation” appearing in autodesk’s proxy statement dated may 20 2002 for further information concerning the policies and procedures of autodesk and the compensation committee regarding the use of stock options grants to our outside directors are predetermined by the terms of the 2000 directors’ option plan 

  

additional information regarding stock compensation is incorporated by reference to the section of the proxy statement entitled “employee and director stock options” 

  

   

risk factors which may impact future operating results 

  

we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks many of which are beyond our control the following discussion highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on future results of operations if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted causing the trading price of our common stock to decline 

  

general economic conditions may continue to reduce our net revenues and harm our business 

  

as our business has grown we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic and political conditions including the conflict in the persian gulf and the potential economic impact from current concerns about severe acute respiratory syndrome “sars” because of the continued slowdown in the us and other countries’ economies many customers are delaying or reducing technology purchases if this slowdown continues particularly in industries or countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenues it will likely continue to result in reductions in sales of our products longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition in addition weakness in the enduser market could continue to negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could in turn delay paying their obligations to us which would increase our credit risk exposure any of these events would likely harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

because we derive a substantial portion of our net revenues from a limited number of products if these products are not successful our net revenues will be adversely affected 

  

we derive a substantial portion of our net revenues from sales of autocad software including products based on autocad that serve specific vertical markets upgrades to those products and products that are interoperable with autocad as such any factor adversely affecting sales of these products including product life cycle market acceptance product performance and reliability reputation price competition and the availability of thirdparty applications would likely harm our operating results 

  

in the discreet business our customers’ buying patterns are heavily influenced by advertising and entertainment industry cycles which has resulted in and may continue to have a negative impact on our operating results in addition discreet’s systems products rely on workstations manufactured by silicon graphics and failure of silicon graphics to deliver products in a timely manner would likely result in an adverse effect upon our financial results for a given period 

  

our operating results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenues and operating results difficult to predict 

  

our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include the timing of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors changes in marketing or operating expenses changes in product pricing or product mix platform changes delays in product releases distribution channel management changes in sales compensation practices the timing of large systems sales and general economic or political conditions particularly in countries where we derive a significant portion of our net revenues 

  

we have also experienced fluctuations in operating results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic conditions in particular our operating results in europe during the third quarter are usually impacted by a slow summer period and the asia pacific operations typically experience seasonal slowing in the third and fourth quarters operating expenses may also increase in periods when major product releases occur 

  

   

additionally our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term accordingly any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability further gross margins may be adversely affected if our sales of autocad lt upgrades and systems products which historically have had lower margins grow at a faster rate than sales of our highermargin products 

  

existing and increased competition may reduce our net revenues and profits 

  

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of desktop computers with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the markets in which we compete are fairly mature and characterized by vigorous competition both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies in addition some of our competitors have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources furthermore a reduction in the number and availability of comparable thirdparty applications may adversely affect the sale of our products because of these and other factors competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future increased competition could result in continued price reductions reduced net revenues and profit margins and loss of market share any of which would likely harm our business 

  

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer products that compete favorably with respect to reliability performance ease of use range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation and price 

  

we rely on third party technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies our product and service development may be delayed 

  

we rely on certain software that we license from third parties including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions an example of this type of software is the acis geometric solid modeler we license from spatial these thirdparty software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and the software may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software could be developed identified licensed and integrated which would likely harm our business 

  

in addition for certain of our products and services we rely on third party hardware and services financial difficulties or even failure of these third parties may impact our ability to deliver such online collaboration applications and as a result may adversely impact our business 

  

disruptions with licensing relationships independent developers and third party developers could adversely impact our business 

  

independent firms and contractors perform some of our product development activities while other technologies are licensed from third parties licenses may restrict use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business we generally either own or license the software developed by third parties 

  

because talented development personnel are in high demand independent developers including those who currently develop products for us may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future similarly we may not be able to obtain and renew license agreements on favorable terms if at all and any failure to do so could harm our business 

  

our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with thirdparty developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure 

  

 during periods of economic downturn in particular markets this disruption would likely negatively impact these thirdparty developers and end users which could harm our business 

  

net revenues or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline which could harm our business 

  

the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including the following net revenues or earnings shortfalls and changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors quarterly variations in our or our competitors’ results of operations developments in our industry and general market conditions and other factors including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 

  

in addition stock prices for many companies in the technology sector have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies historically after extended periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities a company becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management’s attention and resources 

  

our efforts to develop and introduce new products and service offerings expose us to risks such as limited customer acceptance costs related to product defects and large expenditures that may not result in additional net revenues 

  

rapid technological change as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences characterize the software industry we are devoting significant resources to the development of technologies and service offerings to address demands in the marketplace for increased connectivity and use of digital data created by computeraided design software as a result we are transitioning to new business models requiring a considerable investment of technical and financial resources such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs or competitors may introduce new products and services that will achieve acceptance among our current customers adversely affecting our competitive position 

  

additionally the software products we offer are complex and despite extensive testing and quality control may contain errors or defects these defects or errors could result in corrective releases to our software products damage to our reputation loss of revenues an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products any of which would likely harm our business 

  

our business could suffer as a result of risks associated with strategic acquisitions and investments 

  

we periodically acquire or invest in businesses software products and technologies that are complementary to our business through strategic alliances equity investments and the like for example in april 2002 we acquired revit and in september 2002 we acquired caice the risks associated with such acquisitions or investments include among others the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the companies the failure to realize anticipated synergies and the diversion of management’s time and attention in addition such investments and acquisitions may involve significant transactionrelated costs we may not be successful in overcoming such risks and such investments and acquisitions may negatively impact our business in addition such investments and acquisitions have in the past and may in the future contribute to potential fluctuations in quarterly results of operations the fluctuations could arise from mergerrelated costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or writeoffs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions these costs or charges could negatively impact results of operations for a given period or cause lack of a consistent increase quarter to quarter in our operating results 

  

   

our international operations expose us to significant regulatory intellectual property collections exchange fluctuations and other risks which could adversely impact our future net revenues 

  

we anticipate that international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues risks inherent in our international operations include the following unexpected changes in regulatory practices and tariffs difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations longer collection cycles for accounts receivable potential changes in tax laws and laws regarding the management of data greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property and the impact of fluctuating exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business 

  

our international results may also continue to be impacted by general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets or in specific large foreign markets in particular war in the persian gulf or the potential economic impact from concerns about sars could disrupt trade and market relationships in a way that could harm our business these and other factors may adversely impact our future international operations and consequently our business as a whole 

  

our risk management strategy uses derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward and option contracts for the purpose of hedging foreign currency market exposures which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations 

  

if we do not maintain our relationship with the members of our distribution channel our ability to generate net revenues will be adversely affected 

  

we sell our software products both directly to customers and through a network of distributors and resellers our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our reseller network computer software dealers and distributors are typically not highly capitalized and have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction such as current worldwide economic conditions and may do so in the future in addition the changing distribution models resulting from the internet from increased focus on direct sales to major accounts or from twotiered distribution may impact our reseller network in the future no single customer distributor or reseller accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2003 2002 or 2001 however we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions and the loss of or a significant reduction in business or failure to achieve anticipated levels of sellthrough with any one of our major international distributors or large resellers could harm our business in particular if one or more of such resellers should be unable to meet their obligations with respect to accounts payable to us we could be forced to write off such accounts which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period 

  

product returns could exceed our estimates and harm our net revenues 

  

with the exception of contracts with some distributors our sales contracts do not contain specific productreturn privileges however we permit our distributors and resellers to return products in certain instances for example we generally allow our distributors and resellers to return older versions of products which have been superceded by new product releases we anticipate that product returns will continue to be impacted by product update cycles new product releases such as autocad 2004 and software quality 

  

we establish reserves for stock balancing and product rotation these reserves are based on historical experience estimated channel inventory levels and the timing of new product introductions and other factors while we maintain strict measures to monitor these reserves actual product returns may differ from our reserve estimates and such differences could harm our business 

  

   

if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights our business could be harmed 

  

we rely on a combination of patents copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software products or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our software products is timeconsuming and costly while we have recovered some revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists and software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem furthermore our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop similar technology 

  

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 

  

we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows and as the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps infringement invalidity claims or misappropriation claims may be asserted against us and any such assertions could harm our business litigation often becomes more likely in times of economic downturn any such claims whether with or without merit could be timeconsuming to defend result in costly litigation and diversion of resources cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in addition such royalty or license agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms if at all which would likely harm our business 

  

the loss of key personnel or the inability to attract and retain additional personnel could harm our business 

  

our continued growth and success depends significantly on the continued service of highly skilled employees and independent developers our ability to attract and retain key personnel is dependent on a number of factors including our continued ability to grant stock incentive awards changes in the accounting rules for stock options which are granted to most of our employees and which have been a significant factor in attracting and retaining key technical and management experts could have a material adverse effect on our business the loss of key personnel or inability to recruit new employees or independent developers would negatively impact our business in addition we may experience increased compensation costs to attract and retain skilled personnel 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage our foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations contracts are primarily denominated in euro swiss francs canadian dollars british pounds and japanese yen we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

  

a sensitivity analysis was performed on our hedging portfolio as of january 31 2003 this analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january 31 2003 would increase the fair value of our forward exchangeoption contracts by 66 million conversely a hypothetical 10 percent depreciation of the dollar from its value at january 31 2003 would decrease the fair value of our forward exchangeoption contracts by 44 million we do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows as a result of these foreign currency forward and option contracts 

  

   

interest rate sensitivity 

  

we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities including those classified as security deposits of 2247 million at january 31 2003 these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations and will decrease in market value if interest rates increase 

  

a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of january 31 2003 this sensitivity analysis is based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus 50 plus 100 or plus 150 basis points occurring in either six months or 12 months for the 6month time horizon the market value changes for a 50 100 or 150 basis point increase were reductions of 17 million 33 million and 49 million respectively for the 12month time horizon the market value changes for a 50 100 or 150 basis point increase were reductions of 14 million 28 million and 41 million respectively 

  

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy guidelines which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue issuer or type of instrument 

  

investments in privatelyheld businesses 

  

we have an investment portfolio with a remaining net book value of approximately 06 million as of january 31 2003 that includes minority equity investments in several privatelyheld technology companies many of which are in the development stage we account for these minority equity investments using the cost method of accounting because our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence on the investees 

  

these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products the portfolio companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never develop into commercially viable products we assess the value of these investments on a regular basis and when we identify other than temporary declines in the values of these investments we write down the carrying values to their fair values write downs totaled 34 million in fiscal 2003 29 million in fiscal 2002 and 26 million in fiscal 2001 due to the inherently risky nature of these investments we may incur additional losses in the future up to the remaining carrying value of 06 million recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at january 31 2003

product development and introduction 

  

the majority of our basic research and product development has been performed in the us while translation and localization of foreignmarket versions as well as some product development are performed by development teams or contractors in our local markets various aspects of our productrelated functions including software development localization quality assurance and technical publications are performed in europe and asia 

  

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware operating systems and software as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences to keep pace with these changes we maintain an aggressive program of new product development to address demands in the marketplace for increased connectivity and use of digital data created by our products we dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to further enhance our existing products and to create new products and technologies these investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs or our competitors may introduce new products and services that will achieve acceptance among our current customers either of which may adversely affect our competitive position 

  

our software products are complex and despite extensive testing and quality control may contain errors or defects these defects or errors could result in corrective releases to our software products damage to our reputation loss of revenues an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products any of which could harm our business 

  

we actively recruit and hire experienced software developers and license and acquire complementary software technologies and businesses in addition we actively collaborate with and support independent software developers who offer products that enhance and complement our products 

  

independent firms and contractors perform some of our product development activities while other technologies are licensed from third parties we generally either own or license the software developed by third parties because talented development personnel are in high demand independent developers including those who currently develop products for us may not be able to provide development support to us in the future similarly we may not be able to obtain and renew existing license agreements on favorable terms if at all and any failure to do so could harm our business 

  

our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with thirdparty developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles in particular markets this disruption could negatively impact these thirdparty developers and end users which could harm our business 

  

marketing and sales 

  

our customerrelated operations are divided into three geographic regions the americas europe and asiapacific and are supported by global marketing and sales organizations these organizations develop and manage overall marketing and sales programs and work closely with a network of domestic and foreign offices we sell our software products both directly to customers which include large corporations and also through distributors and resellers 

  

in addition we work directly with reseller and distributor sales organizations computer manufacturers other software developers and peripheral manufacturers in cooperative advertising promotions and tradeshow presentations we employ massmarketing techniques such as webcasts seminars telemarketing direct mailings and advertising in business and trade journals we have a worldwide user group organization dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products 

  

our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our reseller networks computer software dealers and distributors are typically not highly capitalized and have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and may do so in the future in addition the changing distribution models resulting from the internet from increased focus on direct sales to major accounts or from twotiered distribution may impact our reseller network in the future while no single 

customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated net revenues in any of the past three fiscal years the loss of or a significant reduction in business with any one of our major international distributors or large us resellers could harm our business 

  

we intend to continue to make our products available in foreign languages we believe that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues many world economies are in the midst of current economic slowdowns economic weakness in any of the countries which contribute a significant portion of our net revenues would have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

customer and reseller support 

  

we provide technical support and training to customers through a leveraged model augmented by programs designed to address specific direct needs we expect that end users rely primarily on their resellers and distributors for technical support we support the resellers and distributors through technical product training sales training classes the internet and direct telephone support support content is also available on the product support portion of our internet site there are also a number of user group forums in which customers are able to share information 

  

while we expect the resellers and distributors to provide the majority of technical support to our customers we have developed programs to deliver direct support to some customers 

  

developer programs 

  

one of our key strategies is to maintain an openarchitecture design of our software products to facilitate thirdparty development of complementary products and industryspecific software solutions this approach enables customers and third parties to customize our products for a wide variety of highly specific uses we offer several programs that provide marketing sales technical support and programming tools to developers who develop addon applications for our products 

  

backlog 

  

we typically ship products shortly after receipt of an order which is common in the computer software industry accordingly we do not maintain a significant backlog also the backlog as of any particular date gives no indication of actual sales for any succeeding period 

  

competition 

  

we compete with a variety of companies in different aspects of our business 

  

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of desktop computers with continually expanding capacity at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the design software market in particular is fairly mature and characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies in addition the availability of thirdparty application software is a competitive factor within the cad market because of these and other factors competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenues and profit margins and loss of market share any of which could harm our business furthermore some of our competitors have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources 

  

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer new products and to continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to reliability performance ease of use range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation price and training 

  

intellectual property and licenses 

  

we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions nonetheless our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business 

  

from time to time we receive claims alleging infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights including patents any disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party could lead to among other things costly litigation or cause product shipment delays which could harm our business 

  

we retain ownership of software we develop all software is licensed to users and provided in object code pursuant to either shrinkwrap embedded or online licenses or executed license agreements these agreements contain restrictions on duplication disclosure and transfer 

  

we believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our intellectual property and the rapid ongoing technological changes in both the computer hardware and software industries we must rely principally upon software engineering and marketing skills to maintain and enhance our competitive market position 

  

while we have recovered some revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 

  

production and suppliers 

  

production of our design solutions software products involves duplication of the software media and the printing of user manuals the purchase of media and the transfer of the software programs onto media for distribution to customers are performed by us and by licensed subcontractors media for our products include cdroms and diskettes which are available from multiple sources user manuals for our products and packaging materials are produced to our specifications by outside sources production is generally performed in leased facilities operated by us some product assembly is also performed by independent thirdparty contractors to date we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the production of our software and documentation 

  

the discreet division has historically relied on thirdparty vendors to manufacture and supply all of the hardware components used in its systems manufacturing consists of assembly including disk array assembly testing and value added systems integration many of the discreet division’s software products currently run on workstations manufactured by silicon graphics there are significant risks associated with this reliance on silicon graphics and the discreet division may be impacted by unforeseen difficulties associated with adapting their products to future silicon graphics products and the timing of the development and release of silicon graphics products 

  

employees 

  

as of january 31 2002 we had 3646 fulltime employees our continued growth and future success is highly dependent on the ability to attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees 

  










 item 2 properties 

  

our executive offices and the principal offices for product development domestic marketing and sales and production are located in leased office space in northern california we also lease office space in various locations throughout the us for local sales development and technical support personnel our foreign subsidiaries lease office space for their operations during fiscal 2002 we closed several domestic and international offices in an effort to reduce operating expense levels 

  

we continue to believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet our requirements for the foreseeable future 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we are involved in various legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities in our opinion resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or our financial position however depending on the amount and timing an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect our future results of operations cash flows or financial position in a particular period 

  




 item 4 submission of matters to a vote of security holders

recent acquisitions 

  

in august 2001 we acquired the remaining outstanding stock of buzzsawcom inc “buzzsaw” that we did not own additionally in october 2001 autodesk acquired the software division of media 100 inc “media 100” the acquisition of buzzsaw is part of autodesk’s strategy to extend its business to complementary new markets and the acquisition of media 100 provides autodesk with streaming media technology for among other things the immediate playback of content over the internet both acquisitions were accounted for as purchases accordingly autodesk’s fiscal 2002 consolidated results include buzzsaw’s and media 100’s results of operations from the respective dates of the acquisitions 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets liabilities net revenues costs and expenses and related disclosures we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

we believe that of our significant accounting policies which are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 

  

revenue recognition our accounting policies and practices are in compliance with statement of position 972 “software revenue recognition” as amended and staff accounting bulletin no 101 “revenue recognition in financial statements” 

  

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 

  

based on whether the sale is product or service related we recognize revenue as follows product sales are recognized at the time of shipment subscription customer support and hosted service revenues are recognized ratably over the contract periods customer consulting and training revenues are recognized as the services are performed 

  

allowance for bad debts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments no single customer is significant to autodesk and as such our exposure to uncollectible trade receivables is generally limited 

  

estimated reserves are determined based upon historical loss patterns the number of days that billings are past due and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with specific problem accounts while we believe our existing reserve for doubtful accounts is adequate and proper additional reserves may be required should the financial condition of our customers deteriorate or as unusual circumstances arise 

  

product return reserves with the exception of contracts with certain distributors our sales contracts do not contain specific productreturn privileges however we permit our distributors and resellers to return product in certain instances generally when new product releases supercede older versions 

  

over the past three years product returns as a percentage of revenues have ranged from 3 to 5 percent annually the product return reserves are based on estimated channel inventory levels and the timing of new product introductions and other factors while we believe our accounting practice for establishing and monitoring product returns reserves is proper any adverse activity or unusual circumstances could result in an increase in reserve levels in the period in which such determinations are made 

  

realizability of longlived assets we review the realizability of our longlived assets and related intangible assets annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable we consider some of the following factors important in deciding when to perform an impairment review significant underperformance of a business or product line relative to budget shifts in business strategies which impact the continued uses of the assets significant negative industry or economic trends and the results of past impairment reviews 

  

in assessing the recoverability of these longlived assets we first determine their fair values which are based on assumptions regarding the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that could reasonably be generated by these assets impairment charges if any result in situations when the fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values during fiscal 2002 we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 23 million the writeoff of goodwill primarily related to an acquired gis business and resulted from a strategic decision to abandon the underlying product line 

  

we will continue to evaluate the values of our longlived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur we may be required to record impairment charges 

  

deferred tax assets we currently have 609 million of deferred tax assets mostly arising from net operating losses reserves and timing differences for purchased technologies and capitalized software we perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these deferred tax assets which is principally dependent upon our achievement of projected future taxable income in specific geographies our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors these changes if any may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax assets resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determinations are made 

  

restructuring expenses associated with office closures during the year ended january 31 2002 we recorded restructuring charges of 192 million related to the closure of several domestic and international offices these charges were based upon the projected rental payments through the remaining terms of the underlying operating leases offset by projected subleasing income the projected subleasing income amounts were provided by thirdparty real estate brokers and were based on assumptions for each of the real estate markets where the leased offices were located should real estate markets worsen and we are not able to sublease the properties as expected we will record additional expenses in the quarterly period when such determinations 

are made this situation occurred during fiscal 2002 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 we recorded additional charges as a result of the inability to sublease offices abandoned earlier in the fiscal year if the real estate markets subsequently improve and we are able to sublease the properties earlier or at more favorable rates than projected we will reverse some of the underlying restructuring accruals which will result in increased net income in the period when such determinations are made 

  

results of operations 

  

net revenues our net revenues for fiscal 2002 were 9475 million as compared to 9363 million in fiscal 2001 increased net revenues in asiapacific and the americas were partially offset by lower sales in europe 

  

net revenues for the discreet segment were 1561 million in fiscal 2002 as compared to 1932 million in the prior fiscal year as advanced system sales were significantly affected by a slowdown in the media advertising and entertainment sectors should this slowdown continue the discreet segment net revenues in fiscal 2003 will be adversely affected 

  

net revenues for the design solutions segment were 7914 million in fiscal 2002 as compared to 7431 million in the prior fiscal year the design solutions segment consists primarily of the geographic information services “gis” building industry manufacturing and platform technology divisions these divisions have industryspecific focuses 

  

net revenues from sales of gis products increased to 1164 million in fiscal 2002 from 975 million in fiscal 2001 net revenues from sales of building industry products increased to 829 million in fiscal 2002 from 576 million in fiscal 2001 net revenues from sales of platform technology products increased to 4619 million in fiscal 2002 from 4540 million in fiscal 2001 these increases were partially offset by lower net revenues from sales of manufacturing products which were 1302 million in fiscal 2002 as compared to 1340 million in fiscal 2001 the overall increase in segment revenues was attributable to a stronger portfolio of product offerings such as autodesk inventor autodesk architectural desktop autodesk map autodesk land desktop and autocad 2002 and increased customer demand for greater productivity tools although we have been reducing our dependence on autocad sales of autocad and autocad upgrades continue to be a significant portion of our net revenues such sales which are reflected in the net revenues for the platform technology division accounted for approximately 32 percent of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2002 and 33 percent of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2001 

  

the stronger value of the us dollar relative to international currencies had a negative impact on net revenues in fiscal 2002 had exchange rates from the prior year been in effect in fiscal 2002 translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been 232 million higher continued strength of the us dollar would have a negative impact on net revenues in fiscal 2003 

  

international sales accounted for approximately 65 percent of our net revenues in fiscal 2002 as compared to 64 percent in the prior fiscal year we believe that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total revenues many world economies are in the midst of current economic slowdowns economic weakness in any of the countries which contribute a significant portion of our net revenues would have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our net revenues for fiscal 2001 were 9363 million as compared to 8481 million in fiscal 2000 the 10 percent growth reflected increased net revenues of 14 percent in the americas and 22 percent in asiapacific as compared to the prior fiscal year despite unfavorable exchange rate movements net revenues in europe remained flat compared to the prior fiscal year 

  

net revenues for the discreet segment increased 11 percent in fiscal 2001 as compared to the prior fiscal year this was due to increased demand for our highend special effects postproduction and broadcast products 

  

net revenues for the design solutions segment increased 10 percent in fiscal 2001 as compared to the prior fiscal year net revenues from sales of gis products increased to 975 million in fiscal 2001 from 710 million in fiscal 2000 net revenues from sales of building industry products increased to 576 million in fiscal 2001 as compared to 512 million in fiscal 2000 net revenues from sales of manufacturing products increased to 1340 million in fiscal 2001 from 1120 million in fiscal 2000 net revenues from sales of platform technology products increased to 4540 million in fiscal 2001 from 4402 million in fiscal 2000 these increases resulted from greater demand for our products especially autodesk inventor and primarily all gis product offerings sales of autocad and autocad upgrades which are reflected in the net revenues for the platform technology division accounted for approximately 33 percent of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2001 and 37 percent of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2000 

  

the value of the us dollar relative to international currencies had a negative impact on net revenues in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 international sales including exports from the us accounted for approximately 64 percent of our net revenues in fiscal 2001 as compared to 65 percent in fiscal 2000 

  

product returns consisting principally of stock rotation are recorded as a reduction of revenues over the past three years product returns as a percentage of revenues have ranged from 3 to 5 percent annually we anticipate that the level of product returns in future periods will continue to be impacted by channel inventory levels the timing of new product releases as well as the quality and market acceptance of new products 

  

cost of revenues cost of revenues includes the cost of compact discs cost of hardware sold mainly workstations manufactured by silicon graphics costs associated with transferring autodesk’s software to electronic media printing of user manuals and packaging materials shipping and handling costs royalties amortization of purchased technology and capitalized software and cost of service contracts 

  

when expressed as a percentage of net revenues cost of revenues was 16 percent in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 lower material costs as a result of product mix and lower software amortization costs were offset by higher royalty expenses 

  

cost of revenues were 16 percent of net revenues in fiscal 2001 as compared to 17 percent of net revenues in fiscal 2000 this lower percentage in fiscal 2001 was primarily due to reduced royalty costs of 41 million that resulted from the expiration of some of our royalty arrangements in fiscal 2000 and reduced software amortization costs offset in part by higher employeerelated expenses and professional fees 

  

in the future cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues is likely to continue to be impacted by the mix of product sales increased consulting and hosted service costs software amortization costs royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products and the geographic distribution of sales however we expect future cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues to remain within an historical range of 16 to 20 percent 

  

marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses include salaries dealer and sales commissions and travel and facility costs for our marketing sales dealer training and support personnel these expenses also include programs aimed at increasing revenues such as advertising trade shows and expositions as well as various sales and promotional programs designed for specific sales channels and end users 

  

marketing and sales expenses were 36 percent of net revenues in fiscal 2002 compared to 34 percent of net revenues in the prior fiscal year this difference was primarily due to higher employeerelated expenses resulting from an increasing focus on direct sales to major accounts 

  

marketing and sales expenses were 34 percent of net revenues in fiscal 2001 compared to 40 percent of net revenues in fiscal 2000 this lower percentage in fiscal 2001 was partially due to lower employeerelated expenses of approximately 28 million and some 160 million less in advertising and promotion costs 

  

we expect to continue to invest in marketing and sales of our products to develop market opportunities and to promote our competitive position accordingly we expect marketing and sales expenses to continue to be significant both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues 

  

research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software engineers contract development fees and depreciation of computer equipment used in software development research and development expenses were 1686 million in fiscal 2002 compared to 1705 million in the prior fiscal year general reductions in spending were partially offset by higher employee related costs efforts associated with our location services initiatives and research and development costs incurred by redspark prior to its dissolution in october 2001 

  

research and development costs were 1705 million in fiscal 2001 compared to 1640 million in fiscal 2000 the higher expenditures in fiscal 2001 were primarily due to additional spending by acquired businesses offset in part by lower facilities costs 

  

we expect that research and development spending will continue to be significant in fiscal 2003 as we continue to support product development efforts by our market groups 

  

general and administrative general and administrative expenses include our information systems finance human resources legal and other administrative operations general and administrative expenses were 14 percent of net revenues in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 higher employeerelated costs were offset by lower professional fees and depreciation costs 

  

general and administrative expenses were 14 percent in fiscal 2001 compared to 16 percent in fiscal 2000 the lower percentage in fiscal 2001 was primarily due to lower employeerelated spending and lower spending related to information systems 

  

we currently expect that in the coming year general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues will remain generally consistent with the level experienced in fiscal 2002 

  

amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles was 209 million in fiscal 2002 265 million in fiscal 2001 and 306 million in fiscal 2000 the steady decline between years was due to some intangibles becoming fully amortized of the 209 million fiscal 2002 amortization expense 199 million related to goodwill amortization beginning in fiscal 2003 goodwill will no longer be amortized see “recently issued accounting standards” for further discussion 

  

restructuring and other during fiscal 2002 autodesk recognized 336 million of restructuring and other charges these charges resulted from restructuring activities 245 million inprocess research and development expenses related to the acquisition of media 100 32 million the winddown costs associated with the dissolution of redspark 36 million and a goodwill writeoff of 23 million the writeoff of goodwill primarily related to an acquired gis business and resulted from a strategic decision to abandon the underlying product line 

  

the restructuring costs which were part of a formal exit plan approved by our board of directors during the second quarter of fiscal 2002 were in connection with our effort to reduce operating expense levels during that same quarter we reduced our revenue estimates for the remainder of fiscal 2002 as a result of the restructuring we expect to realize immediate pretax savings of 60 million per quarter and increased cash flows of 40 million per quarter these savings are expected to last for the next several quarters and the pretax savings will be reflected in each ongoing cost and expense line item in the consolidated statements of income both the pretax and cash flow savings will be reinvested in other parts of the business 

  

we plan to record restructuring costs of approximately 10 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 related to the consolidation of additional european offices also we may need to record additional restructuring charges in fiscal 2003 associated with previously abandoned offices the reserves established during fiscal 2002 were in part based on subleasing assumptions should we be unable to sublease the office spaces as expected we will record additional expenses in the quarterly period when such determinations are made 

  

during fiscal 2001 we reversed 12 million of accruals 10 million of which related to a restructuring reserve established in fiscal 2000 the accruals were settled for less than originally estimated 

  

restructuring and other charges in fiscal 2000 of 347 million consisted primarily of discreet logic inc and vision acquisitionrelated charges and a corporate restructuring that occurred in that year 

  

for additional information regarding the restructuring and other charges recorded over the past three fiscal years see note 11 restructuring and other in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

interest and other income interest and other income which consists primarily of investment income and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions was 191 million in fiscal 2002 210 million in fiscal 2001 and 232 million in fiscal 2000 investment income fluctuates based on average cash and marketable securities balances average maturities and interest rates the decrease in interest and other income between fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000 was primarily due to a trend of declining interest rates on the investment of cash and marketable securities balances 

  

gain on disposal of affiliate during the third quarter of fiscal 2002 we recognized a onetime noncash gain of 95 million related to the dissolution of redspark a development stage company because we owned greater than 50 percent of the voting stock we had been consolidating redspark’s operating losses since redspark was formed in april 2000 redspark’s expenses which were primarily research and development related were included within the operating expense categories of our statement of income the gain which resulted from the reversal of the minority interest liability balance represents the reversal of cumulative losses recognized in excess of the 32 million we originally invested 

  

provision for income taxes absent the impact of the gain on disposal of affiliate our effective income tax rate was 30 percent in fiscal 2002 and 32 percent in both fiscal 2001 and 2000 there was no tax expense from the onetime gain on disposal of affiliate since we had never recognized any tax benefits from our allocable share of redspark’s accumulated losses consistent with previous years the effective tax rate for fiscal 2002 is less than the federal statutory rate of 35 percent due to the benefits associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate research credits and taxexempt interest partially offset by nondeductible goodwill amortization the fiscal 2002 tax rate was lower than the fiscal 2001 and 2000 tax rates due to a relatively higher impact of these permanent items 

  

our future effective tax rate may be impacted by the amount of benefits associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate research credits and taxexempt interest we believe that our fiscal 2003 effective tax rate will be less than 30 percent primarily due to the adoption of new accounting rules that result in the discontinuation of goodwill amortization see “recently issued accounting standards” for further discussion 

  

at january 31 2002 we had net deferred tax assets of 609 million realization of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate approximately 1500 million of future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions we believe that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize these assets 

  

equity in net loss of affiliate in august 2001 we acquired the remaining 60 percent interest in buzzsaw that we did not own consequently from the date of the acquisition buzzsaw’s ongoing revenues and costs and expenses have been included in each of the respective line items in our consolidated statements of income 

  

we recognized equity in net losses of 12 million in fiscal 2002 and 163 million in fiscal 2001 representing our proportionate share of buzzsaw’s losses during those periods in april 2000 we invested 175 million in buzzsaw and maintained a 40 percent interest loss recognition was suspended during the first quarter of 2002 after we fully expensed all previous investments in buzzsaw 

  

business combinations 

  

buzzsaw 

  

in august 2001 we acquired the remaining outstanding stock of buzzsaw that we did not own for 150 million in cash plus the assumption of 133 million of liabilities prior to the acquisition we held a 40 percent interest in buzzsaw a privately held company that provides leading online collaboration applications to improve efficiencies and reduce costs for the building industry 

  

we accounted for this acquisition under statement of financial accounting standards no 141 “business combinations” “sfas 141” the purchase consideration was allocated principally to a deferred tax asset in recognition of a significant amount of buzzsaw net operating loss and credit carryforwards that we expect to utilize to reduce our future tax obligations 

  

software division of media 100 inc “media 100” 

  

in october 2001 we acquired the software division of media 100 for 160 million in cash we accounted for this acquisition under the provisions of sfas 141 of the total purchase price we allocated 32 million to inprocess research and development “iprd” 74 million to developed technology 06 million to brand names that have an estimated useful life of 5 years and 43 million to goodwill the iprd was expensed immediately since the technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and no alternative future uses could be identified 

  

as of the acquisition date the iprd substantially consisted of the hitman product an enterprise encoding system that automates the encoding process and allows for the encoding of multiple jobs at the same time the hitman product was 75 percent complete at the time with 04 million of estimated remaining costs to reach technological feasibility we recently released this product with actual costs to complete that approximated the initial 04 million estimate 

  

in valuing the developed and inprocess technologies we used a discounted cash flow analysis based on projected net revenues cost of revenues operating expenses and income taxes resulting from such technologies over a 6year period the projected financial results which were discounted using a 40 percent rate for the developed technology and a 50 percent rate for the iprd were based on expectations of media 100 on a standalone basis 

  

the revenue projections for developed technologies which considered the release dates of new products assumed a gradual decline we based the revenue projections for the iprd on expected trends in technology and the timing of new product introductions 

  

vision solutions “vision” 

  

on april 22 1999 we acquired vision a vendor of enterprise automated mappingfacilities managementgeographic information systems amfmgis solutions of the 260 million purchase price which was paid in cash 33 million represented the value of iprd that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use and as such was expensed during fiscal 2000 of the remaining purchase price 176 million was allocated to goodwill and 21 million was allocated to other identified intangibles 

  

as of the acquisition date the iprd consisted of the development of two products vision 53 which was 60 percent complete at the time and vision electric 23 which was 39 percent complete both projects which were originally expected to be completed in late fiscal 2000 were released two years ago the projects were completed at an amount approximately equal to the original estimate of 14 million 

  

in valuing the developed and inprocess technologies at the acquisition date we used a discounted cash flow analysis based on projected net revenues cost of revenues operating expenses and income taxes resulting from such technologies over a 4year period the projected financial results which were discounted using a 20 percent rate for the developed technology and a 25 percent rate for the inprocess technology were based on expectations for vision on a standalone basis and excluded any synergistic benefits that we expected to achieve after the acquisition 

  

the revenue projections for the developed technologies which considered the release dates of new products assumed a gradual decline we based the revenue projections for the iprd on expected trends in technology and the timing of our new product introductions 

  

although actual financial results to date have been lower than originally forecasted autodesk has successfully integrated the vision technology with gis applications and products that were released in fiscal 2002 these gis applications and products generate sufficient cash flows to realize the remaining value of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 

  

discreet logic inc “discreet” 

  

in march 1999 we acquired discreet in a business combination accounted for as a pooling of interests the transaction resulted in the issuance of an aggregate of approximately 200 million shares of autodesk common stock in exchange for discreet’s outstanding common stock accordingly all prior period consolidated financial statements were restated to include the combined results of operations of discreet as though it had always been a part of autodesk 

  

prior to the acquisition discreet’s fiscal year ended on june 30 in conforming discreet’s fiscal year end to ours we recorded a 50 million adjustment to retained earnings during fiscal 2000 

  

recent events 

  

revit technology corporation “revit” 

  

in april 2002 we acquired revit for 1330 million in cash the acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase under sfas 141 the addition of revit complements our existing family of building industry applications with a parametric building modeler for customers to design coordinate and integrate information about the entire building 

  

recently issued accounting standards 

  

during july 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas 141 this statement requires all business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and redefines goodwill and other intangibles that should be recognized separate from goodwill sfas 141 was effective for all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 both the acquisitions of buzzsaw and media 100 were accounted for under sfas 141 

  

during july 2001 the financial accounting standards board also issued statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “sfas 142” this statement requires among other things that goodwill not be amortized but be tested for impairment at least annually application of sfas 142 is required immediately for business combinations completed after june 30 2001 however for transactions completed prior to this date we plan to adopt the provisions of sfas 142 on february 1 2002 we recently completed an assessment of the annual goodwill impairment test pursuant to sfas 142 and believe that none of the goodwill balances as of january 31 2002 are impaired 

  

during august 2001 the financial accounting standards board also issued statement of financial accounting standards no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” “sfas 144” sfas 144 is effective at the start of fiscal 2003 and supercedes statement of financial accounting standards no 121 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of” and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 30 relating to the disposal of a segment of business we are currently assessing the impact of sfas 144 on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

at january 31 2002 our principal sources of liquidity were cash and marketable securities totaling 5046 million accounts receivable of 1405 million and a 750 million line of credit with a financial institution other than operating leases we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing arrangements nor any special purpose entities 

  

during fiscal 2002 we generated 2102 million of cash from operating activities as compared to 1961 million in fiscal 2001 cash flows from operating activities together with the proceeds from stock issuances resulting from our employee stock plans continue to be our principal means of generating cash during fiscal 2002 the cash generated was used to fund the repurchase of 53 million shares of our common stock for 973 million the acquisition of businesses for 343 million capital and other expenditures of 451 million and dividend payments totaling 131 million 

  

between november 1999 and march 2001 the board of directors approved plans to repurchase up to 440 million shares of our common stock of these 440 million shares 295 million have been repurchased as of january 31 2002 the purpose of the stock repurchase program is among other things to help offset the dilution to earnings per share caused by the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans 

  

we have a us line of credit permitting shortterm unsecured borrowings of up to 750 million which may be used from time to time for working capital or other business needs this credit facility contains restrictive covenants that among other provisions require autodesk to maintain certain financial ratios during fiscal 2002 and at january 31 2002 we were in compliance with these restrictive covenants as of january 31 2002 there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement which expires in january 2003 

  

we generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments principal commitments at january 31 2002 consisted of obligations under operating leases for facilities and some computer equipment at january 31 2002 the future minimum lease payments under these lease commitments were as follows 351 million in 2003 311 million in 2004 250 million in 2005 190 million in 2006 86 million in 2007 and 141 million thereafter of these amounts 175 million has been included in our restructuring accruals at january 31 2002 

  

in april 2002 we acquired revit technology corporation for 1330 million in cash the addition of revit complements our existing family of building industry applications with a parametric building modeler for customers to design coordinate and integrate information about an entire building 

  

we believe our existing cash cash equivalents marketable securities available line of credit and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated shortterm and longterm cash requirements longterm cash requirements other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the development of new software products and incremental product offerings resulting from the enhancement of existing products financing anticipated growth dividend payments the share repurchase programs the acquisition of businesses software products or technologies complementary to our business and capital expenditures capital expenditures for fiscal 2003 are currently anticipated to approximate what was incurred during fiscal 2002 but could be reduced if our growth is less than anticipated 

  

our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations to minimize the impact of these fluctuations we use foreign currency option contracts and forward contracts to hedge our exposure on anticipated transactions and forward contracts to hedge our exposure on firm commitments primarily certain payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies our foreign currency instruments by policy have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period the principal currencies hedged during fiscal 2002 were the euro british pound canadian dollar and japanese yen we monitor our foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions 

  

risk factors which may impact future operating results 

  

we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks many of which are beyond our control the following discussion highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on future results of operations if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted causing the trading price of our common stock to decline 

  

general economic conditions may reduce our net revenues and harm our business 

  

as our business has grown we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions because of the recent slowdown in the us and other countries’ economies many customers are delaying or reducing technology purchases the impact of this slowdown on us particularly in countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenues is difficult to predict but it may result in reductions in sales of our products longer sales cycles slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition in addition weakness in the enduser market could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could in turn delay paying their obligations to us which would increase our credit risk exposure any of these events would likely harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our operating results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenues and operating results difficult to predict 

  

our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include among other things the timing of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors changes in marketing or operating expenses changes in product pricing or product mix platform changes delays in product releases distribution channel management changes in compensation practices the timing of large systems sales and general economic conditions particularly in countries where we derive a significant portion of our net revenues 

  

we have also experienced fluctuations in operating results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic conditions in particular our operating results in europe during the third quarter are usually impacted by a slow summer period and the asia pacific operations typically experience seasonal slowing in the third and fourth quarters 

  

additionally our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term accordingly any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability further gross margins may be adversely affected if our sales of lowend computer aided design products and autocad upgrades which historically have had lower margins grow at a faster rate than sales of our highermargin products 

  

existing and increased competition in the design software market may reduce our net revenues and profits 

  

the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of desktop computers with continually expanding capacity at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry the design 

software market in particular is fairly mature and characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which we compete both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies in addition some of our competitors have greater financial technical sales and marketing and other resources furthermorethe availability of thirdparty application software is a competitive factor within the computer aided design market because of these and other factors competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenues and profit margins and loss of market share any of which would likely harm our business 

  

we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer new products and to continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to reliability performance ease of use range of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation price and training 

  

because we derive a substantial portion of our net revenues from a limited number of products if these products are not successful our net revenues will be adversely affected 

  

we derive a substantial portion of our net revenues from sales of autocad software autocad upgrades and products that are interoperable with autocad as such any factor adversely affecting sales of autocad and autocad upgrades including product life cycle market acceptance product performance and reliability reputation price competition and the availability of thirdparty applications would likely harm our operating results 

  

net revenues or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline which could harm our business 

  

the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors including the following net revenues or earnings shortfalls and changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors quarterly variations in our or our competitors’ results of operations developments in our industry and general market conditions and other factors including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 

  

in addition stock prices for many companies in the technology sector have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies after periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management’s attention and resources which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

  

our efforts to develop and introduce new products and service offerings expose us to risks such as costs related to product defects and large expenditures that may not result in additional net revenues 

  

rapid technological change as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences characterize the software industry the software products we offer are complex and despite extensive testing and quality control may contain errors or defects these defects or errors could result in corrective releases to our software products damage to our reputation loss of revenues an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products any of which would likely harm our business 

  

additionally we are devoting significant resources to the development of technologies and service offerings to address demands in the marketplace for increased connectivity and use of digital data created by computer 

aided design software as a result we are transitioning to new business models requiring a considerable investment of technical and financial resources such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs or competitors may introduce new products and services that will achieve acceptance among our current customers adversely affecting our competitive position 

  

disruptions with third party developer and licensing relationships could adversely impact our business 

  

independent firms and contractors perform some of our product development activities while other technologies are licensed from third parties we generally either own or license the software developed by third parties because talented development personnel are in high demand independent developers including those who currently develop products for us may not be able to provide development support to us in the future similarly we may not be able to obtain and renew license agreements on favorable terms if at all and any failure to do so could harm our business 

  

our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with thirdparty developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles in particular markets this disruption could negatively impact these thirdparty developers and end users which could harm our business 

  

our international operations expose us to significant regulatory intellectual property collections exchange fluctuations and other risks which could adversely impact our future net revenues 

  

we anticipate that international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues risks inherent in our international operations include the following unexpected changes in regulatory practices and tariffs difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations longer collection cycles for accounts receivable potential changes in tax laws and laws regarding the management of data greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property and the impact of fluctuating exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business 

  

our international results may also be impacted by general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets or in specific large foreign markets these and other factors may adversely impact our future international operations and consequently our business as a whole 

  

our risk management strategy uses derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency option contracts and forward contracts for the purpose of hedging foreign currency market exposures which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations 

  

if we do not maintain our relationship with the members of our distribution channel our ability to generate net revenues will be adversely affected 

  

we sell our software products primarily to distributors and resellers our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our reseller network computer software dealers and distributors are typically not highly capitalized and have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction and may do so in the future in addition the changing distribution models resulting from the internet from increased focus on direct sales to major accounts or from twotiered distribution may impact our reseller network in the future while no single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2002 2001 or 2000 the loss of or a significant reduction in business with any one of our major international distributors or large us resellers could harm our business 

  

product returns could exceed our estimates and harm our net revenues 

  

with the exception of contracts with some distributors our sales contracts do not contain specific productreturn privileges however we permit our distributors and resellers to return product in certain instances generally when new product releases supercede older versions we anticipate that product returns in future periods will continue to be impacted by product update cycles new product releases and software quality 

  

we establish reserves for stock balancing and product rotation these reserves are based on estimated channel inventory levels and the timing of new product introductions and other factors while we maintain strict measures to monitor these reserves actual product returns may differ from our reserve estimates and such differences could harm our business 

  

if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights our business could be harmed 

  

we rely on a combination of patents copyright and trademark laws trade secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software products or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary policing unauthorized use of our software products is timeconsuming and costly while we have recovered some revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists and software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem furthermore our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop similar technology 

  

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 

  

we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows and as the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps infringement invalidity claims or misappropriation claims may be asserted against us and any such assertions could harm our business any such claims whether with or without merit could be timeconsuming to defend result in costly litigation and diversion of resources cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in addition such royalty or license agreements if required may not be available on acceptable terms if at all which would likely harm our business 

  

we rely on third party technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies our product and service development may be delayed 

  

we rely on certain software that we license from third parties including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions these thirdparty software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and the software may not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors the loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software could be developed identified licensed and integrated which would likely harm our business 

  

in addition for certain of our online collaboration applications and services we rely on third party hardware and services financial difficulties or even failure of these third parties may impact our ability to deliver such online collaboration applications and as a result may adversely impact our business 

  

the loss of key personnel or the inability to attract and retain additional personnel could harm our business 

  

our continued growth and success depends significantly on the continued service of highly skilled employees our ability to attract and retain employees is dependent on a number of factors including our 

continued ability to grant stock incentive awards the loss of key employees or inability to recruit new employees would negatively impact our business in addition we may experience increased compensation costs to attract and retain skilled personnel 

  

our business could suffer as a result of risks associated with strategic acquisitions and investments 

  

we periodically acquire or invest in businesses software products and technologies that are complementary to our business through strategic alliances debt and equity investments and the like for example in april 2002 we acquired revit the risks associated with such acquisitions or investments include among others the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the companies the failure to realize anticipated synergies and the diversion of management’s time and attention in addition such investments and acquisitions may involve significant transactionrelated costs we may not be successful in overcoming such risks and such investments and acquisitions may negatively impact our business in addition such investments and acquisitions may contribute to potential fluctuations in quarterly results of operations the fluctuations could arise from mergerrelated costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or writeoffs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions these costs or charges could negatively impact results of operations for a given period or cause lack of a consistent increase quarter to quarter in our operating results

our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage our foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations contracts are primarily denominated in euro swiss francs canadian dollars british pounds and japanese yen we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

  

a sensitivity analysis was performed on our hedging portfolio as of january 31 2002 this analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent appreciation of the us dollar from january 31 2002 would increase the fair value of our forward exchangeoption contracts by 77 million conversely a hypothetical 10 percent depreciation of the dollar from january 31 2002 would decrease the fair value of our forward exchangeoption contracts by 64 million we do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows as a result of these foreign currency forward and option contracts 

  

interest rate sensitivity 

  

we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities including those classified as security deposits of 3678 million at january 31 2002 these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations and will decrease in market value if interest rates increase 

  

a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of january 31 2002 this sensitivity analysis is based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus 50 plus 100 or plus 150 basis points over 6month and 12month time horizons for the 6month time horizon the market value changes for a 50 100 or 150 basis point increase were reductions of 18 million 36 million and 53 million respectively for the 12month time horizon the market value changes for a 50 100 or 150 basis point increase were reductions of 15 million 31 million and 46 million respectively 

  

we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy guidelines which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue issuer or type of instrument 

  

investments in privatelyheld businesses 

  

we have an investment portfolio with a net book value of approximately 41 million as of january 31 2002 that includes minority equity investments in several privatelyheld technology companies many of which are in the development stage we account for these minority equity investments using the cost method of accounting because our ownership interests are less than 20 percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence on the investees 

  

these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never develop into commercially viable businesses we assess the value of these investments on a regular basis and when we identify other than temporary declines in the values of these investments we write down the carrying values to their fair values write downs totaled 29 million in fiscal 2002 26 million in fiscal 2001 and 0 in fiscal 2000 due to the inherently risky nature of these investments we may incur additional losses in the future

product development and introduction

   the majority of our basic research and product development has been
performed in the us while translation and localization of foreignmarket
versions as well as some product development are performed by development
teams or contractors in our local markets our productrelated functions in
europe including software development localization quality assurance and
technical publications are centralized in neuchatel switzerland production
in europe is centralized in ireland and production in asia pacific primarily
takes place in singapore

   the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in
computer hardware operating systems and software as well as changes in
customer requirements and preferences to keep pace with these changes we
maintain an aggressive program of new product development we dedicate
considerable resources to research and development to further enhance our
existing products and to create new products and technologies

   our software products are internally complex and despite extensive testing
and quality control may contain errors or defects these defects or errors
could result in corrective releases to our software products damage to our
reputation loss of revenues an increase in product returns or lack of market
acceptance of our products any of which could harm our business

   we actively recruit and hire experienced software developers and license
and acquire complementary software technologies and businesses in addition
we actively collaborate with and support independent software developers who
offer products that enhance and complement our products

   with the prevalence of new internet technologies and the demand for increased
customer connectivity new platforms and technologies can be expected to be
developed in the design industries we are devoting significant resources to the
development of such technologies as well as transitioning to new business
models requiring a considerable investment of technical and financial
resources such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to
justify their costs or competitors may introduce new products and services that
will achieve acceptance among our current customers adversely affecting our
competitive position

   independent firms and contractors perform some of our product development
activities while other technologies are licensed from third parties we
generally either own or license the software developed by third parties
because talented development personnel are in high demand independent
developers including those who currently develop products for us may not be
able to provide development support in the future similarly we may not be
able to obtain and renew existing license agreements on favorable terms or at
all which could harm our business

                                       4
page

   our business strategy has historically depended in part on our
relationships with thirdparty developers who provide products that expand
the functionality of our design software some developers may elect to support
other products or may experience disruption in product development and
delivery cycles in particular markets this disruption could negatively
impact these thirdparty developers and end users which could harm our
business

marketing and sales

   our customerrelated operations are divided into three geographic regions
the americas europe and asiapacific and are supported by global marketing
and sales organizations these organizations develop and manage overall
marketing and sales programs and work closely with a network of domestic and
foreign offices we sell our software products both directly to customers
which include large corporations and also through distributors and value
added resellers or vars

   in addition we work directly with reseller and distributor sales
organizations computer manufacturers other software developers and
peripheral manufacturers in cooperative advertising promotions and tradeshow
presentations we employ massmarketing techniques such as webcasts seminars
telemarketing direct mailings and advertising in business and trade journals
we have a worldwide user group organization dedicated to the exchange of
information related to the use of our products

   our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the
financial and business condition of our var network although we are not
currently experiencing any material problems with the financial viability of our
var network computer software dealers and distributors are typically not highly
capitalized have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic
contraction and may do so in the future in addition the changing distribution
models resulting from the internet from increased focus on direct sales to
major accounts or from twotiered distribution may impact our var network in the
future while no single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our
consolidated revenues in any of the past three fiscal years the loss of or a
significant reduction in business with any one of our major international
distributors or large us resellers could harm our business

  we intend to continue to make our products available in foreign languages
and expect that foreign sales will continue to contribute a significant
portion of our consolidated revenues

customer and reseller support

   we provide technical support and training to customers through a leveraged
model augmented by programs designed to address specific direct needs we
expect that end users rely primarily on their resellers and distributors for
technical support we support the resellers and distributors through technical
product training sales training classes the internet and direct telephone
support support content is also available on the product support portion of
our internet site there are also a number of user group forums in which
customers are able to share information

   while we expect the resellers and distributors to provide the majority of
technical support to our customers we have developed programs to deliver
direct support to some customers

developer programs

   one of our key strategies is to maintain an openarchitecture design of our
software products to facilitate thirdparty development of complementary
products and industryspecific software solutions this approach enables
customers and third parties to customize our products for a wide variety of
highly specific uses we offer several programs that provide marketing sales
technical support and programming tools to developers who develop addon
applications for our products

                                       5
page

backlog

   we typically ship products shortly after receipt of an order which is
common in the computer software industry accordingly we do not maintain a
significant backlog also the backlog as of any particular date gives no
indication of actual sales for any succeeding period

competition

   we compete with different companies in each of our product groups

   the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability
of desktop computers with continually expanding capabilities at progressively
lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry since customers
increasingly rely on the internet new platforms and technologies can be
expected to be developed in the design industries the design software market
in particular is characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical
markets in which we compete both by entry of competitors with innovative
technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and
technologies in addition the availability of thirdparty application
software is a competitive factor within the cad market because of these and
other factors competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify
in the future increased competition could result in price reductions reduced
net revenues and profit margins and loss of market share any of which could
harm our business furthermore some of our competitors have greater
financial technical sales and marketing and other resources

   we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer
new products and to continue to provide existing product offerings that
compete favorably with respect to reliability performance ease of use range
of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation price and
training

intellectual property and licenses

   we protect our intellectual property through copyright trade secret
patent and trademark laws confidentiality procedures and contractual
provisions nonetheless our intellectual property rights may not be
successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated circumvented or
challenged in addition the laws of various foreign countries where our
products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to
the same extent as us laws our inability to protect our proprietary
information could harm our business

   from time to time we receive claims alleging infringement of a third partys
intellectual property rights including patents any disputes involving our
intellectual property rights or those of another party could lead to costly
litigation and possibly result in our loss of significant rights which could
harm our business

   we retain ownership of software we develop all software is licensed to
users and provided in object code pursuant to either shrinkwrap embedded or
online licenses or executed license agreements these agreements contain
restrictions on duplication disclosure and transfer

   we believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our
intellectual property and the rapid ongoing technological changes in both the
computer hardware and software industries we must rely principally upon
software engineering and marketing skills to maintain and enhance our
competitive market position

   while we have recovered some revenues resulting from the unauthorized use
of our software products we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy
of our software products exists software piracy can be expected to be a
persistent problem

production and suppliers

   production of our software products involves duplication of the software
media and the printing of user manuals the purchase of media and the transfer
of the software programs onto media for distribution to

                                       6
page

customers are performed by us and by licensed subcontractors media for our
products include cdroms and diskettes which are available from multiple
sources user manuals for our products and packaging materials are produced to
our specifications by outside sources domestic production is performed in
leased facilities operated by us some product assembly is also performed by
independent thirdparty contractors international production is performed by
independent thirdparty contractors in ireland and singapore to date we have
not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the production of our
software and documentation

   the discreet division has historically relied on thirdparty vendors to
manufacture and supply all of the hardware components used in its systems
manufacturing consists of assembly including disk array assembly testing
and value added systems integration many of the discreet divisions software
products currently run on workstations manufactured by silicon graphics
additionally the discreet division is dependent on silicon graphics as the
main source for video inputoutput cards used in the systems there are
significant risks associated with this reliance on silicon graphics and the
discreet division may be impacted by unforeseen difficulties associated with
adapting their products to future silicon graphics products and the timing of
the development and release of silicon graphics products

employees

   as of january 31 2001 we had 3484 fulltime employees our future
success is highly dependent on the ability to attract retain and motivate
highly skilled employees









item 2 properties

   our executive offices and the principal offices for product development
domestic marketing and sales and production are located in leased office space
in northern california we also lease office space in various locations
throughout the us for local sales development and technical support
personnel our foreign subsidiaries lease office space for their operations

   we believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet
our requirements for the foreseeable future



item 3 legal proceedings

   we are involved in various legal proceedings arising from the normal course
of business activities in addition in march and april 2000 three class
action complaints were filed against us and certain of our officers and
directors alleging violations of the securities exchange act of 1934 the
united states district court for the northern district of california
consolidated these complaints into one lawsuit in august 2000 the plaintiffs
seek to act on behalf of purchasers of autodesk common stock during the period
between september 14 1998 and may 4 1999 and are seeking unspecified
damages on november 14 2000 the court granted our motion to dismiss the
lawsuit allowing the plaintiffs to amend their complaint the plaintiffs
filed an amended complaint and we have filed a motion to dismiss the amended
complaint the motion is not yet scheduled for a hearing we believe we have
meritorious defenses to the amended complaint and we intend to vigorously
defend the action

   in our opinion resolution of these matters is not expected to have a
material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations or our
financial position however depending on the amount and timing an
unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect our future results
of operations or cash flows in a particular period



item 4 submission of matters to a vote of security holders

   no matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2001

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and
        results of operations

   the discussion in managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations contains trend analyses and other
forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities
act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 all
statements trend analyses and other information contained herein relative to
markets for our products and trends in revenues as well as other statements
including such words as anticipate believe plan estimate expect
goal and intend and other similar expressions involving future trends or
uncertainties constitute forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking
statements are subject to business and economic risks and our actual results
could differ materially from those set forth in the forwardlooking statements
as a result of the factors set forth elsewhere herein including risk factors
which may impact future operating results

basis of presentation

   as a result of two new accounting pronouncements that were effective during
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 we reclassified dealer commissions to
marketing and sales expenses and customerpaid shipping and handling fees to
net revenues see notes 1 and 16 of our consolidated financial statements for
further discussion previously dealer commission costs were reflected as a
direct reduction of net revenues and customerpaid shipping and handling
amounts were reflected as a reduction of cost of revenues historical amounts
have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation the
adoption of these accounting pronouncements did not impact our current or
previously reported net income

results of operations

   net revenues our net revenues for fiscal 2001 were 9363 million as
compared to 8481 million in fiscal 2000 the 10 percent growth reflected
increased net revenues in the americas of 14 percent and in asiapacific of 22
percent as compared to the prior fiscal year despite unfavorable exchange
rate movements net revenues in europe remained flat compared to the prior
fiscal year net revenues for the discreet segment increased 11 percent
compared to the prior fiscal year the net revenues for the design solutions
segment increased 10 percent compared to the prior fiscal year sales of
autocad and autocad upgrades which are reflected in the net revenues for the
design solutions segment accounted for approximately 33 percent of our
consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2001 and 37 percent of our consolidated
net revenues in fiscal 2000

   the stronger value of the us dollar relative to international
currencies had a negative impact on net revenues in fiscal 2001 had exchange
rates from the prior year been in effect in fiscal 2001 translated
international revenue billed in local currencies would have been 325 million
higher unfavorable exchange rates may have a negative impact on net revenues
in fiscal 2002 international sales including exports from the us
accounted for approximately 64 percent of our net revenues in fiscal 2001 as
compared to 65 percent in the prior fiscal year

   our net revenues for fiscal 2000 were 8481 million as compared to 8938
million in fiscal 1999 increases in asiapacifics net revenues of 32 percent
were more than offset by decreases of 13 percent in the americas and 10
percent in europe the overall decrease in net revenues was primarily due to a
decline in sales of autocad and autocad lt on a standalone basis sales of
autocad and autocad upgrades which are reflected in net revenues for the
design solutions segment accounted for approximately 37 percent of our
consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2000 and 45 percent of our consolidated
net revenues in fiscal 1999

   the value of the us dollar relative to international currencies did not
have a significant impact on net revenues in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal
1999 international sales including exports from the us accounted for
approximately 65 percent of our net revenues in fiscal 2000 as compared to 59
percent in fiscal 1999

   product returns consisting principally of stock rotation are recorded as
a reduction of revenues over the past three years product returns as a
percentage of revenues have ranged from 3 to 5 percent annually we

                                      11

anticipate that the level of product returns in future periods will continue
to be impacted by the timing of new product releases as well as the quality
and market acceptance of new products

   cost of revenues cost of revenues includes the cost of diskettes and
compact discs cost of hardware sold mainly workstations manufactured by
silicon graphics costs associated with transferring autodesks software to
electronic media printing of user manuals and packaging materials shipping
and handling costs royalties amortization of purchased technology and
capitalized software software protection locks in certain foreign markets
and cost of service contracts

   when expressed as a percentage of net revenues cost of revenues were 16
percent in fiscal 2001 compared to 17 percent of net revenues in fiscal 2000
this difference was primarily due to reduced royalty costs of 41 million
that resulted from the expiration of some of our royalty arrangements in
fiscal 2000 and reduced software amortization costs offset in part by higher
employeerelated expenses and professional fees

   cost of revenues were 17 percent of net revenues in fiscal 2000 as compared
to 15 percent of net revenues in fiscal 1999 this difference was primarily
due to 1 increases in royalties 2 amortization of capitalized software
for autocad 2000 which was introduced in fiscal 2000 and 3 the april 1999
acquisition of vision solutions or vision which has relatively higher cost
of revenues as a percentage of net revenues than our other products

   in the future cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues will
continue to be impacted by the mix of product sales software amortization
costs royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products and the
geographic distribution of sales

   marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses include salaries dealer
and sales commissions travel and facility costs for our marketing sales
dealer training and support personnel these expenses also include programs
aimed at increasing revenues such as advertising trade shows and
expositions as well as various sales and promotional programs designed for
specific sales channels and end users

   marketing and sales expenses were 34 percent of net revenues in fiscal 2001
compared to 40 percent of net revenues in the prior fiscal year this difference
was due to lower employeerelated expenses of approximately 28 million and
some 160 million less in advertising and promotion costs related to fewer
launches of new or enhanced products

   marketing and sales expenses were 40 percent of net revenues in fiscal 2000
compared to 35 percent in fiscal 1999 the increase was largely due to 1
increased advertising and promotional costs associated with the launch of
several new and enhanced products introduced during fiscal 2000 2 higher
employee costs and 3 incremental costs due to the acquisition of vision

   we expect to continue to invest in marketing and sales of our products to
develop market opportunities and to promote our competitive position
accordingly we expect marketing and sales expenses to continue to be
significant both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues

   research and development research and development expenses consist
primarily of salaries and benefits for software engineers contract
development fees and costs of computer equipment used in software development
research and development expenses were 1705 million in fiscal 2001 compared
to 1640 million in the prior fiscal year lower facilities costs were offset
by additional spending by acquired businesses

   research and development costs were 1640 million in fiscal 2000 compared
to 1571 million in fiscal 1999 the difference was primarily due to higher
employeerelated costs higher costs related primarily to the design 2000
family of products and incremental costs due to the acquisition of vision

   we expect that research and development spending will continue to be
significant in fiscal 2002 as we continue to support product development
efforts by our market groups

                                      12

   general and administrative general and administrative expenses include our
information systems finance human resources legal and other administrative
operations general and administrative expenses were 14 percent of net
revenues in fiscal 2001 as compared to 16 percent of net revenues in the prior
fiscal year this difference was primarily due to lower employeerelated
spending and lower spending related to information systems

   general and administrative expenses were 16 percent of net revenues in
fiscal 2000 compared to 13 percent in fiscal 1999 the difference was
primarily due to higher 1 employeerelated expenses 2 costs incurred to
ensure that our infrastructure was year 2000 compliant 3 consulting fees
related to enhancing the information systems infrastructure and 4
incremental costs related to acquisitions we currently expect that in the
coming year general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net
revenues will remain consistent with the level experienced in fiscal 2001

   amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles amortization of
goodwill and purchased intangibles was 265 million in fiscal 2001 306
million in fiscal 2000 and 287 million in fiscal 1999 the difference
between fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 is due to some intangibles becoming fully
amortized the difference between fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999 was due to
increased amortization expense arising from the april 1999 acquisition of
vision we expect amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles to
continue to decline in future periods as asset balances reach the end of their
respective amortization periods

   nonrecurring credits charges during fiscal 2001 we reversed 12 million
related to onetime accruals 10 million of which related to a restructuring
reserve established in fiscal 2000 the accruals were settled for less than
originally estimated during fiscal 2001 the restructuring program was
substantially completed

   nonrecurring charges in fiscal 2000 347 million consisted primarily of
discreet logic inc or discreet and vision acquisitionrelated charges and a
corporate restructuring that occurred during the third quarter

   nonrecurring charges in fiscal 1999 197 million consisted primarily of
acquisitionrelated charges resulting from our purchase of genius cad software
gmbh genius and other charges that involved the consolidation of various
development centers writeoff of purchased technologies associated with these
development centers and the elimination of 87 positions in asia pacific

   for additional information regarding the nonrecurring charges recorded over
the past three fiscal years see note 12 nonrecurring charges in the notes to
consolidated financial statements

   litigation accrual reversal in fiscal 1999 we reversed 186 million of
accruals associated with litigation matters of the amount 182 million
related to final adjudication of a claim involving a tradesecret
misappropriation brought by vermont microsystems inc

   interest and other income interest and other income net was 210 million
in fiscal 2001 232 million in fiscal 2000 and 171 million in fiscal 1999
the difference between fiscal 2001 and 2000 was related to lower investment
balances resulting from cash used for share repurchase activity the fiscal
1999 balance includes our 27 million reversal of an interest accrual
resulting from the closure of the vermont microsystems litigation matter and
a 13 million gain associated with the sale of various technical programs and
intangible assets excluding these fiscal 1999 amounts the difference in
interest and other income net between fiscal 2000 and 1999 was largely due to
increases in average cash and marketable securities balances resulting from
cash provided by operating activities and common stock issuances

   provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was 320 percent
in fiscal 2001 320 percent in fiscal 2000 and 366 percent in fiscal 1999
consistent with fiscal 2000 the effective tax rate for fiscal 2001 is less
than the federal statutory rate of 35 percent due to the benefits associated
with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the federal
statutory rate research credits and taxexempt interest partially offset by
nondeductible goodwill amortization the fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 rates
are lower than the fiscal 1999 rate due to a relatively higher impact of these
permanent items our future effective tax rate may be impacted by the amount of
benefits associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates
different from the federal statutory rate research credits tax exempt interest
and the amount of nondeductible goodwill amortization

                                      13

   at january 31 2001 we had gross deferred tax assets of 640 million a
portion of the assets recognized is realizable based on our ability to offset
existing deferred tax liabilities realization of the remaining portion of
these assets is dependent on our ability to generate significant future
taxable income we believe that sufficient income will be earned in the future
to realize these assets we will evaluate the realizablility of the deferred
tax assets quarterly and assess the need for valuation allowances

   equity in net loss of affiliate the 163 million equity in net loss of
affiliate represents our proportionate share of buzzsawcoms april 2000
through january 2001 losses in april 2000 we invested an additional 175
million in buzzsawcom which we formed during the third quarter of fiscal
2000 we expect our equity in net losses of buzzsawcom to continue to be
significant in future periods if additional investments are made for
additional information regarding our investment in buzzsawcom see note 5
investment in affiliatebuzzsawcom inc in the notes to consolidated
financial statements

   redspark inc during the second quarter of fiscal 2001 we formed
redspark inc autodesk currently maintains a majority interest in redspark
and as such the financial position and results of operations of redspark are
consolidated and included within the operating expense categories of our
statement of operations we expect to continue to consolidate redspark through
most of fiscal 2002 the extent of our exposure to redsparks results of
operations is dependent upon our future level of ownership interest which will
depend in part on the amount of redspark equity issued to other investors in the
future for additional information regarding redspark see note 6 minority
interestredspark inc in the notes to consolidated financial statements

business combinations

 discreet

   in march 1999 we acquired discreet in a business combination accounted for
as a pooling of interests the transaction resulted in the issuance of an
aggregate of approximately 100 million shares of autodesk common stock in
exchange for discreets outstanding common stock accordingly all prior
period consolidated financial statements presented were restated to include
the combined results of operations of discreet as though it had always been a
part of autodesk

   prior to the acquisition discreets fiscal year ended on june 30 as a
result of differing yearends our consolidated statements of operations
stockholders equity and cash flows for the fiscal years ended january 31
1999 were combined with discreets financial statements for the twelve months
ended december 31 1998

   in addition discreets january 1999 results have been excluded from the
consolidated statement of operations as a result of changing discreets year
end to january 31 in january 1999 discreet recognized net revenues of 38
million and incurred a net loss of 50 million this loss was recorded as an
adjustment to retained earnings during fiscal 2000

 vision

   on april 22 1999 we acquired vision a vendor of enterprise automated
mappingfacilities managementgeographic information systems amfmgis
solutions at the time autodesk viewed the acquisition as a unique
opportunity to obtain server technology and an implementation service business
that would allow autodesk to enter the enterprise market and market both
visions and autodesks products to all levels within an organization of the
260 million purchase price which was paid in cash 33 million represented
the value of inprocess research and development iprd that had not yet
reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use and as
such was expensed during fiscal 2000 of the remaining purchase price 176
million was allocated to goodwill and 21 million was allocated to other
intangibles

   as of the acquisition date the iprd consisted of the development of two
products vision 53 which was 60 percent complete at the time and vision
electric 23 which was 39 percent complete both projects

                                      14
page

which were originally expected to be completed in late fiscal 2000 have
already been released the projects were completed at an amount approximately
equal to the original estimate of 14 million

   in valuing the developed and inprocess technologies at the acquisition
date we used a discounted cash flow analysis based on projected net revenues
cost of revenues operating expenses and income taxes resulting from such
technologies over a 4year period the projected financial results which were
discounted using a 20 percent rate for the developed technology and a 25
percent rate for the inprocess technology were based on expectations for
vision on a standalone basis and excluded any synergistic benefits that we
expected to achieve after the acquisition

   the revenue projections for the developed technologies which considered
the release dates of new products assumed a gradual decline we based the
revenue projections for the iprd on expected trends in technology and the
timing of our new product introductions

   although actual financial results to date have been lower than originally
forecasted autodesk has successfully integrated the vision technology with
new applications and products that are expected to be released in fiscal 2002

 genius

   on may 4 1998 we entered into an agreement with genius a german limited
liability company to purchase various mechanical cad software applications
and technologies we accounted for this acquisition under the purchase method
of accounting of the total purchase price of 689 million which was paid in
cash 131 million was allocated to iprd and was expensed 127 million was
allocated to an intangible asset purchased technology and 416 million was
allocated to goodwill

   as of the acquisition date genius had initiated the research and
development effort related to product features and functionality that
currently resides in mechanical products such as autocad mechanical autodesk
inventor and to a lesser degree mechanical desktop the research and
development projects were in varying stages of completion ranging from 20
percent to 45 percent complete as of the acquisition date with total
estimated costs of 15 million to reach technological feasibility at the
time the inprocess projects were completed in fiscal 2000 at an aggregate
amount approximately equal to the original estimated costs to complete

   in valuing the developed and inprocess technologies we used a discounted
cash flow analysis based on projected net revenues cost of revenues
operating expenses and income taxes resulting from such technologies over a 5
year period the projected financial results were discounted using a 15
percent rate for the developed technology and a 20 percent rate for the in
process technology

   the revenue projections for the developed technology which considered
historical product life cycles and anticipated product release dates assumed
a gradual decline over the 5year period the revenue projections for the
iprd assumed higher than historical average sales due to the integration and
expansion of genius products into our worldwide sales channels particularly
in north america and asia pacific which historically had not contributed
significant revenues to genius

   actual results in fiscal 2001 were consistent with the major assumptions
used in the original valuation made at the time of the acquisition such as
the revenue growth rate between years

recently issued accounting standards

   effective november 1 2000 we adopted staff accounting bulletin no 101
revenue recognition in financial statements sab 101 the adoption of sab
101 did not have a material impact on our financial statements

                                      15
page

   effective february 1 2001 we adopted the provisions of statement of
financial accounting standards no 133 accounting for derivative instruments
and hedging activities sfas 133 this statement requires autodesk to
recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value had we adopted
sfas 133 during fiscal 2001 the impact would not have been material the
adoption of sfas 133 on february 1 2001 did not have a material impact on our
financial position

liquidity and capital resources

   cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled 4225 million at
january 31 2001 compared to 5409 million at january 31 2000 the primary
uses of cash during fiscal 2001 were the repurchase of 92 million shares of
our common stock for 3593 million capital and other expenditures of 324
million dividend payments totaling 136 million and an additional investment
in buzzsawcom of 175 million the primary sources of cash were cash
provided by operating activities of 1961 million stock issuances resulting
from our employee stock plans of 1140 million and 140 million of third
party venture funding for redspark

   between november 1999 and march 2001 the board of directors approved plans
to repurchase up to 220 million shares of our common stock of these 220
million shares 121 million have been repurchased as of january 31 2001 the
primary purpose of the stock repurchase programs is to help offset the
dilution to earnings per share caused by the issuance of stock under our
employee stock plans

   we have a us line of credit permitting shortterm unsecured borrowings
of up to 750 million which may be used from time to time for working
capital or other business needs at january 31 2001 there were no borrowings
outstanding under this agreement which expires in january 2002

   principal commitments at january 31 2001 consisted of obligations under
operating leases for facilities and some computer equipment

   we believe that our existing cash cash equivalents marketable securities
available line of credit and cash generated from operations will be sufficient
to satisfy our currently anticipated shortterm and longterm cash
requirements longterm cash requirements other than normal operating
expenses are anticipated for the development of new software products and
incremental product offerings resulting from the enhancement of existing
products financing anticipated growth dividend payments the share
repurchase programs investments in related entities and the acquisition of
businesses software products or technologies complementary to our business

   our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations to
minimize the impact of these fluctuations we use foreign currency option
contracts to hedge our exposure on anticipated transactions and forward
contracts to hedge our exposure on firm commitments primarily certain
payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies our foreign
currency instruments generally have maturities of less than three months and
the option contracts settle before the end of each quarterly period the
principal currencies hedged during fiscal 2001 were the euro british pound
and japanese yen we monitor our foreign exchange exposures to ensure the
overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions

risk factors which may impact future operating results

   we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of
risks many of which are beyond our control the following discussion
highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on
future results of operations

   you should carefully consider these risks before making an investment
decision if any of the following risks actually occur our business
financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted in
that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could
lose all or part of your investment

                                      16
page

our operating results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter
making our future revenues and operating results difficult to predict
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do
so in the future these fluctuations could cause our stock price to
significantly fluctuate or experience declines some of the factors that could
cause our operating results to fluctuate include among other things the timing
of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors changes in
marketing or operating expenses changes in product pricing or product mix
platform changes delays in product releases competitive factors distribution
channel management changes in compensation practices the timing of systems
sales and general economic conditions

   we have also experienced fluctuations in operating results in interim periods
in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic
conditions in particular our operating results in europe during the third
quarter are usually impacted by a slow summer period and the asia pacific
operations typically experience seasonal slowing in the third and fourth
quarters

   additionally our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations
for future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term accordingly
any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and
significant adverse effect on our business further gross margins may be
adversely affected if our sales of lowend cad products and autocad upgrades
which historically have had lower margins grow at a faster rate than sales of
our highermargin products

because we derive a substantial portion of our net revenues from a limited
number of products if these products are not successful our net revenues will
be adversely affected
we derive a substantial portion of our net revenues from sales of autocad
software autocad upgrades and products that are interoperable with autocad as
such any factor adversely affecting sales of autocad and autocad upgrades
including product life cycle market acceptance product performance and
reliability reputation price competition and the availability of thirdparty
applications would likely harm our operating results

existing and increased competition in the design software market may reduce
our net revenues profits and market share
the software industry has limited barriers to entry and the availability of
desktop computers with continually expanding capabilities at progressively lower
prices contributes to the ease of market entry since customers increasingly
rely on the internet new platforms and technologies can be expected to be
developed in the design industries the design software market in particular is
characterized by vigorous competition in each of the vertical markets in which
we compete both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by
consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies in
addition the availability of thirdparty application software is a competitive
factor within the cad market because of these and other factors competitive
conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future increased
competition could result in price reductions reduced net revenues and profit
margins and loss of market share any of which could harm our business
furthermore some of our competitors have greater financial technical sales
and marketing and other resources

  we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer
new products and to continue to provide existing product offerings that
compete favorably with respect to reliability performance ease of use range
of useful features continuing product enhancements reputation price and
training

our efforts to develop and introduce new products expose us to risks such as
costs related to product defects large expenditures that may not result in
additional net revenues and dependence on third party developers
rapid technological change as well as changes in customer requirements and
preferences characterize the software industry the software products we offer
are internally complex and despite extensive testing and quality control may
contain errors or defects these defects or errors could result in corrective
releases to our software products damage to our reputation loss of revenues
an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products any
of which could harm our business

   with the prevalence of new internet technologies and the demand for increased
customer connectivity new platforms and technologies can be expected to be
developed in the design industries we are devoting significant resources to the
development of such technologies as well as transitioning to new business
models requiring a considerable investment of technical and financial
resources such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to
justify their costs or competitors may introduce new products and services that
will achieve acceptance among our current customers adversely affecting our
competitive position

                                      17
page

   independent firms and contractors perform some of our product development
activities while other technologies are licensed from third parties we
generally either own or license the software developed by third parties
because talented development personnel are in high demand independent
developers including those who currently develop products for us may not be
able to provide development support to us in the future similarly we may not
be able to obtain and renew license agreements on favorable terms if at all
and any failure to do so could harm our business

   our business strategy has historically depended in part on our
relationships with thirdparty developers who provide products that expand
the functionality of our design software some developers may elect to support
other products or may experience disruption in product development and
delivery cycles in particular markets this disruption could negatively
impact these thirdparty developers and end users which could harm our
business

our international operations expose us to significant regulatory intellectual
property collections exchange fluctuations and other risks which could
adversely impact our future net revenues
we anticipate that international operations will continue to account for a
significant portion of our consolidated net revenues risks inherent in our
international operations include the following unexpected changes in regulatory
practices and tariffs difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations
longer collection cycles for accounts receivable potential changes in tax laws
greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property and the impact of
fluctuating exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in
markets where we do business

   our risk management strategy uses derivative financial instruments in the
form of foreign currency option contracts and forward contracts for the
purpose of hedging foreign currency market exposures which exist as a part of
our ongoing business operations our international results may also be
impacted by general economic and political conditions in these foreign
markets these and other factors may adversely impact our future international
operations and consequently our business as a whole

if we do not maintain our relationship with the members of our distribution
channel our ability to generate net revenues will be adversely affected
we sell our software products primarily to distributors and valueadded
resellers or vars our ability to effectively distribute our products depends
in part upon the financial and business condition of our var network although
we have not recently experienced any material problems with the financial
viability of our var network computer software dealers and distributors are
typically not highly capitalized have previously experienced difficulties
during times of economic contraction and may do so in the future in addition
the changing distribution models resulting from the internet from increased
focus on direct sales to major accounts or from twotiered distribution may
impact our var network in the future while no single customer accounted for
more than 10 percent of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal 2001 the loss
of or a significant reduction in business with any one of our major
international distributors or large us resellers could harm our business

product returns by vars could exceed our estimates and harm our net revenues
with the exception of some distributors agreements with our vars do not contain
specific productreturn privileges however we permit our vars to return
product in certain instances generally during periods of product transition and
during update cycles we anticipate that product returns in future periods will
continue to be impacted by product update cycles new product releases and
software quality

   we establish reserves including reserves for stock balancing and product
rotation these reserves are based on estimated future returns of product and
after taking into account channel inventory levels the timing of new product
introductions and other factors while we maintain strict measures to monitor
channel inventories and to provide appropriate reserves actual product
returns may differ from our reserve estimates and such differences could harm
our business

if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights our business
could be harmed
we rely on a combination of patents copyright and trademark laws trade
secrets confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our
proprietary rights despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights
unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software
products or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary
policing unauthorized use of our software products is timeconsuming and costly
while we have recovered some revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of our
software products we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our
software
                                     18
page

products exists and software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem
furthermore our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate
and our competitors may independently develop similar technology

we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to
defend and result in our loss of significant rights
we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to
infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry
segments grows and as the functionality of products in different industry
segments overlaps infringement invalidity claims or misappropriation claims
may be asserted against us and any such assertions could harm our business any
such claims whether with or without merit could be timeconsuming result in
costly litigation and diversion of resources cause product shipment delays or
require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in addition such
royalty or license agreements if required may not be available on acceptable
terms if at all which would likely harm our business

we rely on third party technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate
these technologies our product and service development may be delayed
we rely on certain software that we license from third parties including
software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our
products to perform key functions these thirdparty software licenses may not
continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and the software may
not be appropriately supported maintained or enhanced by the licensors the
loss of licenses to or inability to support maintain and enhance any such
software could result in increased costs or in delays or reductions in product
shipments until equivalent software could be developed identified licensed and
integrated which could harm our business

the loss of key personnel or the inability to attract and retain additional
personnel particularly in northern california where we are headquartered could
harm our business
our continued growth and success depends significantly on the continued service
of highly skilled employees competition for these employees in todays
marketplace especially in the technology industries is intense our ability to
attract and retain employees is dependent on a number of factors including our
continued ability to grant stock incentive awards the loss of key employees or
inability to recruit new employees would negatively impact our business in
addition we may experience increased compensation costs to attract and retain
skilled personnel

the transition to a single european currency could negatively impact our
international operations
as a result of the introduction of the euro and during the transition period
which will end on january 1 2002 we will continue to modify the internal
systems that will be affected by this conversion we may not be able to complete
such modifications to comply with euro requirements which could harm our
business we are currently evaluating the impact of the introduction of the euro
on our foreign exchange activities functional currency designations and
pricing strategies in the new economic environment in addition we face risks
to the extent that banks and vendors upon whom we rely and their suppliers are
unable to make appropriate modifications to support our operations with respect
to euro transactions

our business could suffer as a result of risks associated with strategic
acquisitions and investments
we periodically acquire or invest in businesses software products and
technologies that are complementary to our business through strategic alliances
debt and equity investments and the like the risks associated with such
acquisitions or investments include among others the difficulty of
assimilating the operations and personnel of the companies the failure to
realize anticipated synergies and the diversion of managements time and
attention in addition such investments and acquisitions may involve
significant transactionrelated costs we may not be successful in overcoming
such risks and such investments and acquisitions may negatively impact our
business in addition such investments and acquisitions may contribute to
potential fluctuations in quarterly results of operations the fluctuations
could arise from mergerrelated costs and charges associated with eliminating
redundant expenses or writeoffs of impaired assets recorded in connection with
acquisitions these costs or charges could negatively impact results of
operations for a given period or cause lack of a consistent increase quarter to
quarter in our operating results and financial condition

   we periodically make investments in related entities such as buzzsawcom
and redspark which typically do not expect to earn significant revenues in
the initial period of operations and which incur considerable startup costs
such investments may negatively impact our results of operations and financial
condition

fluctuations in the price of our common stock due to net revenues or earnings
shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price
of our stock to decline which could harm our business the market price for our
common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and

                                     19
page

may continue to fluctuate significantly
the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors
including the following net revenues or earnings shortfalls and changes in
estimates or recommendations by securities analysts the announcement of new
products or product enhancements by us or our competitors quarterly variations
in our or our competitors results of operations developments in our industry
and general market conditions and other factors including factors unrelated to
our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors

   in addition stock prices for many companies in the technology sector have
experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating
performance of such companies after periods of volatility in the market price
of a particular companys securities securities class action litigation has
often been brought against that company we are currently involved in this
type of litigation and may become involved in this type of litigation in the
future this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts managements
attention and resources which could adversely affect our financial condition
or results of operations such factors and fluctuations as well as general
economic political and market conditions may cause the market price of our
common stock to decline which could harm our business

general economic conditions may reduce our net revenues and harm our
business
as our business has grown we have become increasingly subject to the risks
arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions because
of the recent economic slowdown in the us many industries are delaying or
reducing technology purchases the impact of this slowdown on us is difficult to
predict but it may result in reductions in sales of our products longer sales
cycles and increased price competition as a result if the current economic
slowdown continues or worsens we may fall short of our revenue expectations for
any given quarter in fiscal 2002 or for the entire year these conditions would
negatively affect our business and results of operations in addition weakness
in the enduser market could negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors
and vars who could in turn delay paying their obligations to us this would
increase our credit risk exposure which could harm our profitability and
financial condition

business interruptions could adversely affect our business
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire earthquake power loss
telecommunications failure and other events beyond our control our facilities
in northern california are currently subject to electrical blackouts as a
consequence of a shortage of available electrical power in the event these
blackouts continue or increase in severity they could disrupt the operations of
our affected facilities in connection with the shortage of available power
prices for electricity have risen dramatically and will likely continue to
increase for the foreseeable future such price changes will increase our
operating costs which could in turn hurt our profitability



item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk

foreign currency exchange risk

   our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in
foreign currency exchange rates our risk management strategy utilizes foreign
currency forward and option contracts to manage our exposures of underlying
assets liabilities and other obligations which exist as part of our ongoing
business operations contracts are primarily denominated in euro swiss
francs canadian dollars british pounds and japanese yen we do not enter
into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative
purposes

   a sensitivity analysis was performed on our hedging portfolio as of january
31 2001 this analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10 percent appreciation
of the us dollar from january 31 2001 would increase the fair value of our
forward exchangeoption contracts by 70 million conversely a hypothetical
10 percent depreciation of the dollar from january 31 2001 would decrease the
fair value of our forward exchangeoption contracts by 61 million we do not
anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position
results of operations or cash flows as a result of these foreign currency
forward and option contracts

interest rate sensitivity

   we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities including those
classified as security deposits of 3061 million at january 31 2001 these
securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations and will decrease in
market value if interest rates increase

   a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of
january 31 2001 this sensitivity analysis is based on a modeling technique
that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a
parallel shift in the yield curve of plus 50 plus 100 or plus 150 basis
points over 6month and 12month time horizons for the 6month time horizon
the market value changes for a 50 100 or 150 basis point increase were
17 million 34 million and 51 million respectively for the 12
month time horizon the market value changes for a 50 100 or 150 basis point
increase were 14 million 28 million and 41 million respectively

   we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio
to manage interest rate risk we place our investments in instruments that
meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy
guidelines which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue
issuer or type of instrument

investments in privatelyheld businesses

   we have an investment portfolio with a net book value of approximately 70
million as of january 31 2001 that includes minority equity investments in
several privatelyheld technology companies many of which are in the startup
or development stage with the exception of our investments in buzzsaw and
redspark we account for these minority equity investments using the cost method
of accounting these investments are inherently risky because the markets for
the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the
early stages and may never develop into commercially viable businesses we may
incur losses related to our investments in these companies
