international 

we have significant operations outside of the united states “us” which are managed through the same business segments as our us operations – proprietary products and contractmanufactured products sales outside of the us accounted for 577 of our consolidated net sales in 2021 

although the general business processes are similar to the domestic business international operations are exposed to additional risks these risks include currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar “usd” multiple tax jurisdictions and particularly in south america eastern europe israel and the middle east uncertain or changing regulatory regimes or political and social issues that could destabilize local markets and affect the demand for our products 

see further discussion of our international operations the risks associated with our international operations and our attempt to minimize some of these risks in part i item 1a risk factors  part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resources part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  note 1 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies under the captions financial instruments and foreign currency translation and note 11 derivative financial instruments  

raw materials 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers aluminum and plastic elastomers include both synthetic and natural materials we currently have access to adequate supplies of these raw materials to meet our production needs through agreements with suppliers 

we employ a supply chain management strategy in our business segments which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply due to regulatory control over our production processes sole source availability and the cost and time involved in qualifying suppliers we rely on singlesource suppliers for many critical raw materials we generally purchase certain raw materials in the open market this strategy increases the risk that our supply chain may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production or distribution problem these risks are managed when and where possible by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites rigorous quality control systems surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in case of an interruption in production or distribution 

intellectual property 

intellectual property including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets is important to our business we own or license intellectual property rights including knowhow and issued patents and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries that relate to various aspects of our products in 2021 more than 200 patents were issued to west across the globe some key valueadded and proprietary products and processes are exclusively licensed from daikyo our intellectual property rights help protect our products and are critical to the growth of our business 

working capital 

we are required to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet customer requirements in addition some of our supply agreements require us to purchase inventory in bulk orders which increases inventory levels but decreases the risk of supply interruption for a more detailed discussion of working capital please refer to the discussion in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resource s 

government regulation 

our business activities are global and are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws rules and regulations accordingly the design development manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our products and our customers’ products that incorporate our products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the us europe and other countries including the us food and drug administration “fda” the european medicines agency and the national medical products administration china regulatory authorities including regulatory review and oversight can impact the time and cost associated with the development and continued availability of our products and they have the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against west such as product recalls 

changes in tax policy or trade regulations or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations compliance with these laws rules and regulations did not require material capital expenditures in 2021 and is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures results of operations and competitive position in 2022 as compared to prior periods for more information on the potential impacts of government regulations affecting our business see item 1a  risk factors  there were no required material capital expenditures for adherence to our governmentled regulatory standards in our facilities in 2021 outside the normal course of business and there are currently no needed or planned material expenditures for 2022 

west is also subject to various federal and state laws and laws outside the united states concerning fraud and abuse global anticorruption and export control with the recent increased regulations we remain committed as a company to comply with all laws and regulations applicable to our business 

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various national state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows there were no required material capital expenditures for environmental controls in our facilities in 2021 and there are currently no needed or planned material expenditures for 2022 

marketing 

our proprietary products customers primarily include many of the major biologic generic and pharmaceutical drug companies in the world which incorporate our components and other offerings into their injectable products for distribution to the point of care and ultimate enduser the patient 

our contractmanufactured products customers include many of the world’s largest pharmaceutical diagnostic and medical device companies contractmanufactured products components generally are incorporated into our customers’ manufacturing lines for further processing or assembly 

our products and services are sold and distributed primarily through our own sales force and distribution network with limited use of contract sales agents and regional distributors 

our ten largest customers accounted for 414 of our consolidated net sales in 2021 but none of these customers individually accounted for more than 10 of consolidated net sales please refer to note 3 revenue  and note 19 segment information  for additional information on our consolidated net sales 

competition 

with our range of proprietary technologies we compete with several companies across our proprietary products product lines competition for these components is based primarily on product design and performance quality regulatory and scientific expertise along with total cost 

in addition there are a number of competitors supplying medical devices and medical device components including a number of pharmaceutical manufacturers who are also potential customers of our medical devices and components we compete in this market on the basis of our reputation for quality and reliability in engineering and project management as well as our knowledge of and experience in compliance with regulatory requirements 

we have specialized knowledge of container closure components which is integral to developing delivery systems with our range of proprietary technologies we compete with new and established companies in the area of drug delivery devices including suppliers of prefillable syringes autoinjectors safety needles and other proprietary systems 

we seek to differentiate ourselves from our competition by serving as an integrated drug containment and delivery systems global supplier that can provide preapproval primary packaging support and engineering development analytical lab services and integrated solutions regulatory expertise and aftersale technical support customers also appreciate the global scope of our manufacturing capability and our ability to produce many products at multiple sites 

our contractmanufactured products business operates in very competitive markets for its products the competition varies from smaller regional companies to large global assembly manufacturers given the cost pressures they face many of our customers look to reduce costs by sourcing from lowcost locations we seek to differentiate ourselves by leveraging our global capabilities and by employing new technologies such as highspeed automated assembly insertmolding multishot precision molding and expertise with multiplepiece closure systems 

research and development activities 

we maintain our own researchscale production facilities and laboratories for developing new products and offer contract engineering design and development services to assist customers with new product development our quality control regulatory and laboratory testing capabilities are used to ensure compliance with applicable manufacturing and regulatory standards for primary and secondary pharmaceutical packaging components and delivery systems 

commercial development of our new products and services for medical and pharmaceutical applications commonly requires several years new products that we develop may require separate approval as medical devices and products that are intended to be used in the packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical products are subject to both customer acceptance of our products and regulatory approval of the customer’s products following our development period 

we continue to pursue innovative strategic platforms in prefillable syringes injectable containers advanced injection and safety and administration systems 

we also continue to seek new innovative opportunities for acquisition licensing partnering or development of products services and technologies

global and economic risks 

our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by the ongoing covid19 pandemic and other public health epidemics 

our operations expose us to risks associated with a pandemic or outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population including the covid‑19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets and has resulted in governments around the world implementing stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus including quarantines “shelter in place” and “stay at home” orders travel restrictions business curtailments school closures and other measures notwithstanding our level of continued operations the covid19 pandemic or similar public health concerns in the future may have negative impacts on our operations supply chain transportation networks and customers which may compress our margins including as a result of preventative and precautionary measures that we other businesses and governments are taking the covid19 pandemic is adversely affecting the economies and financial markets of many countries and could result in an economic downturn any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect our business financial condition demand for our products services and contribute to volatile supply and demand conditions affecting prices and volumes in the markets for our products services and raw materials 

in addition the ability of our employees and our suppliers and customers employees to work may be significantly impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to covid19 or as a result of the control measures noted above which may significantly hamper our production throughout the supply chain and constrict distribution channels the extent to which the covid19 pandemic may adversely impact our business depends on future developments which are highly uncertain and unpredictable including the duration of the pandemic variants of the virus and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain or mitigate its effects we are unable to predict the potential future impact that the covid‑19 pandemic will have on our business financial condition or results of operations 

unauthorized access to our or our customers’ information and systems could negatively impact our business 

our systems and networks as well as those of our customers suppliers service providers and banks have and may in the future become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches which in turn could result in the unauthorized release and misuse of confidential or proprietary information about our company our employees or our customers as well as disrupt our operations or damage our facilities or those of third parties additionally our systems are subject to regulation to preserve the privacy of certain data held on those systems we maintain an extensive network of technical security controls policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems in order to address these threats while these measures are designed to prevent detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems certain types of attacks could result in financial or information losses andor reputational harm if we cannot comply with regulations or prevent the unauthorized access release andor corruption of our or our customers’ confidential classified or personally identifiable information our reputation could be damaged andor we could face financial losses we may also be required to incur additional costs to modify or enhance our systems or to try to prevent or remediate any such attacks modifying or enhancing our systems may result in unanticipated or prolonged disruption events which could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 

the current uncertainty in the global economy including the effects of recession or slow economic growth in the us europe and emerging markets in asia and south america may negatively affect our operating results examples of the effects of these global economic challenges include our suppliers’ and our customers’ inability to access the credit markets at commercially reasonable rates reduction in sales due to customers decreasing their inventories in the nearterm or longterm or due to liquidity difficulties reduction in sales due to shortages of materials we purchase from our suppliers reduction in research and development efforts and expenditures by our customers our inability to hedge our currency and raw material risks sufficiently or at commercially reasonable prices insolvency of suppliers or customers inflationary pressures on our supplies or our products and increased expenses due to growing global taxation of corporate profits or revenues or changes in or expirations of a country’s tax laws or regulations our operating results in one or more geographic regions may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region if economic and market conditions in the us or europe or in emerging markets weaken further we may experience material adverse impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are a global company with significant revenues and earnings generated internationally which exposes us to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations as well as political and economic risks 

a significant portion of our revenues and earnings are generated internationally sales outside of the us accounted for 577 of our consolidated net sales in 2021 and we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales in the future in addition many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the us and we intend to continue our expansion into emerging andor fastergrowing international markets 

the functional currency for most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency as a result fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect the results of our operations and the value of our foreign assets and liabilities which in turn may adversely affect results of operations and cash flows and the comparability of periodtoperiod results of operations foreign governmental policies and actions regarding currency valuation could result in actions by the united states and other countries to offset the effects of such fluctuations given the unpredictability and volatility of foreign currency exchange rates ongoing or unusual volatility may adversely impact our business and financial conditions 

in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we have entered and expect to continue to enter into hedging arrangements including the use of financial derivatives there can be no certainty that we will be able to enter into or maintain hedges of these currency risks or that our hedges will be effective which could have a significant effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we are exposed to credit risk on accounts receivable and certain prepayments made in the normal course of business this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

a substantial majority of our outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance in addition we have made prepayments associated with insurance premiums and other advances in the normal course of business while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on trade receivables and other current assets there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk and avoid losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

libor reform may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our variablerate debt which includes our senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility agreement dated as of march 28 2019 the “credit agreement” and its accompanying incremental facility amendment dated as of december 30 2019 the “term loan” currently use the london interbank offered rate libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate libor is currently calculated and published for various currencies and periods by the benchmark’s administrator ice benchmark administration limited iba which is regulated for such purposes by the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority fca on march 5 2021 the iba confirmed that it would cease the publication of the oneweek and twomonth us dollar libor settings immediately following the libor publication on december 31 2021 and the publication of all other us dollar libor settings will cease or be deemed unrepresentative after june 30 2023 

accordingly in the near future libor will cease being a widely used benchmark interest rate the current and any future reforms and other pressures may cause libor to be replaced with a new benchmark or to perform differently than in the past including during the transition period the credit agreement amendment contemplates a procedure for transitioning from libor upon the occurrence of specified events nevertheless the consequences of these market developments cannot be entirely predicted and a transition from libor even if administered consistent with the credit facility’s provisions could increase the cost of our variable rate indebtedness 

no assurance can be given that we will continue to pay or declare dividends 

we have historically paid dividends however there can be no assurance that we will pay or declare dividends in the future the actual declaration and payment of future dividends the amount of any such dividends and the establishment of record and payment dates if any are subject to determination by our board of directors each quarter after its review of our thencurrent strategy applicable debt covenants and financial performance and position among other things our declaration and payment of future dividends is subject to risks and uncertainties including deterioration of our financial performance or position inability to declare a dividend in compliance with applicable laws or debt covenants an increase in our cash needs or decrease in available cash and the business judgment of the board of directors that a declaration of a dividend is not in our best interest 

industry risks 

our sales and profitability are largely dependent on the sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products if the drug products developed by our customers in the future use another delivery system or are reconfigured to require less frequent dosing our sales and profitability could suffer 

our business depends to a substantial extent on customers’ continued sales and development of products that are delivered by injection if i our customers fail to continue to sell develop and deploy injectable products ii our customers reconfigure their drug product or develop new drug products requiring less frequent dosing or iii we are unable to develop new products that assist in the delivery of drugs by alternative methods our sales and profitability may suffer 

if we are unable to provide comparative value advantages timely fulfill customer orders or resist pricing pressure we will have to reduce our prices which may reduce our profit margins 

we compete with several companies across our major product lines because of the special nature of these products competition is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive costcontrol programs across their operations companies often compete on the basis of price we aim to differentiate ourselves from our competition by being a “fullservice valueadded” global supplier that is able to provide presale compatibility studies engineering support and other services and sophisticated postsale technical support on a global basis however we face continued pricing pressure from our customers and competitors if we are unable to resist or offset the effects of continued pricing pressure through our valueadded services improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures or if we have to reduce our prices our sales and profitability may suffer 

consolidation in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries continue to experience a significant amount of consolidation as a result of this consolidation competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased in addition group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has placed pricing pressure on suppliers further consolidation within the industries we serve could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products 

the medical technology industry is very competitive and customer demands andor new products in the marketplace could cause a reduction in demand 

the medical technology industry is subject to rapid technological changes and we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold we face this competition from a wide range of companies including large medical device companies some of which have greater financial and marketing resources than we do we also face competition from firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets in some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for diseases that may be delivered via their own or without a medical device the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology may reduce customer demand for our products or render some of our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive in addition any failure or inability to meet increased customer quality expectations could cause a reduction in demand 

business and operational risks 

disruption in our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make and sell products and have a negative impact on our reputation performance or financial condition 

we have manufacturing sites throughout the world in some instances however the manufacturing of certain product lines is concentrated in one or only a few of our plants the functioning of our manufacturing and distribution assets and systems could be disrupted for reasons either within or beyond our control including without limitation extreme weather or longerterm climatic changes natural disasters pandemic war accidental damage disruption to the supply of material or services product quality and safety issues systems failure workforce actions or environmental matters there is a risk that incident management systems in place may prove inadequate and that any disruption may materially adversely affect our ability to make and sell products and therefore materially adversely affect our reputation performance or financial condition 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that vary by country and which could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

we conduct business in most of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world our international operations and our ability to implement our overall business strategy including our plan to continue expanding into emerging andor fastergrowing markets outside of the us are subject to risks and uncertainties that can vary by country and include transportation delays and interruptions political and economic instability and disruptions including the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union imposition of duties and tariffs import and export controls the risks of divergent business expectations or cultural incompatibility inherent in establishing and maintaining operations in foreign countries difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations labor strikes andor disputes and potentially adverse tax consequences limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies with third parties or our joint venture partners outside of the us could also create exposure in addition we may not be able to operate in compliance with foreign laws and regulations or comply with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject in the event that these laws or regulations change any of these events could have an adverse effect on our international operations in the future by reducing the demand for our products or decreasing the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

disruptions in the supply of key raw materials could adversely impact our operations 

we generally purchase our raw materials and supplies required for the production of our products in the open market for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability or cost effectiveness many components and raw materials are available andor purchased only from a single supplier due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products and the availability of such raw materials we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for these components or raw materials or do so without excessive cost as a result a reduction or interruption in supply or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

raw material and energy prices have a significant impact on our profitability if raw material andor energy prices increase and we cannot pass those price increases on to our customers our profitability and financial condition may suffer 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers which include synthetic and natural material aluminum and plastic in addition our manufacturing facilities consume a wide variety of energy products to fuel heat and cool our operations supply and demand factors which are beyond our control generally affect the price of our raw materials and utility costs if we are unable to pass along increased raw material prices and energy costs to our customers our profitability and thus our financial condition may be adversely affected the prices of many of these raw materials and utilities are cyclical and volatile for example the prices of certain commodities particularly petroleumbased raw materials have in the recent past exhibited rapid changes affecting the cost of synthetic elastomers and plastic while we generally attempt to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of sales price increases historically there has been a time delay between raw material andor energy price increases and our ability to increase the prices of our products in some circumstances we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pressure and other factors 

if we are not timely or successful in newproduct innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems our future revenues and operating income could be adversely affected 

our growth partly depends on newproduct innovation and the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications product development and commercialization is inherently uncertain and is subject to a number of factors outside of our control including any necessary regulatory approvals and commercial acceptance for the products the ultimate timing and successful commercialization of new products and systems requires substantial evaluations of the functional operational clinical and economic viability of our products in addition the timely and adequate availability of filling capacity is essential to both conducting definitive stability trials and the timing of commercialization of customers’ products in crystal zenith vials syringes and cartridges delays interruptions or failures in developing and commercializing newproduct innovations or proprietary multicomponent systems could adversely affect future revenues and operating income in addition adverse conditions may also result in future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we may not succeed in finding and completing acquisitions or other strategic transactions which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we have historically engaged in acquisition activity and we may in the future engage in acquisitions or other strategic transactions such as joint ventures or investments in other entities we may be unable to identify suitable targets opportunistic or otherwise for acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future if we identify a suitable candidate our ability to successfully implement the strategic transaction would depend on a variety of factors including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and to comply with the restrictions contained in our debt agreements strategic transactions involve risks including those associated with integrating the operations or maintaining the operations as separate as applicable financial reporting disparate technologies and personnel of acquired companies joint ventures or related companies managing geographically dispersed operations or other strategic investments the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience the potential loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies joint ventures or companies in which we may make strategic investments and potentially other unknown risks we may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire or strategically develop in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits relating to any such strategic transactions strategic transactions may be expensive time consuming and may strain our resources strategic transactions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of among other things the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill additional carrying costs of patent or trademark portfolios and amortization expenses of other intangible assets in addition strategic transactions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities 

product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 

the design manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical packaging and medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects unanticipated use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market a recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals please refer to note 3 revenue  for the discussion of the voluntary recall of our vial2bag ® product line 

a loss of key personnel or highly skilled employees could disrupt our operations 

our future success depends in large part on our ability to retain key employees including our executive officers and individuals in technical marketing sales and research positions competition for experienced employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees our business could be adversely affected although we believe that we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise our inability to do so on a timely basis could disrupt the operations of the unit affected or our overall operations in addition because of the complex nature of many of our products and programs we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled engineering staff and workforce our operations could be disrupted by a shortage of available skilled employees 

our results of operations and earnings may not meet guidance or expectations  

we provide public guidance on our expected results of operations for future periods this guidance is comprised of forwardlooking statements subject to risks and uncertainties including the risks and uncertainties described in this form 10k and in our other public filings and public statements and is based on assumptions we make at the time we provide such guidance our guidance may not always be accurate if in the future our results of operations for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or if we reduce our guidance for future periods the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 

if we fail to comply with our obligations under our distributorship or license agreements with daikyo or the agreements are terminated early or not renewed we could lose license rights and access to certain product and technology that are important to our business 

key valueadded and proprietary products and processes are licensed from our affiliate daikyo including but not limited to crystal zenith flurotec ® and b2coating technologies our rights to these products and processes are licensed pursuant to agreements that expire in 2027 however if the agreements are terminated early or not renewed our business could be adversely impacted please refer to note 7 affiliated companies  for information relating to the increase in our ownership interest in daikyo in 2019 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to regulation by governments around the world and if these regulations are not complied with existing and future operations may be curtailed and we could be subject to liability 

as a multinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world we are subject to and must comply with extensive laws and regulations in the united states and other jurisdictions in which we have operations and distribution channels for example the design development manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our products and our customers’ products that incorporate our products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the us europe and other countries including the fda the european medicines agency and the national medical products administration china complying with governmental regulation can be costly and can result in required modification or withdrawal of existing products and a substantial delay in the introduction of new products failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or failure to obtain regulatory approval for a new product could subject us to fines sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

the global nature of our business also means legal and compliance risks such as antibribery anticorruption fraud trade environmental competition privacy and other regulatory matters will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time which could adversely affect us in addition the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations may result in significant unanticipated legal and reputational risks any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert managements attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees 

products that incorporate our technologies and medical devices that we produce are subject to regulations and extensive approval or clearance processes which make the timing and success of newproduct commercialization difficult to predict 

the process of obtaining and maintaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is expensive and timeconsuming historically most medical devices that incorporate our technologies and medical devices that we produce have been subject to the fda’s 510k marketing approval process which typically lasts from six to nine months supplemental or full premarket approval reviews require a significantly longer period delaying commercialization changes in regulation on a global scale must be monitored and actions taken to ensure ongoing compliance pharmaceutical products that incorporate our technologies and medical devices that we produce are subject to the fda’s new drug application process which typically takes a number of years to complete additionally biotechnology products that incorporate our technologies and medical devices that we produce are subject to the fda’s biologics license application process which also typically takes a number of years to complete outside of the us sales of medical devices and pharmaceutical or biotechnology products are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary from country to country the time required to obtain approval for sale internationally may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval there is no certainty that any regulatory approval may be obtained or maintained indefinitely and our ability to launch products to the market and maintain market presence is not guaranteed 

changes in the regulation of drug products and devices may increase competitive pressure and adversely affect our business 

an effect of the governmental regulation of our medical devices and our customers’ drug products devices and manufacturing processes is that compliance with regulations makes it difficult to change components and devices produced by one supplier with those from another supplier due to the large amount of data and information that customers must generate to demonstrate that the components and devices are equivalent and pose no additional risk to the patient the regulation of our medical devices and our customers’ products that incorporate our components and devices has increased over time if the applicable regulations were to be modified in a way that reduced the level of data and information needed to prove equivalency for a change from one supplier’s components or devices to those made by another it is likely that the competitive pressure would increase and adversely affect our sales and profitability 

if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights our ability to compete may be affected 

our patents trademarks and other intellectual property are important to our business we rely on patent trademark copyright trade secret and other intellectual property laws as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary products information technologies and processes we also have obligations with respect to the nonuse and nondisclosure of thirdparty intellectual property we may need to engage in litigation or similar activities to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others any such litigation could require us to expend significant resources and divert the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel from our business operations there can be no assurance that the steps we will take to prevent misappropriation infringement or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of others will be successful in addition effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for some of our proprietary products in some countries failure to protect our intellectual property or successfully invalidate or defend against intellectual property protections of third parties could harm our business and results of operations in addition if relevant and effective patent protection is not available or has expired we may not be able to prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar or duplicative to ours 

significant developments in us policies could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

we earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and as such we are subject to the tax laws in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application in any jurisdiction subject to significant change 

proposals to reform us and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings and could increase the us corporate tax rate although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals may pass several of the proposals considered if enacted into law could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate income tax expense and cash flows 

we utilize tax rulings and other agreements to obtain certainty in treatment of certain tax matters these rulings and agreements expire from time to time and may be extended when certain conditions are met or terminated if certain conditions are not met the impact of any changes in conditions would be the loss of certainty in treatment thus potentially impacting our effective income tax rate 

we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the united states internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes although we believe our tax provisions are adequate the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made for example we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates 

we are subject to stringent and changing obligations related to data privacy and security our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to regulatory investigations or actions litigation fines and penalties disruptions of our business operations reputational harm and other adverse business consequences 

in addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information we handle transactional and personal information worldwide as a result we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous and sometimes conflicting laws regulatory standards industry standards external and internal privacy and security policies contracts and other obligations that govern the processing of business and personal data by us and on our behalf for example the european union’s general data protection regulation the “eu gdpr” the united kingdom’s gdpr the “uk gdpr” and california’s consumer privacy act of 2018 as amended the ccpa impose obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provide certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored in addition it is anticipated that the california privacy rights act of 2020 “cpra” effective january 1 2023 will expand the ccpa furthermore other states in the united states have enacted data privacy laws for example virginia passed the consumer data protection act and colorado passed the colorado privacy act both of which become effective in 2023 additionally laws in certain jurisdictions require data localization and impose restrictions on the transfer of personal information across border for example the eu gdpr generally restricts the transfer of personal information to countries outside of the european economic area without appropriate safeguards or other measures if we cannot implement a valid compliance mechanism for crossborder privacy and security transfers we may face increased exposure to regulatory actions substantial fines and injunctions against processing or transferring personal information from europe or elsewhere 

compliance with existing and forthcoming laws and regulations can be costly and time consuming and may require changes to our information technologies systems and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal information on our behalf if we fail or are perceived to have failed to address or comply with obligations related to data privacy and security we could face significant consequences including but not limited to proceedings against the company by governmental entities eg investigations fines penalties audits inspections or other entities or individuals additional reporting requirements andor oversight bans damage to our reputation and credibility or inability to process data or operate in certain jurisdictions any of which could have a negative impact on revenues and profits 

failure to comply with antibribery anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences 

we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa the uk bribery act and other antibribery anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws in various jurisdictions around the world the fcpa the uk bribery act and similar applicable laws generally prohibit companies as well as their officers directors employees and thirdparty intermediaries business partners and agents from making improper payments or providing other improper things of value to government officials or other persons we and our thirdparty intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state owned or affiliated entities and other third parties where we may be held liable for corrupt or other illegal activities even if we do not explicitly authorize them while we have policies and procedures and internal controls to address compliance with such laws we cannot provide assurance that all of our employees and thirdparty intermediaries business partners and agents will not take actions in violation of such policies and laws for which we may be ultimately held responsible to the extent that we learn that any of our employees or thirdparty intermediaries business partners or agents do not adhere to our policies procedures or internal controls we are committed to taking appropriate remedial action in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our directors officers employees or thirdparty intermediaries agents or business partners have or may have violated such laws we may be required to investigate or to have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances detecting investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations can be extensive and require a significant diversion of time resources and attention from senior management any violation of the fcpa the uk bribery act or other applicable antibribery anticorruption and antimoney laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints adverse media coverage investigations loss of export privileges and criminal or civil sanctions penalties and fines any of which may could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

our operations must comply with environmental statutes and regulations and any failure to comply could result in extensive costs which would harm our business 

the manufacturing of some of our products has involved and may continue to involve the use transportation storage and disposal of hazardous or toxic materials and is subject to various environmental protection and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate this has exposed us in the past and could expose us in the future to risks of accidental contamination and events of noncompliance with environmental laws any such occurrences could result in regulatory enforcement or personal injury and property damage claims or could lead to a shutdown of some of our operations which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations we currently incur costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations and these costs may become more significant 

healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in the us or international healthcare systems could result in reduced demand for our products as our sales depend in part on the extent to which pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities private insurers and other thirdparty payers for the costs of our products the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers which can vary among public and private sources may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these products in a particular jurisdiction legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the us or abroad for example those under consideration in france germany italy and the united kingdom could significantly reduce reimbursement for our customers’ products which could in turn reduce the demand for our products 

moreover in the coming years additional changes could be made to global governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our products we will continue to evaluate healthcare reform as well as trends and changes that may be encouraged by healthcare legislation globally and that may potentially impact our business over time 

the uncertain effects of climate change and potential climate change legislation could lead to business interruption significantly increased costs andor other adverse consequences to our business 

climate change and potential climate change legislation may present risks to our operations including business interruption significantly increased costs andor other adverse consequences to our business some of the potential impacts of climate change to our business include physical risks to our facilities water and energy supply limitations or interruptions disruptions to our supply chain and impairment of other resources in addition if legislation or regulations are enacted or promulgated in the us europe asia or any other jurisdictions in which we do business that limit or reduce allowable greenhouse gas emissions and other emissions such restrictions could have a significant effect on our operating and financial decisions including those involving capital expenditures to reduce emissions and our results of operations our manufacturing operations may not be able to operate as planned if we are not able to comply with new legal and regulatory legislation around climate change or it may become too costly to operate in a profitable manner additionally suppliers’ added expenses could be passed on to us in the form of higher prices and we may not be able to pass on such expenses to our customers through price increases

liquidity and capital resources 

the table below presents selected liquidity and capital measures as of 



cash and cash equivalents include all instruments that have maturities of ninety days or less when purchased working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities 

cash and cash equivalents – our cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2021 consisted of cash held in depository accounts with banks around the world and cash invested in highquality shortterm investments the cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2021 included 4220 million of cash held by subsidiaries within the us and 3406 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the us in response to the 2017 tax act we reevaluated our position regarding permanent reinvestment of foreign subsidiary earnings and profits through 2017 with the exception of china and mexico and decided that those profits were no longer permanently reinvested as of january 1 2018 we reasserted indefinite reinvestment related to all post2017 unremitted earnings in all of our foreign subsidiaries in general it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and repatriate earnings only when the tax impact is de minimis and that position has not changed subsequent to the onetime transition tax under the 2017 tax act except as noted above accordingly no deferred taxes have been provided for withholding taxes or other taxes that would result upon repatriation of approximately 6353 million of undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries to the us as those earnings continue to be permanently reinvested further it is impracticable for us to estimate any future tax costs for any unrecognized deferred tax liabilities associated with our indefinite reinvestment assertion because the actual tax liability if any would be dependent on complex analysis and calculations considering various tax laws exchange rates circumstances existing when there is a repatriation sale or liquidation or other factors 

working capital  working capital at december 31 2021 increased by 2776 million or 319 as compared to december 31 2020 which includes an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of 133 million excluding the impact of currency exchange rates cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable inventories and total current liabilities increased by 1626 million 1210 million 693 million and 1080 million respectively the increase in accounts receivable was due to increased sales activity the increase in inventories that occurred in the period was to ensure we have sufficient inventory on hand to support the needs of our customers the increase in total current liabilities was primarily due to increases in current debt accounts payable accrued salaries wages and benefits accrued expenses and accrued rebates 

debt and credit facilities  the 22 million decrease in total debt at december 31 2021 as compared to december 31 2020 resulted from debt repayments under our term loan 

our sources of liquidity include our credit facility at december 31 2021 we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility at december 31 2021 the borrowing capacity available under the credit facility including outstanding letters of credit of 24 million was 2976 million we do not expect any significant limitations on our ability to access this source of funds please refer to note 10 debt  for further discussion of our credit facility 

pursuant to the financial covenants in our debt agreements we are required to maintain established interest coverage ratios and to not exceed established leverage ratios in addition the agreements contain other customary covenants none of which we consider restrictive to our operations at december 31 2021 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements throughout 2022 

we believe that cash on hand and cash generated from operations together with availability under our credit facility will be adequate to address our foreseeable liquidity needs based on our current expectations of our business operations capital expenditures and scheduled payments of debt obligations to continue to meet customer demand 

commitments and contractual obligations 

contractual obligations associated with ongoing business activities are expected to result in cash payments in future periods and include the following material items 

• our business creates a need to enter into various commitments with suppliers including for the purchase of raw materials and finished goods in accordance with us gaap these purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2021 our outstanding unconditional contractual commitments including for the purchase of raw materials and finished goods amounted to 936 million of which 483 million is due to be paid in 2022 these purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements and are in the normal course of business the company previously entered into a material supply agreement for butyl polymers used as a principal raw material in a broad range of the company’s polymerbased pharmaceutical packaging products 

• our longterm debt obligations net of unamortized debt issuance costs including fixed and variablerate debt further discussed in note 10 debt  

• our operating leases obligations primarily related to land buildings and machinery and equipment with lease terms through 2047 further discussed in note 6 leases  

critical accounting estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with us gaap the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions some of which are subjective and complex that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our results of operations and financial position 

impairment of longlived assets longlived assets including property plant and equipment and operating lease rightofuse assets are tested for impairment whenever circumstances such as a deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions or a change in company strategy increased competition declining product demand plans to dispose of an asset or asset group or recent financial or legal factors that could impact the expected cash flows indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable an asset is considered impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future expected undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset impairment reviews are based on an estimated future cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to future revenue and expense growth rates selection of appropriate discount rate asset groupings and other assumptions and estimates the company uses estimates that are consistent with its business plans and a market participant view of the assets being evaluated once an asset is considered impaired an impairment loss is recorded within other expense income for the difference between the asset’s carrying value and its fair value for assets held and used in the business management determines fair value using estimated future cash flows to be derived from the asset discounted to a net present value using an appropriate discount rate for assets held for sale or for investment purposes management determines fair value by estimating the proceeds to be received upon sale of the asset less disposition costs 

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually following the completion of our annual budget and longrange planning process or whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is the same as or one level below our operating segments a goodwill impairment charge represents the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test such as future sales future cash flows and longterm growth rates are consistent with internal projections and operating plans amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test are also largely dependent on the continued sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products as well as our timeliness and success in newproduct innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems changes in the estimate of fair value including the estimate of future cash flows could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position accounting guidance also allows entities to first assess qualitative factors including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors and overall financial performance to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test we elected to follow this guidance for our annual impairment test based upon our assessment we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was less than its carrying amount and determined that it was not necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test 

intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 

employee benefits we maintain funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans in the us and a number of other countries that cover employees who meet eligibility requirements in addition we sponsor postretirement benefit plans which provide healthcare benefits for eligible employees who retire or become disabled postretirement benefit plans are limited to only those active employees who met the eligibility requirements as of january 1 2017 the measurement of annual cost and obligations under these defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to a number of assumptions which are specific for each of our us and foreign plans the assumptions which are reviewed at least annually are relevant to both the plan assets where applicable and the obligation for benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees two of the most critical assumptions in determining pension expense are the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement age rates of compensation increases mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience for our funded plans we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our plan assets as well as historical and expected rates of return in estimating the longterm rate of return on plan assets one of the most critical assumptions in determining retiree mental plan expense is the discount rate under us gaap differences between actual and expected results are generally accumulated in other comprehensive income loss as actuarial gains or losses and subsequently amortized into earnings over future periods 

changes in key assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position we estimate that every 25basis point reduction in our longterm rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by 07 million and every 25basis point reduction in our discount rate would decrease pension expense by 00 million a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations our net pension underfunded balance at december 31 2021 was 206 million compared to 408 million at december 31 2020 our underfunded balance for other postretirement benefits was 56 million at december 31 2021 compared to 61 million at december 31 2020 

income taxes we estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation in addition deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates to tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of our assets and liabilities the enacted statutory tax rate applied is based on the rate expected to be applicable at the time of the forecasted utilization of the loss carryforward or reversal of the temporary difference valuation allowances on deferred tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized the realizability of deferred tax assets is subject to our estimates of future taxable income generally at the respective subsidiary company and country level changes in tax legislation business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined 

when accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements we apply a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 

please refer to note 1 basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies and note 2 new accounting standards  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our significant accounting policies and accounting standards issued but not yet adopted 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our ongoing business operations expose us to various risks such as fluctuating interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and increasing commodity prices these risk factors can impact our results of operations cash flows and financial position to manage these market risks we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps options and foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with and for notional amounts equal to or less than the related underlying exposures we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for investment or trading purposes all derivatives are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 

foreign currency exchange risk 

sales outside of the us accounted for 577 of our consolidated net sales in 2021 virtually all of these sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into usd for consolidated reporting purposes although the majority of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary they may also hold assets or liabilities denominated in other currencies these items may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains and losses as a result our results of operations and financial position are exposed to changing currency exchange rates we periodically use forward exchange contracts to hedge certain transactions or to manage monthend balance sheet exposures on crosscurrency intercompany loans 

we have entered into forward exchange contracts designated as fair value hedges to manage our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates on crosscurrency intercompany loans as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 the total amount of these forward exchange contracts were 134 million and sgd 6015 million 

in addition we have entered into several foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges for periods of up to eighteen months intended to hedge the currency risk associated with a portion of our forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies as of december 31 2021 we had outstanding foreign currency contracts to purchase and sell certain pairs of currencies as follows 



in november and december 2019 in conjunction with the repayment of the outstanding longterm borrowings under our credit facility denominated in euro and japanese yen we dedesignated these borrowings as hedges of our net investments in certain european subsidiaries and daikyo the amounts recorded as a cumulative translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to these borrowings prior to dedesignation will remain in accumulated other comprehensive loss indefinitely unless certain future events occur such as the disposition of the operations for which the net investment hedges relate 

in december 2019 we entered into a fiveyear floatingtofloating forwardstarting crosscurrency swap the “crosscurrency swap” for 90 million which we designated as a hedge of our net investment in daikyo the notional amount of the crosscurrency swap is ¥94 billion 855 million as of december 31 2021 under the crosscurrency swap we receive floating interest rate payments based on threemonth usd libor plus a margin in return for paying floating interest rate payments based on threemonth japanese yen libor or successor rate plus a margin 

interest rate risk 

as a result of our normal borrowing activities we have longterm debt with both fixed and variable interest rates longterm debt consists of our term loan and series a b and c notes 

the following table summarizes our interest rate risksensitive instruments 

commodity price risk 

many of our proprietary products are made from synthetic elastomers which are derived from the petroleum refining process we purchase the majority of our elastomers via longterm supply contracts some of which contain clauses that provide for surcharges related to fluctuations in crude oil prices in recent years raw material costs have fluctuated due to crude oil price fluctuations we expect this volatility to continue and will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects on gross profit 

from november 2017 through december 2021 we purchased several series of call options for a total of 640267 barrels of crude oil to mitigate our exposure to such oilbased surcharges and protect operating cash flows with regards to a portion of our forecas ted elastomer purchases 

during 2021 the gain recorded in cost of goods and services sold related to these options was 17 million dur ing 2020 the loss recorded in cost of goods and services sold related to these options was 02 million 

as of december 31 2021 we had outstanding contracts to purchase 188242 barrels of crude oil from january 2022 to june 2023 at a weightedaverage strike price of 7416 per barrel

although the general business processes are similar to the domestic business international operations are exposed to additional risks these risks include currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar “usd” multiple tax jurisdictions and particularly in south america israel and the middle east uncertain or changing regulatory regimes or political and social issues that could destabilize local markets and affect the demand for our products 

see further discussion of our international operations the risks associated with our international operations and our attempt to minimize some of these risks in part i item 1a risk factors  part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resources part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  note 1 under the captions financial instruments and foreign currency translation and note 11 derivative financial instruments  

raw materials 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers aluminum and plastic elastomers include both synthetic and natural materials we currently have access to adequate supplies of these raw materials to meet our production needs through agreements with suppliers 

we employ a supply chain management strategy in our business segments which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply due to regulatory control over our production processes sole source availability and the cost and time involved in qualifying suppliers we rely on singlesource suppliers for many critical raw materials we generally purchase certain raw materials in the open market this strategy increases the risk that our supply chain may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production or distribution problem these risks are managed when and where possible by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites rigorous quality control systems surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in case of an interruption in production or distribution 

intellectual property 

intellectual property including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets is important to our business we own or license intellectual property rights including knowhow and issued patents and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries that relate to various aspects of our products in 2020 more than 290 patents were issued to west across the globe some key valueadded and proprietary products and processes are exclusively licensed from daikyo our intellectual property rights help protect our products and are critical to the growth of our business 

working capital 

we are required to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet customer requirements in addition some of our supply agreements require us to purchase inventory in bulk orders which increases inventory levels but decreases the risk of supply interruption for a more detailed discussion of working capital please refer to the discussion in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resource s 

government regulation 

the design development manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our products and our customers’ products that incorporate our products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the us europe and other countries including the us food and drug administration “fda” the european medicines agency and the national medical products administration china regulatory authorities including regulatory review and oversight can impact the time and cost associated with the development and continued availability of our products and they have the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against west such as product recalls there were no required material capital expenditures for adherence to our governmentled regulatory standards in our facilities in 2020 outside the normal course of business and there are currently no needed or planned material expenditures for 2021 

west is also subject to various federal and state laws and laws outside the united states concerning fraud and abuse global anticorruption and export control with the recent increased regulations we remain committed as a company to comply with all laws and regulations applicable to our business 

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various national state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows there were no required material capital expenditures for environmental controls in our facilities in 2020 and there are currently no needed or planned material expenditures for 2021 

marketing 

our proprietary products customers primarily include many of the major biologic generic and pharmaceutical drug companies in the world which incorporate our components and other offerings into their injectable products for distribution to the point of care and ultimate enduser  the patient 

our contractmanufactured products customers include many of the world’s largest pharmaceutical diagnostic and medical device companies contractmanufactured products components generally are incorporated into our customers’ manufacturing lines for further processing or assembly 

our products and services are sold and distributed primarily through our own sales force and distribution network with limited use of contract sales agents and regional distributors 

our ten largest customers accounted for 420 of our consolidated net sales in 2020 but none of these customers individually accounted for more than 10 of consolidated net sales please refer to note 3 revenue  and note 19 segment information  for additional information on our consolidated net sales 

competition 

with our range of proprietary technologies we compete with several companies across our proprietary products product lines competition for these components is based primarily on product design and performance quality regulatory and scientific expertise along with total cost 

in addition there are a number of competitors supplying medical devices and medical device components including a number of pharmaceutical manufacturers who are also potential customers of our medical devices and components we compete in this market on the basis of our reputation for quality and reliability in engineering and project management as well as our knowledge of and experience in compliance with regulatory requirements 

we have specialized knowledge of container closure components which is integral to developing delivery systems with our range of proprietary technologies we compete with new and established companies in the area of drug delivery devices including suppliers of prefillable syringes autoinjectors safety needles and other proprietary systems 

we seek to differentiate ourselves from our competition by serving as an integrated drug containment and delivery systems global supplier that can provide preapproval primary packaging support and engineering development analytical lab services and integrated solutions regulatory expertise and aftersale technical support customers also appreciate the global scope of our manufacturing capability and our ability to produce many products at multiple sites 

our contractmanufactured products business operates in very competitive markets for its products the competition varies from smaller regional companies to large global assembly manufacturers given the cost pressures they face many of our customers look to reduce costs by sourcing from lowcost locations we seek to differentiate ourselves by leveraging our global capabilities and by employing new technologies such as highspeed automated assembly insertmolding multishot precision molding and expertise with multiplepiece closure systems 

research and development activities 

we maintain our own researchscale production facilities and laboratories for developing new products and offer contract engineering design and development services to assist customers with new product development our quality control regulatory and laboratory testing capabilities are used to ensure compliance with applicable manufacturing and regulatory standards for primary and secondary pharmaceutical packaging components and delivery systems 

commercial development of our new products and services for medical and pharmaceutical applications commonly requires several years new products that we develop may require separate approval as medical devices and products that are intended to be used in the packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical products are subject to both customer acceptance of our products and regulatory approval of the customer’s products following our development period 

we continue to pursue innovative strategic platforms in prefillable syringes injectable containers advanced injection and safety and administration systems 

we also continue to seek new innovative opportunities for acquisition licensing partnering or development of products services and technologies

global and economic risks 

our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic and other public health epidemics 

our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if the progression of the covid19 pandemic interferes with our ability or that of our employees contractors suppliers customers and other business partners to carry out and deliver on business obligations 

covid19 may have an adverse effect on our operations supply chains and distribution systems known potential impacts are illness in our workforce as well as a reduction in access to raw materials for production and access to transportation of product there could be other unknown and unforeseeable impacts these impacts have increased and may continue to increase our expenses including costs associated with preventive and precautionary measures that we companies with which we conduct business and governments are taking government measures include actions that restrict or prohibit travel which in turn may impact our operations by limiting our employees’ ability to come to work or the employees of companies upon which our supply chain depends the impacts of the pandemic and the aforesaid measures taken by other companies and governments may cause us to experience significant and unpredictable reductions or increases in demand for certain of our products this is especially possible in the event customers reprioritize their needs due to the changing environment 

despite our efforts to manage these covid19 related risks their ultimate impact on the company will be determined by factors beyond our knowledge or control including the duration of covid19 and further actions taken to control its spread and mitigate its public health effects 

unauthorized access to our or our customers’ information and systems could negatively impact our business 

our systems and networks as well as those of our customers suppliers service providers and banks have and may in the future become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches which in turn could result in the unauthorized release and misuse of confidential or proprietary information about our company our employees or our customers as well as disrupt our operations or damage our facilities or those of third parties additionally our systems are subject to regulation to preserve the privacy of certain data held on those systems we maintain an extensive network of technical security controls policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems in order to address these threats while these measures are designed to prevent detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems certain types of attacks could result in financial or information losses andor reputational harm if we cannot comply with regulations or prevent the unauthorized access release andor corruption of our or our customers’ confidential classified or personally identifiable information our reputation could be damaged andor we could face financial losses we may also be required to incur additional costs to modify or enhance our systems or to try to prevent or remediate any such attacks modifying or enhancing our systems may result in unanticipated or prolonged disruption events which could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 

the current uncertainty in the global economy including the effects of recession or slow economic growth in the us europe and emerging markets in asia and south america may negatively affect our operating results examples of the effects of these global economic challenges include our suppliers’ and our customers’ inability to access the credit markets at commercially reasonable rates reduction in sales due to customers decreasing their inventories in the nearterm or longterm or due to liquidity difficulties reduction in sales due to shortages of materials we purchase from our suppliers reduction in research and development efforts and expenditures by our customers our inability to hedge our currency and raw material risks sufficiently or at commercially reasonable prices insolvency of suppliers or customers inflationary pressures on our supplies or our products and increased expenses due to growing global taxation of corporate profits or revenues or changes in or expirations of a country’s tax laws or regulations our operating results in one or more geographic regions may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region if economic and market conditions in the us or europe or in emerging markets weaken further we may experience material adverse impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

our business is subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations sales outside of the us accounted for 546 of our consolidated net sales in 2020 and we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales in the future in addition many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the us further we intend to continue our expansion into emerging andor fastergrowing markets outside of the us in the future virtually all of our international sales assets and related operating costs and expenses are earned valued or incurred in the currency of the local country primarily the euro the singapore dollar “sgd” and the danish krone in addition we are exposed to japanese yen “yen” as we maintain a 49 ownership interest in and we purchase finished goods and other materials from daikyo we are also exposed to currencies in emerging market countries such as the chinese yuan the indian rupee the south korean won and various south american currencies our consolidated financial statements are presented in usd and therefore we must translate the reported values of our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses into usd which can result in significant fluctuations in the amount of those assets liabilities revenues or expenses the exchange rates between these foreign currencies and usd in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future increases or decreases in the value of usd compared to these foreign currencies may negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

in addition to translation risks we incur currency transaction risk when we or one of our subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction in a currency other than that entity’s local currency in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in certain exchange rates we have entered and expect to continue to enter into hedging arrangements including the use of financial derivatives there can be no certainty that we will be able to enter into or maintain hedges of these currency risks or that our hedges will be effective which could have a significant effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we are exposed to credit risk on accounts receivable and certain prepayments made in the normal course of business this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

a substantial majority of our outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance in addition we have made prepayments associated with insurance premiums and other advances in the normal course of business while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on trade receivables and other current assets there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk and avoid losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

libor reform may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our variablerate debt which includes our senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility agreement dated as of march 28 2019 the “credit agreement” and its accompanying incremental facility amendment dated as of december 30 2019 the “term loan” currently use the london interbank offered rate libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate libor is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform in july 2017 the uk financial conduct authority the fca which regulates libor announced that the fca will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 such announcement indicates that the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021 if the method for calculation of libor changes if libor is no longer available or if lenders have increased costs due to changes in libor we may suffer from potential increases in interest rates on our variablerate debt which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows further we may need to amend our credit agreement and term loan in connection with the replacement of libor with the new standard that is established we will continue to monitor the proposals for reform relating to libor 

no assurance can be given that we will continue to pay or declare dividends 

we have historically paid dividends however there can be no assurance that we will pay or declare dividends in the future the actual declaration and payment of future dividends the amount of any such dividends and the establishment of record and payment dates if any are subject to determination by our board of directors each quarter after its review of our thencurrent strategy applicable debt covenants and financial performance and position among other things our declaration and payment of future dividends is subject to risks and uncertainties including deterioration of our financial performance or position inability to declare a dividend in compliance with applicable laws or debt covenants an increase in our cash needs or decrease in available cash and the business judgment of the board of directors that a declaration of a dividend is not in our best interest 

industry risks 

our sales and profitability are largely dependent on the sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products if the drug products developed by our customers in the future use another delivery system or are reconfigured to require less frequent dosing our sales and profitability could suffer 

our business depends to a substantial extent on customers’ continued sales and development of products that are delivered by injection if i our customers fail to continue to sell develop and deploy injectable products ii our customers reconfigure their drug product or develop new drug products requiring less frequent dosing or iii we are unable to develop new products that assist in the delivery of drugs by alternative methods our sales and profitability may suffer 

if we are unable to provide comparative value advantages timely fulfill customer orders or resist pricing pressure we will have to reduce our prices which may reduce our profit margins 

we compete with several companies across our major product lines because of the special nature of these products competition is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive costcontrol programs across their operations companies often compete on the basis of price we aim to differentiate ourselves from our competition by being a “fullservice valueadded” global supplier that is able to provide presale compatibility studies engineering support and other services and sophisticated postsale technical support on a global basis however we face continued pricing pressure from our customers and competitors if we are unable to resist or offset the effects of continued pricing pressure through our valueadded services improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures or if we have to reduce our prices our sales and profitability may suffer 

consolidation in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries continue to experience a significant amount of consolidation as a result of this consolidation competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased in addition group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has placed pricing pressure on suppliers further consolidation within the industries we serve could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products 

the medical technology industry is very competitive and customer demands andor new products in the marketplace could cause a reduction in demand 

the medical technology industry is subject to rapid technological changes and we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold we face this competition from a wide range of companies including large medical device companies some of which have greater financial and marketing resources than we do we also face competition from firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets in some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for diseases that may be delivered via their own or without a medical device the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology may reduce customer demand for our products or render some of our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive in addition any failure or inability to meet increased customer quality expectations could cause a reduction in demand 

business and operational risks 

disruption in our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make and sell products and have a negative impact on our reputation performance or financial condition 

we have manufacturing sites throughout the world in some instances however the manufacturing of certain product lines is concentrated in one or only a few of our plants the functioning of our manufacturing and distribution assets and systems could be disrupted for reasons either within or beyond our control including without limitation extreme weather or longerterm climatic changes natural disasters pandemic war accidental damage disruption to the supply of material or services product quality and safety issues systems failure workforce actions or environmental matters there is a risk that incident management systems in place may prove inadequate and that any disruption may materially adversely affect our ability to make and sell products and therefore materially adversely affect our reputation performance or financial condition 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that vary by country and which could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

we conduct business in most of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world our international operations and our ability to implement our overall business strategy including our plan to continue expanding into emerging andor fastergrowing markets outside of the us are subject to risks and uncertainties that can vary by country and include transportation delays and interruptions political and economic instability and disruptions including the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union imposition of duties and tariffs import and export controls the risks of divergent business expectations or cultural incompatibility inherent in establishing and maintaining operations in foreign countries difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations labor strikes andor disputes and potentially adverse tax consequences limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies with third parties or our joint venture partners outside of the us could also create exposure in addition we may not be able to operate in compliance with foreign laws and regulations or comply with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject in the event that these laws or regulations change any of these events could have an adverse effect on our international operations in the future by reducing the demand for our products or decreasing the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

disruptions in the supply of key raw materials could adversely impact our operations 

we generally purchase our raw materials and supplies required for the production of our products in the open market for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability or cost effectiveness many components and raw materials are available andor purchased only from a single supplier due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products and the availability of such raw materials we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for these components or raw materials or do so without excessive cost as a result a reduction or interruption in supply or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

raw material and energy prices have a significant impact on our profitability if raw material andor energy prices increase and we cannot pass those price increases on to our customers our profitability and financial condition may suffer 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers which include synthetic and natural material aluminum and plastic in addition our manufacturing facilities consume a wide variety of energy products to fuel heat and cool our operations supply and demand factors which are beyond our control generally affect the price of our raw materials and utility costs if we are unable to pass along increased raw material prices and energy costs to our customers our profitability and thus our financial condition may be adversely affected the prices of many of these raw materials and utilities are cyclical and volatile for example the prices of certain commodities particularly petroleumbased raw materials have in the recent past exhibited rapid changes affecting the cost of synthetic elastomers and plastic while we generally attempt to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of sales price increases historically there has been a time delay between raw material andor energy price increases and our ability to increase the prices of our products in some circumstances we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pressure and other factors 

if we are not timely or successful in newproduct innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems our future revenues and operating income could be adversely affected 

our growth partly depends on newproduct innovation and the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications product development and commercialization is inherently uncertain and is subject to a number of factors outside of our control including any necessary regulatory approvals and commercial acceptance for the products the ultimate timing and successful commercialization of new products and systems requires substantial evaluations of the functional operational clinical and economic viability of our products in addition the timely and adequate availability of filling capacity is essential to both conducting definitive stability trials and the timing of commercialization of customers’ products in crystal zenith vials syringes and cartridges delays interruptions or failures in developing and commercializing newproduct innovations or proprietary multicomponent systems could adversely affect future revenues and operating income in addition adverse conditions may also result in future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we may not succeed in finding and completing acquisitions or other strategic transactions which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we have historically engaged in acquisition activity and we may in the future engage in acquisitions or other strategic transactions such as joint ventures or investments in other entities we may be unable to identify suitable targets opportunistic or otherwise for acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future if we identify a suitable candidate our ability to successfully implement the strategic transaction would depend on a variety of factors including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and to comply with the restrictions contained in our debt agreements strategic transactions involve risks including those associated with integrating the operations or maintaining the operations as separate as applicable financial reporting disparate technologies and personnel of acquired companies joint ventures or related companies managing geographically dispersed operations or other strategic investments the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience the potential loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies joint ventures or companies in which we may make strategic investments and potentially other unknown risks we may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire or strategically develop in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits relating to any such strategic transactions strategic transactions may be expensive time consuming and may strain our resources strategic transactions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of among other things the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill additional carrying costs of patent or trademark portfolios and amortization expenses of other intangible assets in addition strategic transactions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities 

product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 

the design manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical packaging and medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects unanticipated use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market a recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals please refer to note 3 revenue  for the discussion of the voluntary recall of our vial2bag ® product line 

a loss of key personnel or highly skilled employees could disrupt our operations 

our future success depends in large part on our ability to retain key employees including our executive officers and individuals in technical marketing sales and research positions competition for experienced employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees our business could be adversely affected although we believe that we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise our inability to do so on a timely basis could disrupt the operations of the unit affected or our overall operations in addition because of the complex nature of many of our products and programs we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled engineering staff and workforce our operations could be disrupted by a shortage of available skilled employees 

our results of operations and earnings may not meet guidance or expectations  

we provide public guidance on our expected results of operations for future periods this guidance is comprised of forwardlooking statements subject to risks and uncertainties including the risks and uncertainties described in this form 10k and in our other public filings and public statements and is based on assumptions we make at the time we provide such guidance our guidance may not always be accurate if in the future our results of operations for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or if we reduce our guidance for future periods the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 

if we fail to comply with our obligations under our distributorship or license agreements with daikyo or the agreements are terminated early or not renewed we could lose license rights and access to certain product and technology that are important to our business 

key valueadded and proprietary products and processes are licensed from our affiliate daikyo including but not limited to crystal zenith flurotec ® and b2coating technologies our rights to these products and processes are licensed pursuant to agreements that expire in 2027 however if the agreements are terminated early or not renewed our business could be adversely impacted please refer to note 7 affiliated companies  for information relating to the increase in our ownership interest in daikyo in 2019 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to regulation by governments around the world and if these regulations are not complied with existing and future operations may be curtailed and we could be subject to liability 

the design development manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our products and our customers’ products that incorporate our products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the us europe and other countries including the fda the european medicines agency and the national medical products administration china complying with governmental regulation can be costly and can result in required modification or withdrawal of existing products and a substantial delay in the introduction of new products failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or failure to obtain regulatory approval for a new product could result in expenses and actions that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

products that incorporate our technologies and medical devices that we produce are subject to regulations and extensive approval or clearance processes which make the timing and success of newproduct commercialization difficult to predict 

the process of obtaining and maintaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is expensive and timeconsuming historically most medical devices that incorporate our technologies and medical devices that we produce have been subject to the fda’s 510k marketing approval process which typically lasts from six to nine months supplemental or full premarket approval reviews require a significantly longer period delaying commercialization changes in regulation on a global scale must be monitored and actions taken to ensure ongoing compliance pharmaceutical products that incorporate our technologies and medical devices that we produce are subject to the fda’s new drug application process which typically takes a number of years to complete additionally biotechnology products that incorporate our technologies and medical devices that we produce are subject to the fda’s biologics license application process which also typically takes a number of years to complete outside of the us sales of medical devices and pharmaceutical or biotechnology products are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary from country to country the time required to obtain approval for sale internationally may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval there is no certainty that any regulatory approval may be obtained or maintained indefinitely and our ability to launch products to the market and maintain market presence is not guaranteed 

changes in the regulation of drug products and devices may increase competitive pressure and adversely affect our business 

an effect of the governmental regulation of our medical devices and our customers’ drug products devices and manufacturing processes is that compliance with regulations makes it difficult to change components and devices produced by one supplier with those from another supplier due to the large amount of data and information that customers must generate to demonstrate that the components and devices are equivalent and pose no additional risk to the patient the regulation of our medical devices and our customers’ products that incorporate our components and devices has increased over time if the applicable regulations were to be modified in a way that reduced the level of data and information needed to prove equivalency for a change from one supplier’s components or devices to those made by another it is likely that the competitive pressure would increase and adversely affect our sales and profitability 

if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights our ability to compete may be affected 

our patents trademarks and other intellectual property are important to our business we rely on patent trademark copyright trade secret and other intellectual property laws as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary products information technologies and processes we also have obligations with respect to the nonuse and nondisclosure of thirdparty intellectual property we may need to engage in litigation or similar activities to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others any such litigation could require us to expend significant resources and divert the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel from our business operations there can be no assurance that the steps we will take to prevent misappropriation infringement or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of others will be successful in addition effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for some of our proprietary products in some countries failure to protect our intellectual property or successfully invalidate or defend against intellectual property protections of third parties could harm our business and results of operations in addition if relevant and effective patent protection is not available or has expired we may not be able to prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar or duplicative to ours 

significant developments in us policies could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

changes in us social political regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development immigration and investment could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our operations must comply with environmental statutes and regulations and any failure to comply could result in extensive costs which would harm our business 

the manufacture of some of our products has involved and may continue to involve the use transportation storage and disposal of hazardous or toxic materials and is subject to various environmental protection and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate this has exposed us in the past and could expose us in the future to risks of accidental contamination and events of noncompliance with environmental laws any such occurrences could result in regulatory enforcement or personal injury and property damage claims or could lead to a shutdown of some of our operations which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations we currently incur costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations and these costs may become more significant 

healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in the us or international healthcare systems could result in reduced demand for our products as our sales depend in part on the extent to which pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities private insurers and other thirdparty payers for the costs of our products the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers which can vary among public and private sources may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these products in a particular jurisdiction legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the us or abroad for example those under consideration in france germany italy and the united kingdom could significantly reduce reimbursement for our customers’ products which could in turn reduce the demand for our products 

moreover in the coming years additional changes could be made to global governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our products we will continue to evaluate healthcare reform as well as trends and changes that may be encouraged by healthcare legislation globally and that may potentially impact our business over time 

the uncertain effects of climate change and potential climate change legislation could lead to business interruption significantly increased costs andor other adverse consequences to our business 

climate change and potential climate change legislation may present risks to our operations including business interruption significantly increased costs andor other adverse consequences to our business some of the potential impacts of climate change to our business include physical risks to our facilities water and energy supply limitations or interruptions disruptions to our supply chain and impairment of other resources in addition if legislation or regulations are enacted or promulgated in the us europe or asia or any other jurisdictions in which we do business that limit or reduce allowable greenhouse gas emissions and other emissions such restrictions could have a significant effect on our operating and financial decisions including those involving capital expenditures to reduce emissions and our results of operations our manufacturing operations may not be able to operate as planned if we are not able to comply with new legal and regulatory legislation around climate change or it may become too costly to operate in a profitable manner additionally suppliers’ added expenses could be passed on to us in the form of higher prices and we may not be able to pass on such expenses to our customers through price increases

net cash provided by operating activities 

2020 compared to 2019 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 1053 million in 2020 primarily due to improved operating results and changes in assets and liabilities 

2019 compared to 2018 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 786 million in 2019 primarily due to improved operating results and changes in assets and liabilities 

net cash used in investing activities 

2020 compared to 2019 

net cash used in investing activities decreased by 485 million in 2020 primarily due to 2019 investing activities that did not recur in 2020 such as our increase in daikyo ownership and the acquisition of our south korea distributor in 2019 these reductions in investing activities were offset in 2020 by an increase in capital expenditures to support our increased customer demands 

2019 compared to 2018 

net cash used in investing activities increased by 1272 million in 2019 primarily due to the increase in our ownership interest in daikyo an increase in capital expenditures and the acquisition of our distributor in south korea in 2019 

net cash used in financing activities 

2020 compared to 2019 

net cash used in financing activities increased by 1003 million in 2020 primarily due an increase in purchases under our share repurchases program and given 2019 included new longterm borrowings while no such new borrowings occurred in 2020 

2019 compared to 2018 

net cash used in financing activities decreased by 439 million in 2019 primarily due to borrowings of 900 million under our term loan partially offset by net repayments of our outstanding longterm borrowings under our credit facility and increases in purchases under our share repurchases programs and dividend payments 

liquidity and capital resources 

the table below presents selected liquidity and capital measures as of 



cash and cash equivalents include all instruments that have maturities of ninety days or less when purchased working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities 

cash and cash equivalents – our cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2020 consisted of cash held in depository accounts with banks around the world and cash invested in highquality shortterm investments the cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2020 included 2935 million of cash held by subsidiaries within the us and 3220 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the us in response to the 2017 tax act we reevaluated our position regarding permanent reinvestment of foreign subsidiary earnings and profits through 2017 with the exception of china and mexico and decided that those profits were no longer permanently reinvested as of january 1 2018 we reasserted indefinite reinvestment related to all post2017 unremitted earnings in all of our foreign subsidiaries in general it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and repatriate earnings only when the tax impact is de minimis and that position has not changed subsequent to the onetime transition tax under the 2017 tax act except as noted above accordingly no deferred taxes have been provided for withholding taxes or other taxes that would result upon repatriation of approximately 3456 million of undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries to the us as those earnings continue to be permanently reinvested further it is impracticable for us to estimate any future tax costs for any unrecognized deferred tax liabilities associated with our indefinite reinvestment assertion because the actual tax liability if any would be dependent on complex analysis and calculations considering various tax laws exchange rates circumstances existing when there is a repatriation sale or liquidation or other factors 

working capital  working capital at december 31 2020 increased by 1532 million or 214 as compared to december 31 2019 including an increase of 32 million due to foreign currency translation excluding the impact of currency exchange rates cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable inventories and total current liabilities increased by 1560 million 525 million 737 million and 1191 million respectively the increase in accounts receivable was due to increased sales activity the increase in inventories that occurred in the period was to ensure we have sufficient inventory on hand to support the needs of our customers the increase in total current liabilities was primarily due to increases in accounts payable accrued salaries wages and benefits accrued expenses and income taxes payable 

debt and credit facilities  the 21 million decrease in total debt at december 31 2020 as compared to december 31 2019 resulted from debt repayments under our term loan 

our sources of liquidity include our credit facility at december 31 2020 we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility at december 31 2020 the borrowing capacity available under the credit facility including outstanding letters of credit of 25 million was 2975 million we do not expect any significant limitations on our ability to access this source of funds please refer to note 10 debt  for further discussion of our credit facility 

pursuant to the financial covenants in our debt agreements we are required to maintain established interest coverage ratios and to not exceed established leverage ratios in addition the agreements contain other customary covenants none of which we consider restrictive to our operations at december 31 2020 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements throughout 2021 

we believe that cash on hand and cash generated from operations together with availability under our credit facility will be adequate to address our foreseeable liquidity needs based on our current expectations of our business operations capital expenditures and scheduled payments of debt obligations 

commitments and contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our commitments and contractual obligations at december 31 2020 these obligations are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity 



1 our business creates a need to enter into various commitments with suppliers including for the purchase of raw materials and finished goods in accordance with us gaap these purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets these purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements and are in the normal course of business 

2 for fixedrate longterm debt interest was based on principal amounts and fixed coupon rates at yearend future interest payments on variablerate debt were calculated using principal amounts and the applicable ending interest rate at yearend interest on floatingrate derivative instruments was based on notional amounts and floating interest rates contractually obligated at yearend 

3 represents acquisitionrelated contingencies in connection with certain business acquisitions we agreed to make payments to the sellers if and when certain operating milestones are achieved such as sales and operating income targets 

4 this table does not include obligations pertaining to pension and postretirement benefits because the actual amount and timing of future contributions may vary significantly depending upon plan asset performance benefit payments and other factors in 2021 we expect to contribute 36 million to pension plans of which 29 million is for international plans in addition we expect to contribute 07 million for other retirement benefits in 2021 please refer to note 15 benefit plans  for estimated benefit payments over the next ten years 

reserves for uncertain tax positions  the table above does not include 104 million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2020 due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for amounts which may be paid 

letters of credit  we have letters of credit totaling 25 million supporting the reimbursement of workers’ compensation and other claims paid on our behalf by insurance carriers our accrual for insurance obligations was 30 million at december 31 2020 of which 09 million is in excess of our deductible and therefore is reimbursable by the insurance company 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2020 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements other than unconditional purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business and outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with us gaap the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions some of which are subjective and complex that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our results of operations and financial position 

revenue recognition our revenue results from the sale of goods or services and reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services we record revenue based on a fivestep model in accordance with asc topic 606 “asc 606” following the identification of a contract with a customer we identify the performance obligations goods or services in the contract determine the transaction price allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and recognize the revenue when or as we satisfy the performance obligations by transferring the promised goods or services to our customers a good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that good or service 

we recognize the majority of our revenue primarily relating to proprietary products product sales at a point in time following the transfer of control of our products to our customers which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the related agreements 

we recognize revenue relating to our contractmanufactured products product sales and certain proprietary products product sales over time as our performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to us and we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date 

we recognize revenue relating to our development and tooling agreements over time as our performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced 

for revenue recognized over time revenue is recognized by applying a method of measuring progress toward complete satisfaction of the related performance obligation when selecting the method for measuring progress we select the method that best depicts the transfer of control of goods or services promised to our customers 

revenue for our contractmanufactured products product sales certain proprietary products product sales and our development and tooling agreements is recorded under an input method which recognizes revenue on the basis of our efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation for example resources consumed labor hours expended costs incurred time elapsed or machine hours used relative to the total expected inputs to the satisfaction of that performance obligation the input method that we use is based on costs incurred 

the majority of the performance obligations within our contracts are satisfied within one year or less performance obligations satisfied beyond one year include those relating to a nonrefundable customer payment of 200 million received in june 2013 in return for the exclusive use of the smartdose technology platform within a specific therapeutic area as of december 31 2020 there was 47 million of unearned income related to this payment of which 09 million was included in other current liabilities and 38 million was included in other longterm liabilities the unearned income is being recognized as income on a straightline basis over the remaining term of the agreement the agreement does not include a future minimum purchase commitment from the customer 

our revenue can be generated from contracts with multiple performance obligations when a sales agreement involves multiple performance obligations each obligation is separately identified and the transaction price is allocated based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised good or service to the customer 

some customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes we record rebate costs when sales occur based on our assessment of the likelihood that the required volumes will be attained we also maintain an allowance for product returns as we believe that we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of returns based on our substantial historical experience and specific identification of customer claims 

contract assets and liabilities result from transactions with revenue recorded primarily over time if the measure of remaining rights exceeds the measure of the remaining performance obligations we record a contract asset contract assets are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in accounts receivable net and other assets current and noncurrent portions respectively contract assets included in accounts receivable net relate to the unbilled amounts of our product sales for which we have recognized revenue over time contract assets included in other assets represent the remaining performance obligations of our development and tooling agreements conversely if the measure of the remaining performance obligations exceeds the measure of the remaining rights we record a contract liability contract liabilities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in other liabilities current and noncurrent portions respectively and represent cash payments received in advance of our performance 

impairment of longlived assets longlived assets including property plant and equipment and operating lease rightofuse assets are tested for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable an asset is considered impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future expected undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset once an asset is considered impaired an impairment loss is recorded within other expense income for the difference between the asset’s carrying value and its fair value for assets held and used in the business management determines fair value using estimated future cash flows to be derived from the asset discounted to a net present value using an appropriate discount rate for assets held for sale or for investment purposes management determines fair value by estimating the proceeds to be received upon sale of the asset less disposition costs 

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually following the completion of our annual budget and longrange planning process or whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is the same as or one level below our operating segments a goodwill impairment charge represents the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test such as future sales future cash flows and longterm growth rates are consistent with internal projections and operating plans amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test are also largely dependent on the continued sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products as well as our timeliness and success in newproduct innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems changes in the estimate of fair value including the estimate of future cash flows could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position accounting guidance also allows entities to first assess qualitative factors including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors and overall financial performance to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test we elected to follow this guidance for our annual impairment test based upon our assessment we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was less than its carrying amount and determined that it was not necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test 

intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 

employee benefits we maintain funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans in the us and a number of other countries that cover employees who meet eligibility requirements in addition we sponsor postretirement benefit plans which provide healthcare benefits for eligible employees who retire or become disabled postretirement benefit plans are limited to only those active employees who met the eligibility requirements as of january 1 2017 the measurement of annual cost and obligations under these defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to a number of assumptions which are specific for each of our us and foreign plans the assumptions which are reviewed at least annually are relevant to both the plan assets where applicable and the obligation for benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees two of the most critical assumptions in determining pension expense are the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement age rates of compensation increases mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience for our funded plans we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our plan assets as well as historical and expected rates of return in estimating the longterm rate of return on plan assets one of the most critical assumptions in determining retiree mental plan expense is the discount rate under us gaap differences between actual and expected results are generally accumulated in other comprehensive income loss as actuarial gains or losses and subsequently amortized into earnings over future periods 

changes in key assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position we estimate that every 25basis point reduction in our longterm rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by 06 million and every 25basis point reduction in our discount rate would decrease pension expense by 01 million a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations our net pension underfunded balance at december 31 2020 was 408 million compared to 438 million at december 31 2019 our underfunded balance for other postretirement benefits was 61 million at december 31 2020 compared to 66 million at december 31 2019 

income taxes we estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation in addition deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates to tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of our assets and liabilities the enacted statutory tax rate applied is based on the rate expected to be applicable at the time of the forecasted utilization of the loss carryforward or reversal of the temporary difference valuation allowances on deferred tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized the realizability of deferred tax assets is subject to our estimates of future taxable income generally at the respective subsidiary company and country level changes in tax legislation business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined 

when accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements we apply a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our ongoing business operations expose us to various risks such as fluctuating interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and increasing commodity prices these risk factors can impact our results of operations cash flows and financial position to manage these market risks we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps options and foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with and for notional amounts equal to or less than the related underlying exposures we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for investment or trading purposes all derivatives are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 

foreign currency exchange risk 

sales outside of the us accounted for 546 of our consolidated net sales in 2020 virtually all of these sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into usd for consolidated reporting purposes although the majority of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary they may also hold assets or liabilities denominated in other currencies these items may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains and losses as a result our results of operations and financial position are exposed to changing currency exchange rates we periodically use forward exchange contracts to hedge certain transactions or to manage monthend balance sheet exposures on crosscurrency intercompany loans 

we have entered into forward exchange contracts designated as fair value hedges to manage our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates on crosscurrency intercompany loans as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 the total amount of these forward exchange contracts were sgd 6015 million and 134 million 

in addition we have entered into several foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges for periods of up to eighteen months intended to hedge the currency risk associated with a portion of our forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies as of december 31 2020 we had outstanding foreign currency contracts to purchase and sell certain pairs of currencies as follows 



in november and december 2019 in conjunction with the repayment of the outstanding longterm borrowings under our credit facility denominated in euro and yen we dedesignated these borrowings as hedges of our net investments in certain european subsidiaries and daikyo the amounts recorded as a cumulative translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to these borrowings prior to dedesignation will remain in accumulated other comprehensive loss indefinitely unless certain future events occur such as the disposition of the operations for which the net investment hedges relate 

in december 2019 in conjunction with the repayment of the outstanding longterm borrowings under our credit facility denominated in yen we entered into a forward exchange contract designated as a cash flow hedge to manage our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates this forward exchange contract matured on december 30 2019 

in december 2019 we entered into a fiveyear floatingtofloating forwardstarting crosscurrency swap the “crosscurrency swap” for 90 million which we designated as a hedge of our net investment in daikyo the notional amount of the crosscurrency swap is ¥96 billion 878 million as of december 31 2020 under the crosscurrency swap we receive floating interest rate payments based on threemonth usd libor plus a margin in return for paying floating interest rate payments based on threemonth yen libor plus a margin 

interest rate risk 

as a result of our normal borrowing activities we have longterm debt with both fixed and variable interest rates longterm debt consists of our term loan and series a b and c notes 

the following table summarizes our interest rate risksensitive instruments excluding unamortized debt issuance costs 



commodity price risk 

many of our proprietary products are made from synthetic elastomers which are derived from the petroleum refining process we purchase the majority of our elastomers via longterm supply contracts some of which contain clauses that provide for surcharges related to fluctuations in crude oil prices in recent years raw material costs have fluctuated due to crude oil price fluctuations we expect this volatility to continue and will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects on gross profit 

from november 2017 through december 2020 we purchased several series of call options for a total of 472477 barrels of crude oil to mitigate our exposure to such oilbased surcharges and protect operating cash flows with regards to a portion of our forecasted elastomer purchases 

during 2020 the loss recorded in cost of goods and services sold related to these options was 02 million during 2019 the loss recorded in cost of goods and services sold related to these options was 04 million 

as of december 31 2020 we had outstanding contracts to purchase 141734 barrels of crude oil from january 2021 to june 2022 at a weightedaverage strike price of 5914 per barrel

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our ceo and cfo to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 based on the framework established in “internal controlintegrated framework 2013” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2020 

internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards 

to reduce though not eliminate this risk 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein 

changes in internal controls

see further discussion of our international operations the risks associated with our international operations and our attempt to minimize some of these risks in part i item 1a risk factors part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resources part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk note 1 under the captions financial instruments and foreign currency translation and note 11 derivative financial instruments  

raw materials 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers aluminum and plastic elastomers include both natural and synthetic materials we currently have access to adequate supplies of these raw materials to meet our production needs through agreements with suppliers 

we employ a supply chain management strategy in our business segments which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply due to regulatory control over our production processes sole source availability and the cost and time involved in qualifying suppliers we rely on singlesource suppliers for many critical raw materials we generally purchase certain raw materials in the open market this strategy increases the risk that our supply chain may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production or 

distribution problem these risks are managed when and where possible by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites rigorous quality control systems surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in case of an interruption in production or distribution 

intellectual property 

intellectual property including patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and knowhow is important to our business we own or license intellectual property rights including issued patents and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries that relate to various aspects of our products in 2019 more than 150 patents were issued to west across the globe some key valueadded and proprietary products and processes are licensed from daikyo our intellectual property rights have been useful in establishing our market position and in the growth of our business and are expected to continue to be of value in the future 

seasonality 

our business is not inherently seasonal 

working capital 

we are required to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet customer requirements in addition some of our supply agreements require us to purchase inventory in bulk orders which increases inventory levels but decreases the risk of supply interruption for a more detailed discussion of working capital please refer to the discussion in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resource s

order backlog includes firm orders placed by customers for manufacture over a period of time according to their schedule or upon confirmation by the customer we also have contractual arrangements with a number of our customers products covered by these contracts are included in our backlog only as orders are received order backlog may be positively or negatively impacted by several factors including customer ordering patterns and the necessary leadtime to deliver customer orders order backlog is one of many measures we use to understand future demand and should not be considered in isolation to predict future sales growth 

at december 31 2019 and 2018 the order backlog for proprietary products was 5879 million and 4073 million respectively the increase in backlog primarily reflects increases in demand for our products due to several successful customer launches in 2019 and expansion of current customer programs due to the success of their drug 

products the majority of the order backlog for proprietary products at december 31 2019 is expected to be filled during 2020 

the majority of contractmanufactured products manufacturing activity is governed by contractual volume expectations subject to periodic revisions based on customer requirements 

competition 

with our range of proprietary technologies we compete with several companies across our proprietary products product lines due to the special nature of our pharmaceutical packaging components and our longstanding participation in the market competition for these components is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive costcontrol programs across their operations 

in addition there are a number of competitors supplying medical devices and medical device components including a number of pharmaceutical manufacturers who are also potential customers of our medical devices we compete in this market on the basis of our reputation for quality and reliability in engineering and project management as well as our knowledge of and experience in compliance with regulatory requirements 

we have specialized knowledge of container closure components which is integral to developing delivery systems with our range of proprietary technologies we compete with new and established companies in the area of drug delivery devices including suppliers of prefillable syringes autoinjectors safety needles and other proprietary systems 

we seek to differentiate ourselves from our competition by serving as an integrated drug containment and delivery systems global supplier that can provide preapproval primary packaging support and engineering development analytical lab services and integrated solutions regulatory expertise and aftersale technical support customers also appreciate the global scope of our manufacturing capability and our ability to produce many products at multiple sites 

our contractmanufactured products business operates in very competitive markets for its products the competition varies from smaller regional companies to large global assembly manufacturers given the cost pressures they face many of our customers look to reduce costs by sourcing from lowcost locations we seek to differentiate ourselves by leveraging our global capabilities and by employing new technologies such as highspeed automated assembly insertmolding multishot precision molding and expertise with multiplepiece closure systems 

research and development activities 

we maintain our own researchscale production facilities and laboratories for developing new products and offer contract engineering design and development services to assist customers with new product development our quality control regulatory and laboratory testing capabilities are used to ensure compliance with applicable manufacturing and regulatory standards for primary and secondary pharmaceutical packaging components and delivery systems 

commercial development of our new products and services for medical and pharmaceutical applications commonly requires several years new products that we develop may require separate approval as medical devices and products that are intended to be used in the packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical products are subject to both customer acceptance of our products and regulatory approval of the customer’s products following our development period 

we continue to pursue innovative strategic platforms in prefillable syringes injectable containers advanced injection and safety and administration systems 

we also continue to seek new innovative opportunities for acquisition licensing partnering or development of products services and technologies that serve the injectable drug containment and delivery market 

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various national state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows there were no required material capital expenditures for environmental controls in our facilities in 2019 and there are currently no needed or planned material expenditures for 2020 

employees 

as of december 31 2019 we employed approximately 8200 people in our operations throughout the world

 item 1a risk factors 

the statements in this section describe major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this form 10k contains some forwardlooking statements that are based on management’s beliefs and assumptions current expectations estimates and forecasts we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forwardlooking statements such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts we have attempted wherever possible to identify forwardlooking statements by using words such as “estimate” “expect” “intend” “believe” “plan” “anticipate” and other words and phrases of similar meaning in particular these include statements relating to future actions business plans and prospects new products future 

performance or results of current or anticipated products sales efforts expenses interest rates foreignexchange rates economic effects the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results 

many of the factors that will determine our future results are beyond our ability to control or predict achievement of future results is subject to known or unknown risks or uncertainties including without limitation the risks set forth below therefore actual results could differ materially from past results and those expressed or implied in any forwardlooking statement you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements 

unless required by applicable securities law we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise we also refer you to further disclosures we make on related subjects in our quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k to the sec 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 

the current uncertainty in the global economy including the effects of recession or slow economic growth in the us europe and emerging markets in asia and south america may negatively affect our operating results examples of the effects of these global economic challenges include our suppliers’ and our customers’ inability to access the credit markets at commercially reasonable rates reduction in sales due to customers decreasing their inventories in the nearterm or longterm or due to liquidity difficulties reduction in sales due to shortages of materials we purchase from our suppliers reduction in research and development efforts and expenditures by our customers our inability to hedge our currency and raw material risks sufficiently or at commercially reasonable prices insolvency of suppliers or customers inflationary pressures on our supplies or our products and increased expenses due to growing global taxation of corporate profits or revenues or changes in or expirations of a country’s tax laws or regulations our operating results in one or more geographic regions may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region if economic and market conditions in the us or europe or in emerging markets weaken further we may experience material adverse impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our sales and profitability are largely dependent on the sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products if the drug products developed by our customers in the future use another delivery system or are reconfigured to require less frequent dosing our sales and profitability could suffer 

our business depends to a substantial extent on customers’ continued sales and development of products that are delivered by injection if i our customers fail to continue to sell develop and deploy injectable products ii our customers reconfigure their drug product or develop new drug products requiring less frequent dosing or iii we are unable to develop new products that assist in the delivery of drugs by alternative methods our sales and profitability may suffer 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

our business is subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations sales outside of the us accounted for 557 of our consolidated net sales in 2019 and we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales in the future in addition many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the us further we intend to continue our expansion into emerging andor fastergrowing markets outside of the us in the future virtually all of our international sales assets and related operating costs and expenses are earned valued or incurred in the currency of the local country primarily the euro the singapore dollar “sgd” and the danish krone in addition we are exposed to japanese yen “yen” as we maintain a 49 ownership interest in and we purchase finished goods and other materials from daikyo we are also exposed to currencies in emerging market countries such as the chinese yuan the indian rupee the south korean won and various south american currencies our consolidated financial statements are presented in usd and therefore we must translate the reported values of our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses into usd which can result in significant fluctuations in the amount of those assets liabilities revenues or expenses the 

exchange rates between these foreign currencies and usd in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future increases or decreases in the value of usd compared to these foreign currencies may negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

in addition to translation risks we incur currency transaction risk when we or one of our subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction in a currency other than that entity’s local currency in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in certain exchange rates we have entered and expect to continue to enter into hedging arrangements including the use of financial derivatives there can be no certainty that we will be able to enter into or maintain hedges of these currency risks or that our hedges will be effective which could have a significant effect on our financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to provide comparative value advantages timely fulfill customer orders or resist pricing pressure we will have to reduce our prices which may reduce our profit margins 

we compete with several companies across our major product lines because of the special nature of these products competition is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive costcontrol programs across their operations companies often compete on the basis of price we aim to differentiate ourselves from our competition by being a “fullservice valueadded” global supplier that is able to provide presale compatibility studies engineering support and other services and sophisticated postsale technical support on a global basis however we face continued pricing pressure from our customers and competitors if we are unable to resist or offset the effects of continued pricing pressure through our valueadded services improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures or if we have to reduce our prices our sales and profitability may suffer 

consolidation in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries have experienced a significant amount of consolidation as a result of this consolidation competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased in addition group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has placed pricing pressure on suppliers further consolidation within the industries we serve could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products 

we are subject to regulation by governments around the world and if these regulations are not complied with existing and future operations may be curtailed and we could be subject to liability 

the design development manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our products and our customers’ products that incorporate our products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the us europe and other countries including the us food and drug administration “fda” the european medicines agency and the national medical products administration china complying with governmental regulation can be costly and can result in required modification or withdrawal of existing products and a substantial delay in the introduction of new products failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or failure to obtain regulatory approval for a new product could result in expenses and actions that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

products that incorporate our technologies and medical devices that we produce are subject to regulations and extensive approval or clearance processes which make the timing and success of newproduct commercialization difficult to predict 

the process of obtaining and maintaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is expensive and timeconsuming historically most medical devices that incorporate our technologies and medical devices that we produce have been subject to the fda’s 510k marketing approval process which typically lasts from six to nine months supplemental or full premarket approval reviews require a significantly longer period delaying 

commercialization changes in regulation on a global scale must be monitored and actions taken to ensure ongoing compliance pharmaceutical products that incorporate our technologies and medical devices that we produce are subject to the fda’s new drug application process which typically takes a number of years to complete additionally biotechnology products that incorporate our technologies and medical devices that we produce are subject to the fda’s biologics license application process which also typically takes a number of years to complete outside of the us sales of medical devices and pharmaceutical or biotechnology products are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary from country to country the time required to obtain approval for sale internationally may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval there is no certainty that any regulatory approval may be obtained or maintained indefinitely and our ability to launch products on to the market and maintain market presence is not guaranteed 

changes in the regulation of drug products and devices may increase competitive pressure and adversely affect our business 

an effect of the governmental regulation of our medical devices and our customers’ drug products devices and manufacturing processes is that compliance with regulations makes it difficult to change components and devices produced by one supplier with those from another supplier due to the large amount of data and information that customers must generate to demonstrate that the components and devices are equivalent and pose no additional risk to the patient the regulation of our medical devices and our customers’ products that incorporate our components and devices has increased over time if the applicable regulations were to be modified in a way that reduced the level of data and information needed to prove equivalency for a change from one supplier’s components or devices to those made by another it is likely that the competitive pressure would increase and adversely affect our sales and profitability 

if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights our ability to compete may be affected 

our patents trademarks and other intellectual property are important to our business we rely on patent trademark copyright trade secret and other intellectual property laws as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary products information technologies and processes we also have obligations with respect to the nonuse and nondisclosure of thirdparty intellectual property we may need to engage in litigation or similar activities to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others any such litigation could require us to expend significant resources and divert the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel from our business operations there can be no assurance that the steps we will take to prevent misappropriation infringement or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of others will be successful in addition effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for some of our proprietary products in some countries failure to protect our intellectual property or successfully invalidate or defend against intellectual property protections of third parties could harm our business and results of operations in addition if relevant and effective patent protection is not available or has expired we may not be able to prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar or duplicative to ours 

disruption in our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make and sell products and have a negative impact on our reputation performance or financial condition 

we have manufacturing sites throughout the world in some instances however the manufacturing of certain product lines is concentrated in one or only a few of our plants the functioning of our manufacturing and distribution assets and systems could be disrupted for reasons either within or beyond our control including without limitation extreme weather or longerterm climatic changes natural disasters pandemic war accidental damage disruption to the supply of material or services product quality and safety issues systems failure workforce actions or environmental contamination there is a risk that incident management systems in place may prove inadequate and that any disruption may materially adversely affect our ability to make and sell products and therefore materially adversely affect our reputation performance or financial condition 

the medical technology industry is very competitive and customer demands andor new products in the marketplace could cause a reduction in demand 

the medical technology industry is subject to rapid technological changes and we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold we face this competition from a wide range of companies including large medical device companies some of which have greater financial and marketing resources than we do we also face competition from firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets in some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for diseases that may be delivered via their own or without a medical device the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology may reduce customer demand for our products or render some of our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive in addition any failure or inability to meet increased customer quality expectations could cause a reduction in demand 

significant developments in us policies could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

changes in us social political regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development immigration and investment could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that vary by country and which could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

we conduct business in most of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world our international operations and our ability to implement our overall business strategy including our plan to continue expanding into emerging andor fastergrowing markets outside of the us are subject to risks and uncertainties that can vary by country and include transportation delays and interruptions political and economic instability and disruptions including the united kingdom’s referendum on withdrawal from the european union imposition of duties and tariffs import and export controls the risks of divergent business expectations or cultural incompatibility inherent in establishing and maintaining operations in foreign countries difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations labor strikes andor disputes and potentially adverse tax consequences limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies with third parties or our joint venture partners outside of the us could also create exposure in addition we may not be able to operate in compliance with foreign laws and regulations or comply with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject in the event that these laws or regulations change any of these events could have an adverse effect on our international operations in the future by reducing the demand for our products or decreasing the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

disruptions in the supply of key raw materials could adversely impact our operations 

we generally purchase our raw materials and supplies required for the production of our products in the open market for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability or cost effectiveness many components and raw materials are available andor purchased only from a single supplier due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products and the availability of such raw materials we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for these components or raw materials or do so without excessive cost as a result a reduction or interruption in supply or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

unauthorized access to our or our customers ’ information and systems could negatively impact our business 

our systems and networks as well as those of our customers suppliers service providers and banks have and may in the future become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches which in turn could result in the unauthorized release and misuse of confidential or proprietary information about our company our employees or our customers as well as disrupt our operations or damage our facilities or those of third parties additionally our systems are subject to regulation to preserve the privacy of certain data held on those systems we maintain an extensive network of technical security controls policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems in order to address these threats while these measures are designed to prevent detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems certain types of attacks could result in financial or information losses andor reputational harm if we cannot comply with regulations or prevent the unauthorized access release andor corruption of our or our customers’ confidential classified or personally identifiable information our reputation could be damaged andor we could face financial losses we may also be required to incur additional costs to modify or enhance our systems or to try to prevent or remediate any such attacks modifying or enhancing our systems may result in unanticipated or prolonged disruption events which could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

raw material and energy prices have a significant impact on our profitability if raw material andor energy prices increase and we cannot pass those price increases on to our customers our profitability and financial condition may suffer 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers which include synthetic and natural material aluminum and plastic in addition our manufacturing facilities consume a wide variety of energy products to fuel heat and cool our operations supply and demand factors which are beyond our control generally affect the price of our raw materials and utility costs if we are unable to pass along increased raw material prices and energy costs to our customers our profitability and thus our financial condition may be adversely affected the prices of many of these raw materials and utilities are cyclical and volatile for example the prices of certain commodities particularly petroleumbased raw materials have in the recent past exhibited rapid changes affecting the cost of synthetic elastomers and plastic while we generally attempt to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of sales price increases historically there has been a time delay between raw material andor energy price increases and our ability to increase the prices of our products in some circumstances we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pressure and other factors 

if we are not timely or successful in newproduct innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems our future revenues and operating income could be adversely affected 

our growth partly depends on newproduct innovation and the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications product development and commercialization is inherently uncertain and is subject to a number of factors outside of our control including any necessary regulatory approvals and commercial acceptance for the products the ultimate timing and successful commercialization of new products and systems requires substantial evaluations of the functional operational clinical and economic viability of our products in addition the timely and adequate availability of filling capacity is essential to both conducting definitive stability trials and the timing of commercialization of customers’ products in crystal zenith vials syringes and cartridges delays interruptions or failures in developing and commercializing newproduct innovations or proprietary multicomponent systems could adversely affect future revenues and operating income in addition adverse conditions may also result in future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we may not succeed in finding and completing acquisitions or other strategic transactions which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we have historically engaged in acquisition activity and we may in the future engage in acquisitions or other strategic transactions such as joint ventures or investments in other entities we may be unable to identify suitable 

targets opportunistic or otherwise for acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future if we identify a suitable candidate our ability to successfully implement the strategic transaction would depend on a variety of factors including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and to comply with the restrictions contained in our debt agreements strategic transactions involve risks including those associated with integrating the operations or maintaining the operations as separate as applicable financial reporting disparate technologies and personnel of acquired companies joint ventures or related companies managing geographically dispersed operations or other strategic investments the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience the potential loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies joint ventures or companies in which we may make strategic investments and potentially other unknown risks we may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire or strategically develop in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits relating to any such strategic transactions strategic transactions may be expensive time consuming and may strain our resources strategic transactions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of among other things the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill additional carrying costs of patent or trademark portfolios and amortization expenses of other intangible assets in addition strategic transactions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities 

product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 

the design manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical packaging and medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects unanticipated use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market a recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals please refer to note 3 revenue  for the discussion of the voluntary recall of our vial2bag ® product line 

our operations must comply with environmental statutes and regulations and any failure to comply could result in extensive costs which would harm our business 

the manufacture of some of our products has involved and may continue to involve the use transportation storage and disposal of hazardous or toxic materials and is subject to various environmental protection and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate this has exposed us in the past and could expose us in the future to risks of accidental contamination and events of noncompliance with environmental laws any such occurrences could result in regulatory enforcement or personal injury and property damage claims or could lead to a shutdown of some of our operations which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations we currently incur costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations and these costs may become more significant 

a loss of key personnel or highly skilled employees could disrupt our operations 

our future success depends in large part on our ability to retain key employees including our executive officers and individuals in technical marketing sales and research positions competition for experienced employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees our business could be adversely affected although we believe that we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise our inability to do so on a timely basis could disrupt the operations of the unit affected or our overall operations in addition because of the complex nature of many of our products and programs we are generally 

dependent on an educated and highly skilled engineering staff and workforce our operations could be disrupted by a shortage of available skilled employees 

the uncertain effects of climate change and potential climate change legislation could lead to business interruption significantly increased costs andor other adverse consequences to our business 

climate change and potential climate change legislation may present risks to our operations including business interruption significantly increased costs andor other adverse consequences to our business some of the potential impacts of climate change to our business include physical risks to our facilities water and energy supply limitations or interruptions disruptions to our supply chain and impairment of other resources in addition if legislation or regulations are enacted or promulgated in the us europe or asia or any other jurisdictions in which we do business that limit or reduce allowable greenhouse gas emissions and other emissions such restrictions could have a significant effect on our operating and financial decisions including those involving capital expenditures to reduce emissions and our results of operations our manufacturing operations may not be able to operate as planned if we are not able to comply with new legal and regulatory legislation around climate change or it may become too costly to operate in a profitable manner additionally suppliers’ added expenses could be passed on to us in the form of higher prices and we may not be able to pass on such expenses to our customers through price increases 

healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in the us or international healthcare systems including the patient protection and affordable care act the “ppaca” could result in reduced demand for our products as our sales depend in part on the extent to which pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities private insurers and other thirdparty payers for the costs of our products the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers which can vary among public and private sources may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these products in a particular jurisdiction legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the us including the possible termination of the ppaca and potential replacement thereafter with a different system or abroad for example those under consideration in france germany italy and the united kingdom could significantly reduce reimbursement for our customers’ products which could in turn reduce the demand for our products 

moreover in the coming years additional changes could be made to global governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our products we will continue to evaluate the ppaca as amended the implementation of regulations or guidance related to various provisions of the ppaca by federal agencies the potential repeal and replacement of the ppaca as well as trends and changes that may be encouraged by the legislation and other healthcare legislation globally and that may potentially impact our business over time 

libor reform may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our variablerate debt which includes our new senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility agreement the “credit agreement” and our new term loan the “term loan” currently use the london interbank offered rate libor as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate libor is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform these proposals for reform and other pressures may cause libor to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past if the method for calculation of libor changes if libor is no longer available or if lenders have increased costs due to changes in libor we may suffer from potential increases in interest rates on our variablerate debt which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows further we may need to amend our credit agreement and term loan as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace libor with the new standard that is established we will continue to monitor the proposals for reform relating to libor 

no assurance can be given that we will continue to pay or declare dividends 

we have historically paid dividends however there can be no assurance that we will pay or declare dividends in the future the actual declaration and payment of future dividends the amount of any such dividends and the 

establishment of record and payment dates if any are subject to determination by our board of directors each quarter after its review of our thencurrent strategy applicable debt covenants and financial performance and position among other things our declaration and payment of future dividends is subject to risks and uncertainties including deterioration of our financial performance or position inability to declare a dividend in compliance with applicable laws or debt covenants an increase in our cash needs or decrease in available cash and the business judgment of the board of directors that a declaration of a dividend is not in our best interest 

our results of operations and earnings may not meet guidance or expectations  

we provide public guidance on our expected results of operations for future periods this guidance is comprised of forwardlooking statements subject to risks and uncertainties including the risks and uncertainties described in this form 10k and in our other public filings and public statements and is based necessarily on assumptions we make at the time we provide such guidance our guidance may not always be accurate if in the future our results of operations for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or if we reduce our guidance for future periods the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 

we are exposed to credit risk on accounts receivable and certain prepayments made in the normal course of business this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

a substantial majority of our outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance in addition we have made prepayments associated with insurance premiums and other advances in the normal course of business while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on trade receivables and other current assets there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk and avoid losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

if we fail to comply with our obligations under our distributorship or license agreements with daikyo the agreements are terminated early or we are unable to renew these agreements on the same or substantially similar terms we could lose license rights that are important to our business 

key valueadded and proprietary products and processes are licensed from our affiliate daikyo including but not limited to crystal zenith flurotec ® and b2coating technologies our rights to these products and processes are licensed pursuant to agreements that expire in 2027 however if the agreements are terminated early our business could be adversely impacted please refer to note 7 affiliated companies for information relating to the increase in our ownership interest in daikyo in 2019

net cash used in investing activities

liquidity and capital resources 

the table below presents selected liquidity and capital measures as of 



cash and cash equivalents include all instruments that have maturities of ninety days or less when purchased working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities 

cash and cash equivalents – our cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2019 consisted of cash held in depository accounts with banks around the world and cash invested in highquality shortterm investments the cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2019 included 2172 million of cash held by subsidiaries within the us and 2219 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the us in response to the 2017 tax act we reevaluated our position regarding permanent reinvestment of foreign subsidiary earnings and profits through 2017 with the exception of china and mexico and decided that those profits were no longer permanently reinvested as of january 1 2018 we reasserted indefinite reinvestment related to all post2017 unremitted earnings in all of our foreign subsidiaries in general it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and repatriate earnings only when the tax impact is de minimis and that position has not changed subsequent to the onetime transition tax under the 2017 tax act except as noted above accordingly no deferred taxes have been provided for withholding taxes or other taxes that would result upon repatriation of approximately 2142 million of undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries to the us as those earnings continue to be permanently reinvested further it is impracticable for us to estimate any future tax costs for any unrecognized deferred tax liabilities associated with our indefinite reinvestment assertion because the actual tax liability if any would be dependent on complex analysis and calculations considering various tax laws exchange rates circumstances existing when there is a repatriation sale or liquidation or other factors 

working capital  working capital at december 31 2019 increased by 1064 million or 174 as compared to december 31 2018 including an increase of 113 million due to foreign currency translation excluding the impact of currency exchange rates cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable inventories and total current liabilities increased by 1024 million 333 million 232 million and 600 million respectively the increase in accounts receivable was due to increased sales activity and longer customer payment terms the increase in total current liabilities was primarily due to increases in accounts payable accrued salaries wages and benefits and other current liabilities as well as our adoption of accounting standards codification “asc” topic 842 “asc 842” which required us to record operating lease liabilities for operating leases where we are the lessee in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2019 

debt and credit facilities  the 612 million increase in total debt at december 31 2019 as compared to december 31 2018 primarily resulted from borrowings of 900 million under our term loan partially offset by net repayments of our outstanding longterm borrowings under our credit facility foreign currency rate fluctuations and an increase in unamortized debt issuance costs 

our sources of liquidity include our credit facility at december 31 2019 we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility as we repaid the outstanding longterm borrowings denominated in euro and yen in november 

and december 2019 respectively there was no material gain or loss on the repayment under the credit facility at december 31 2019 the borrowing capacity available under the credit facility including outstanding letters of credit of 25 million was 2975 million we do not expect any significant limitations on our ability to access this source of funds please refer to note 10 debt  for further discussion of our credit facility 

pursuant to the financial covenants in our debt agreements we are required to maintain established interest coverage ratios and to not exceed established leverage ratios in addition the agreements contain other customary covenants none of which we consider restrictive to our operations at december 31 2019 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements throughout 2020 

we believe that cash on hand and cash generated from operations together with availability under our credit facility will be adequate to address our foreseeable liquidity needs based on our current expectations of our business operations capital expenditures and scheduled payments of debt obligations 

commitments and contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our commitments and contractual obligations at december 31 2019 these obligations are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity 



1 our business creates a need to enter into various commitments with suppliers including for the purchase of raw materials and finished goods in accordance with us gaap these purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets these purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements and are in the normal course of business 

2 for fixedrate longterm debt interest was based on principal amounts and fixed coupon rates at yearend future interest payments on variablerate debt were calculated using principal amounts and the applicable ending interest rate at yearend interest on fixedrate derivative instruments was based on notional amounts and fixed interest rates contractually obligated at yearend 

3 represents acquisitionrelated contingencies in connection with certain business acquisitions we agreed to make payments to the sellers if and when certain operating milestones are achieved such as sales and operating income targets 

4 this table does not include obligations pertaining to pension and postretirement benefits because the actual amount and timing of future contributions may vary significantly depending upon plan asset performance benefit payments and other factors contributions to our plans are expected to be 14 million in 2020 please refer to note 15 benefit plans  for estimated benefit payments over the next ten years 

reserves for uncertain tax positions  the table above does not include 50 million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2019 due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for amounts which may be paid 

letters of credit  we have letters of credit totaling 25 million supporting the reimbursement of workers’ compensation and other claims paid on our behalf by insurance carriers our accrual for insurance obligations was 32 million at december 31 2019 of which 09 million is in excess of our deductible and therefore is reimbursable by the insurance company

at december 31 2019 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements other than unconditional purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business and outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with us gaap the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions some of which are subjective and complex that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our results of operations and financial position 

revenue recognition our revenue results from the sale of goods or services and reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services we record revenue based on a fivestep model in accordance with asc topic 606 “asc 606” following the identification of a contract with a customer we identify the performance obligations goods or services in the contract determine the transaction price allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and recognize the revenue when or as we satisfy the performance obligations by transferring the promised goods or services to our customers a good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that good or service 

we recognize the majority of our revenue primarily relating to proprietary products product sales at a point in time following the transfer of control of our products to our customers which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the related agreements 

we recognize revenue relating to our contractmanufactured products product sales and certain proprietary products product sales over time as our performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to us and we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date 

we recognize revenue relating to our development and tooling agreements over time as our performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced 

for revenue recognized over time revenue is recognized by applying a method of measuring progress toward complete satisfaction of the related performance obligation when selecting the method for measuring progress we select the method that best depicts the transfer of control of goods or services promised to our customers 

revenue for our contractmanufactured products product sales certain proprietary products product sales and our development and tooling agreements is recorded under an input method which recognizes revenue on the basis of our efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation for example resources consumed labor hours expended costs incurred time elapsed or machine hours used relative to the total expected inputs to the satisfaction of that performance obligation the input method that we use is based on costs incurred 

the majority of the performance obligations within our contracts are satisfied within one year or less performance obligations satisfied beyond one year include those relating to a nonrefundable customer payment of 200 million received in june 2013 in return for the exclusive use of the smartdose ® technology platform within a specific therapeutic area as of december 31 2019 there was 56 million of unearned income related to this payment of which 09 million was included in other current liabilities and 47 million was included in other longterm 

liabilities the unearned income is being recognized as income on a straightline basis over the remaining term of the agreement the agreement does not include a future minimum purchase commitment from the customer 

our revenue can be generated from contracts with multiple performance obligations when a sales agreement involves multiple performance obligations each obligation is separately identified and the transaction price is allocated based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised good or service to the customer 

some customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes we record rebate costs when sales occur based on our assessment of the likelihood that the required volumes will be attained we also maintain an allowance for product returns as we believe that we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of returns based on our substantial historical experience 

contract assets and liabilities result from transactions with revenue recorded over time if the measure of remaining rights exceeds the measure of the remaining performance obligations we record a contract asset contract assets are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in accounts receivable net and other assets current and noncurrent portions respectively contract assets included in accounts receivable net relate to the unbilled amounts of our product sales for which we have recognized revenue over time contract assets included in other assets represent the remaining performance obligations of our development and tooling agreements conversely if the measure of the remaining performance obligations exceeds the measure of the remaining rights we record a contract liability contract liabilities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in other liabilities current and noncurrent portions respectively and represent cash payments received in advance of our performance 

impairment of longlived assets longlived assets including property plant and equipment and operating lease rightofuse assets are tested for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable an asset is considered impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future expected undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset once an asset is considered impaired an impairment loss is recorded within other income expense for the difference between the asset’s carrying value and its fair value for assets held and used in the business management determines fair value using estimated future cash flows to be derived from the asset discounted to a net present value using an appropriate discount rate for assets held for sale or for investment purposes management determines fair value by estimating the proceeds to be received upon sale of the asset less disposition costs 

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually following the completion of our annual budget and longrange planning process or whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is the same as or one level below our operating segments a goodwill impairment charge represents the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test such as future sales future cash flows and longterm growth rates are consistent with internal projections and operating plans amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test are also largely dependent on the continued sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products as well as our timeliness and success in newproduct innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems changes in the estimate of fair value including the estimate of future cash flows could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position accounting guidance also allows entities to first assess qualitative factors including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors and overall financial performance to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test we elected to follow this guidance for our 2017 2018 and 2019 annual impairment tests based upon our assessment we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was less than its carrying amount and determined that it was not necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment tests in 2017 2018 and 2019 

intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 

employee benefits we maintain funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans in the us and a number of other countries that cover employees who meet eligibility requirements in addition we sponsor postretirement benefit plans which provide healthcare benefits for eligible employees who retire or become disabled postretirement benefit plans are limited to only those active employees who met the eligibility requirements as of january 1 2017 the measurement of annual cost and obligations under these defined benefit postretirement plans is subject to a number of assumptions which are specific for each of our us and foreign plans the assumptions which are reviewed at least annually are relevant to both the plan assets where applicable and the obligation for benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees two of the most critical assumptions in determining pension and retiree medical plan expense are the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement age rates of compensation increases mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience for our funded plans we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our plan assets as well as historical and expected rates of return in estimating the longterm rate of return on plan assets under us gaap differences between actual and expected results are generally accumulated in other comprehensive income loss as actuarial gains or losses and subsequently amortized into earnings over future periods 

changes in key assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position we estimate that every 25basis point reduction in our longterm rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by 04 million and every 25basis point reduction in our discount rate would decrease pension expense by 01 million a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations our net pension underfunded balance at december 31 2019 was 438 million compared to 525 million at december 31 2018 our underfunded balance for other postretirement benefits was 66 million at december 31 2019 compared to 60 million at december 31 2018 

income taxes we estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation in addition deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates to tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of our assets and liabilities the enacted statutory tax rate applied is based on the rate expected to be applicable at the time of the forecasted utilization of the loss carryforward or reversal of the temporary difference valuation allowances on deferred tax assets are established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized the realizability of deferred tax assets is subject to our estimates of future taxable income generally at the respective subsidiary company and country level changes in tax legislation business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined 

when accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements we apply a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our ongoing business operations expose us to various risks such as fluctuating interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and increasing commodity prices these risk factors can impact our results of operations cash flows and financial position to manage these market risks we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps options and foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with and for notional amounts equal to or less than the related underlying exposures we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial 

instruments for investment or trading purposes all derivatives are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 

foreign currency exchange risk 

sales outside of the us accounted for 557 of our consolidated net sales in 2019 virtually all of these sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into usd for consolidated reporting purposes although the majority of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary they may also hold assets or liabilities denominated in other currencies these items may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains and losses as a result our results of operations and financial position are exposed to changing currency exchange rates we periodically use forward exchange contracts to hedge certain transactions or to manage monthend balance sheet exposures on crosscurrency intercompany loans 

we have entered into forward exchange contracts designated as fair value hedges to manage our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates on crosscurrency intercompany loans as of december 31 2019 the total amount of these forward exchange contracts was sgd 6015 million and 134 million as of december 31 2018 the total amount of these forward exchange contracts was €100 million sgd 6015 million and 134 million 

in addition we have entered into several foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges for periods of up to eighteen months intended to hedge the currency risk associated with a portion of our forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies as of december 31 2019 we had outstanding foreign currency contracts to purchase and sell certain pairs of currencies as follows 



in november and december 2019 in conjunction with the repayment of the outstanding longterm borrowings under our credit facility denominated in euro and yen we dedesignated these borrowings as hedges of our net investments in certain european subsidiaries and daikyo the amounts recorded as a cumulative translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to these borrowings prior to dedesignation will remain in accumulated other comprehensive loss indefinitely unless certain future events occur such as the disposition of the operations for which the net investment hedges relate 

in december 2019 in conjunction with the repayment of the outstanding longterm borrowings under our credit facility denominated in yen we entered into a forward exchange contract designated as a cash flow hedge to manage our exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates this forward exchange contract matured on december 30 2019 

in december 2019 we entered into a fiveyear floatingtofloating forwardstarting crosscurrency swap the “crosscurrency swap” for 90 million which we designated as a hedge of our net investment in daikyo the notional amount of the crosscurrency swap is ¥98 billion 90 million and the swap termination date is december 31 2024 under the crosscurrency swap we receive floating interest rate payments based on threemonth usd libor plus a margin in return for paying floating interest rate payments based on threemonth yen libor plus a margin 

interest rate risk 

as a result of our normal borrowing activities we have longterm debt with both fixed and variable interest rates longterm debt consists of our term loan and series a b and c notes 

the following table summarizes our interest rate risksensitive instruments excluding unamortized debt issuance costs 



commodity price risk 

many of our proprietary products are made from synthetic elastomers which are derived from the petroleum refining process we purchase the majority of our elastomers via longterm supply contracts some of which contain clauses that provide for surcharges related to fluctuations in crude oil prices in recent years raw material costs have fluctuated due to crude oil price fluctuations we expect this volatility to continue we will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects on gross profit 

from november 2017 through october 2019 we purchased several series of call options for a total of 352682 barrels of crude oil to mitigate our exposure to such oilbased surcharges and protect operating cash flows with regards to a portion of our forecasted elastomer purchases 

during 2019 the loss recorded in cost of goods and services sold related to these options was 04 million during 2018 the gain recorded in cost of goods and services sold related to these options was 01 million 

as of december 31 2019 we had outstanding contracts to purchase 135967 barrels of crude oil from january 2020 to june 2021 at a weightedaverage strike price of 7071 per barrel

none 




 item 9a  controls and procedures 

disclosure controls are controls and procedures designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the exchange act such as this annual report is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended is accumulated and communicated to our management including our ceo and chief financial officer “cfo” or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our disclosure controls include some but not all components of our internal control over financial reporting 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our ceo and cfo of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this form 10k based on this evaluation our ceo and cfo have concluded that as of december 31 2019 our disclosure controls and procedures are effective 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our ceo and cfo to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2019 based on the framework established in “internal controlintegrated framework 2013” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2019 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within west have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls 

may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2019 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein 

changes in internal controls 

during the fourth quarter ended december 31 2019 there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

on january 1 2019 we adopted asc 842 although our adoption of asc 842 resulted in no change to our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting we did implement changes to our internal controls relating to leases these changes included the development of new policies enhanced contract review requirements and other ongoing monitoring activities these controls were designed to provide assurance at a reasonable level of the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures

international 

we have significant operations outside of the united states “us” which are managed through the same business segments as our us operations – proprietary products and contractmanufactured products sales outside of the us accounted for 554  of our consolidated net sales in 2018  for a geographic breakdown of sales please refer to note 18 segment information  please refer to item 2 properties  for additional information on our manufacturing and other sites 

although the general business processes are similar to the domestic business international operations are exposed to additional risks these risks include currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar “usd” multiple tax jurisdictions and particularly in south america israel and the middle east political and social issues that could destabilize local markets and affect the demand for our products 

see further discussion of our international operations the risks associated with our international operations and our attempt to minimize some of these risks in part i item 1a risk factors  part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resources part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  note 1   under the captions financial instruments  and foreign currency translation and note 10 derivative financial instruments  

raw materials 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers aluminum and plastic elastomers include both natural and synthetic materials we currently have access to adequate supplies of these raw materials to meet our production needs through agreements with suppliers 

we employ a supply chain management strategy in our business segments which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply due to regulatory control over our production processes and the cost and time involved in qualifying suppliers we rely on singlesource suppliers for many critical raw materials we purchase certain raw materials in the open market this strategy increases the risk that our supply chain may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production or distribution problem these risks are managed where possible by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites rigorous quality control systems surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in case of an interruption in production or distribution 

intellectual property 

intellectual property including patents trade secrets and knowhow is important to our business we own or license intellectual property rights including issued patents and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries that relate to various aspects of our products in 2018 more than 120 patents were issued to west across the globe some key valueadded and proprietary products and processes are licensed from daikyo our intellectual property rights have been useful in establishing our market position and in the growth of our business and are expected to continue to be of value in the future 

seasonality 

our business is not inherently seasonal 

working capital 

we are required to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet customer requirements in addition some of our supply agreements require us to purchase inventory in bulk orders which increases inventory levels but decreases the risk of supply interruption for a more detailed discussion of working capital please refer to the discussion in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resource s 

marketing 

our proprietary products customers include most of the major biologic generic and pharmaceutical drug companies in the world which incorporate our components and other offerings into their products for distribution to the point of care and ultimate enduser  the patient 

our contractmanufactured products customers include many of the world’s largest pharmaceutical diagnostic and medical device companies contractmanufactured products components generally are incorporated into our customers’ manufacturing lines for further processing or assembly 

our products and services are sold and distributed primarily through our own sales force and distribution network with limited use of contract sales agents and regional distributors 

our ten largest customers accounted for 371  of our consolidated net sales in 2018  but none of these customers individually accounted for more than 10 of consolidated net sales please refer to note 3 revenue  and note 18 segment information  for additional information on our consolidated net sales 

order backlog 

order backlog includes firm orders placed by customers for manufacture over a period of time according to their schedule or upon confirmation by the customer we also have contractual arrangements with a number of our 

customers products covered by these contracts are included in our backlog only as orders are received order backlog may be positively or negatively impacted by several factors including customer ordering patterns and the necessary leadtime to deliver customer orders order backlog is one of many measures we use to understand future demand and should not be considered in isolation to predict future sales growth 

at december 31 2018  and 2017  the order backlog for proprietary products was 4073 million and 3774 million respectively the majority of the order backlog for proprietary products at december 31 2018  is expected to be filled during 2019 

the majority of contractmanufactured products manufacturing activity is governed by contractual volume expectations subject to periodic revisions based on customer requirements 

competition 

with our range of proprietary technologies we compete with several companies across our proprietary products product lines due to the special nature of our pharmaceutical packaging components and our longstanding participation in the market competition for these components is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive costcontrol programs across their operations 

in addition there are a number of competitors supplying medical devices and medical device components including a number of pharmaceutical manufacturers who are also potential customers of our medical devices we compete in this market on the basis of our reputation for quality and reliability in engineering and project management as well as our knowledge of and experience in compliance with regulatory requirements 

we have specialized knowledge of container closure components which is integral to developing delivery systems with our range of proprietary technologies we compete with new and established companies in the area of drug delivery devices including suppliers of prefillable syringes autoinjectors safety needles and other proprietary systems 

we differentiate ourselves from our competition by serving as an integrated drug containment and delivery systems global supplier that can provide preapproval primary packaging support and engineering development analytical services regulatory expertise and aftersale technical support customers also appreciate the global scope of our manufacturing capability and our ability to produce many products at multiple sites 

our contractmanufactured products business operates in very competitive markets for its products the competition varies from smaller regional companies to large global molders given the cost pressures they face many of our customers look to reduce costs by sourcing from lowcost locations we differentiate ourselves by leveraging our global capabilities and by employing new technologies such as highspeed automated assembly insertmolding multishot precision molding and expertise with multiplepiece closure systems 

research and development activities 

we maintain our own researchscale production facilities and laboratories for developing new products and offer contract engineering design and development services to assist customers with new product development our quality control regulatory and laboratory testing capabilities are used to ensure compliance with applicable manufacturing and regulatory standards for primary and secondary pharmaceutical packaging components and delivery systems 

commercial development of our new products and services for medical and pharmaceutical applications commonly requires several years new products that we develop may require separate approval as medical devices and products that are intended to be used in the packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical products are subject to both customer acceptance of our products and regulatory approval of the customer’s products following our development period 

we expect that research and development spending will continue to increase as we pursue innovative strategic platforms in prefillable syringes injectable containers advanced injection and safety and administration systems 

we also continue to seek new innovative opportunities for acquisition licensing partnering or development of products services and technologies that serve the injectable drug containment and delivery market 

we spent 403 million  in 2018  391 million  in 2017  and 368 million  in 2016  on research and development all of which related to proprietary products 

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows there were no required material capital expenditures for environmental controls in our facilities in 2018  and there are currently no needed or planned material expenditures for 2019 

employees 

as of december 31 2018  we employed approximately 7700  people in our operations throughout the world including approximately 7600  fulltime employees

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 

the current uncertainty in the global economy including the effects of recession or slow economic growth in the us europe and emerging markets in asia and south america may negatively affect our operating results examples of the effects of these global economic challenges include our suppliers’ and our customers’ inability to access the credit markets at commercially reasonable rates reduction in sales due to customers decreasing their inventories in the nearterm or longterm or due to liquidity difficulties reduction in sales due to shortages of materials we purchase from our suppliers reduction in research and development efforts and expenditures by our customers our inability to hedge our currency and raw material risks sufficiently or at commercially reasonable prices insolvency of suppliers or customers inflationary pressures on our supplies or our products and increased expenses due to growing global taxation of corporate profits or revenues our operating results in one or more geographic regions may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region if economic and market conditions in the us or europe or in emerging markets weaken further we may experience material adverse impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our sales and profitability are largely dependent on the sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products if the products developed by our customers in the future use another delivery system our sales and profitability could suffer 

our business depends to a substantial extent on customers’ continued sales and development of products that are delivered by injection if our customers fail to continue to sell develop and deploy injectable products or we are unable to develop new products that assist in the delivery of drugs by alternative methods our sales and profitability may suffer 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

our business is subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations sales outside of the us accounted for 554  of our consolidated net sales in 2018  and we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to 

represent a significant portion of our total sales in the future in addition many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the us further we intend to continue our expansion into emerging andor fastergrowing markets outside of the us in the future virtually all of our international sales assets and related operating costs and expenses are earned valued or incurred in the currency of the local country primarily the euro the singapore dollar “sgd” and the danish krone in addition we are exposed to japanese yen “yen” as we maintain a 25 ownership interest in and we purchase finished goods and other materials from daikyo we are also exposed to currencies in emerging market countries such as the chinese yuan the indian rupee and various south american currencies our consolidated financial statements are presented in usd and therefore we must translate the reported values of our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses into usd which can result in significant fluctuations in the amount of those assets liabilities revenues or expenses the exchange rates between these foreign currencies and usd in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future increases or decreases in the value of usd compared to these foreign currencies may negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

in addition to translation risks we incur currency transaction risk when we or one of our subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction in a currency other than that entity’s local currency in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in certain exchange rates we have entered and expect to continue to enter into hedging arrangements including the use of financial derivatives there can be no certainty that we will be able to enter into or maintain hedges of these currency risks or that our hedges will be effective which could have a significant effect on our financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to provide comparative value advantages timely fulfill customer orders or resist pricing pressure we will have to reduce our prices which may reduce our profit margins 

we compete with several companies across our major product lines because of the special nature of these products competition is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive costcontrol programs across their operations companies often compete on the basis of price we aim to differentiate ourselves from our competition by being a “fullservice valueadded” global supplier that is able to provide presale compatibility studies engineering support and other services and sophisticated postsale technical support on a global basis however we face continued pricing pressure from our customers and competitors if we are unable to resist or to offset the effects of continued pricing pressure through our valueadded services improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures or if we have to reduce our prices our sales and profitability may suffer 

consolidation in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries have experienced a significant amount of consolidation as a result of this consolidation competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased in addition group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has placed pricing pressure on suppliers further consolidation within the industries we serve could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products 

we are subject to regulation by governments around the world and if these regulations are not complied with existing and future operations may be curtailed and we could be subject to liability 

the design development manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our products and our customers’ products that incorporate our products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the us europe and other countries including the us food and drug administration “fda” the european medicines agency and the national medical products administration china complying with governmental regulation can be costly and can result in required modification or withdrawal of existing products and a substantial delay in the introduction of new products failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or failure to obtain regulatory approval for 

a new product could result in expenses and actions that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

products that incorporate our technologies and medical devices that we produce are subject to regulations and extensive approval or clearance processes which make the timing and success of newproduct commercialization difficult to predict 

the process of obtaining and maintaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is expensive and timeconsuming historically most medical devices that incorporate our technologies and medical devices that we produce have been subject to the fda’s 510k marketing approval process which typically lasts from six to nine months supplemental or full premarket approval reviews require a significantly longer period delaying commercialization changes in regulation on a global scale must be monitored and actions taken to ensure ongoing compliance pharmaceutical products that incorporate our technologies and medical devices that we produce are subject to the fda’s new drug application process which typically takes a number of years to complete additionally biotechnology products that incorporate our technologies and medical devices that we produce are subject to the fda’s biologics license application process which also typically takes a number of years to complete outside of the us sales of medical devices and pharmaceutical or biotechnology products are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary from country to country the time required to obtain approval for sale internationally may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval there is no certainty that any regulatory approval may be obtained or maintained indefinitely and our ability to launch products on to the market and maintain market presence is not guaranteed 

changes in the regulation of drug products and devices may increase competitive pressure and adversely affect our business 

an effect of the governmental regulation of our medical devices and our customers’ drug products devices and manufacturing processes is that compliance with regulations makes it difficult to change components and devices produced by one supplier with those from another supplier due to the large amount of data and information that customers must generate to demonstrate that the components and devices are equivalent and pose no additional risk to the patient the regulation of our medical devices and our customers’ products that incorporate our components and devices has increased over time if the applicable regulations were to be modified in a way that reduced the level of data and information needed to prove equivalency for a change from one supplier’s components or devices to those made by another it is likely that the competitive pressure would increase and adversely affect our sales and profitability 

if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights our ability to compete may be affected 

our patents trademarks and other intellectual property are important to our business we rely on patent trademark copyright trade secret and other intellectual property laws as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary products information technologies and processes we also have obligations with respect to the nonuse and nondisclosure of thirdparty intellectual property we may need to engage in litigation or similar activities to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others any such litigation could require us to expend significant resources and divert the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel from our business operations there can be no assurance that the steps we will take to prevent misappropriation infringement or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of others will be successful in addition effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for some of our proprietary products in some countries failure to protect our intellectual property or successfully invalidate or defend against intellectual property protections of third parties could harm our business and results of operations in addition if relevant and effective patent protection is not available or has expired we may not be able to prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar or duplicative to ours 

disruption in our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make and sell products and have a negative impact on our reputation performance or financial condition 

we have manufacturing sites throughout the world in some instances however the manufacturing of certain product lines is concentrated in one or only a few of our plants the functioning of our manufacturing and distribution assets and systems could be disrupted for reasons either within or beyond our control including without limitation extreme weather or longerterm climatic changes natural disasters pandemic war accidental damage disruption to the supply of material or services product quality and safety issues systems failure workforce actions or environmental contamination there is a risk that incident management systems in place may prove inadequate and that any disruption may materially adversely affect our ability to make and sell products and therefore materially adversely affect our reputation performance or financial condition 

the medical technology industry is very competitive and customer demands andor new products in the marketplace could cause a reduction in demand 

the medical technology industry is subject to rapid technological changes and we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold we face this competition from a wide range of companies including large medical device companies some of which have greater financial and marketing resources than we do we also face competition from firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets in some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for diseases that may be delivered via their own or without a medical device the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology may reduce customer demand for our products or render some of our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive in addition any failure or inability to meet increased customer quality expectations could cause a reduction in demand 

significant developments in us policies could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

changes in us social political regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development immigration and investment could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that vary by country and which could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

we conduct business in most of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world our international operations and our ability to implement our overall business strategy including our plan to continue expanding into emerging andor fastergrowing markets outside of the us are subject to risks and uncertainties that can vary by country and include transportation delays and interruptions political and economic instability and disruptions including the united kingdom’s referendum on withdrawal from the european union imposition of duties and tariffs import and export controls the risks of divergent business expectations or cultural incompatibility inherent in establishing and maintaining operations in foreign countries difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations labor strikes andor disputes and potentially adverse tax consequences limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies with third parties or our joint venture partners outside of the us could also create exposure in addition we may not be able to operate in compliance with foreign laws and regulations or comply with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject in the event that these laws or regulations change any of these events could have an adverse effect on our international operations in the future by reducing the demand for our products or decreasing the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

disruptions in the supply of key raw materials could adversely impact our operations 

we generally purchase our raw materials and supplies required for the production of our products in the open market for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability or cost effectiveness many components and raw materials are available andor purchased only from a single supplier due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for these components or materials or do so without excessive cost as a result a reduction or interruption in supply or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

unauthorized access to our or our customers ’  information and systems could negatively impact our business 

our systems and networks as well as those of our customers suppliers service providers and banks have and may in the future become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches which in turn could result in the unauthorized release and misuse of confidential or proprietary information about our company our employees or our customers as well as disrupt our operations or damage our facilities or those of third parties additionally our systems are subject to regulation to preserve the privacy of certain data held on those systems we maintain an extensive network of technical security controls policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems in order to address these threats while these measures are designed to prevent detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems certain types of attacks could result in financial or information losses andor reputational harm if we cannot comply with regulations or prevent the unauthorized access release andor corruption of our or our customers confidential classified or personally identifiable information our reputation could be damaged andor we could face financial losses we may also be required to incur additional costs to modify or enhance our systems or to try to prevent or remediate any such attacks modifying or enhancing our systems may result in unanticipated or prolonged disruption events which could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

raw material and energy prices have a significant impact on our profitability if raw material andor energy prices increase and we cannot pass those price increases on to our customers our profitability and financial condition may suffer 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers which include synthetic and natural material aluminum and plastic in addition our manufacturing facilities consume a wide variety of energy products to fuel heat and cool our operations supply and demand factors which are beyond our control generally affect the price of our raw materials and utility costs if we are unable to pass along increased raw material prices and energy costs to our customers our profitability and thus our financial condition may be adversely affected the prices of many of these raw materials and utilities are cyclical and volatile for example the prices of certain commodities particularly petroleumbased raw materials have in the recent past exhibited rapid changes affecting the cost of synthetic elastomers and plastic while we generally attempt to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of sales price increases historically there has been a time delay between raw material andor energy price increases and our ability to increase the prices of our products in some circumstances we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pressure and other factors 

if we are not timely or successful in newproduct innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems our future revenues and operating income could be adversely affected 

our growth partly depends on newproduct innovation and the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications product development and commercialization is inherently uncertain and is subject to a number of factors outside of our control including any necessary regulatory approvals and commercial acceptance for the products the ultimate timing and successful commercialization of new products and systems requires substantial evaluations of the functional operational clinical and economic viability of our products in addition the timely and adequate availability of filling capacity is essential to both conducting definitive stability trials and the timing of commercialization of customers’ products in cz vials syringes and cartridges delays interruptions or failures in developing and commercializing newproduct 

innovations or proprietary multicomponent systems could adversely affect future revenues and operating income in addition adverse conditions may also result in future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we may not succeed in finding and completing acquisition or other strategic transactions which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we have historically engaged in acquisition activity and we may in the future engage in acquisitions or other strategic transactions such as joint ventures or investments in other entities we may be unable to identify suitable targets opportunistic or otherwise for acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future if we identify a suitable candidate our ability to successfully implement the strategic transaction would depend on a variety of factors including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and to comply with the restrictions contained in our debt agreements strategic transactions involve risks including those associated with integrating the operations or maintaining the operations as separate as applicable financial reporting disparate technologies and personnel of acquired companies joint ventures or related companies managing geographically dispersed operations or other strategic investments the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience the potential loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies joint ventures or companies in which we may make strategic investments and potentially other unknown risks we may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire or strategically develop in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits relating to any such strategic transactions strategic transactions may be expensive time consuming and may strain our resources strategic transactions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of among other things the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill additional carrying costs of patent or trademark portfolios and amortization expenses of other intangible assets in addition strategic transactions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities 

product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 

the design manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical packaging and medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects unanticipated use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market a recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals 

our operations must comply with environmental statutes and regulations and any failure to comply could result in extensive costs which would harm our business 

the manufacture of some of our products involves the use transportation storage and disposal of hazardous or toxic materials and is subject to various environmental protection and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate this has exposed us in the past and could expose us in the future to risks of accidental contamination and events of noncompliance with environmental laws any such occurrences could result in regulatory enforcement or personal injury and property damage claims or could lead to a shutdown of some of our operations which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations we currently incur costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations and these costs may become more significant 

a loss of key personnel or highly skilled employees could disrupt our operations 

our future success depends in large part on our ability to retain key employees including our executive officers individuals in technical marketing sales and research positions competition for experienced employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees our business could be adversely affected although we believe that we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise our inability to do so on a timely basis could disrupt the operations of the unit affected or our overall operations in addition because of the complex nature of many of our products and programs we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled engineering staff and workforce our operations could be disrupted by a shortage of available skilled employees 

the uncertain effects of potential climate change legislation could lead to significantly increased costs 

if legislation or regulations are enacted or promulgated in the us europe or asia or any other jurisdictions in which we do business that limit or reduce allowable greenhouse gas emissions and other emissions such restrictions could have a significant effect on our operating and financial decisions including those involving capital expenditures to reduce emissions and our results of operations our manufacturing operations may not be able to operate as planned if we are not able to comply with new legal and regulatory legislation around climate change or it may become too costly to operate in a profitable manner additionally suppliers’ added expenses could be passed on to us in the form of higher prices and we may not be able to pass on such expenses to our customers through price increases 

healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in the us or international healthcare systems including the patient protection and affordable care act the “ppaca” could result in reduced demand for our products as our sales depend in part on the extent to which pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities private insurers and other thirdparty payers for the costs of our products the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers which can vary among public and private sources may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these products in a particular jurisdiction legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the us including the possible termination of the ppaca and potential replacement thereafter with a different system or abroad for example those under consideration in france germany italy and the united kingdom could significantly reduce reimbursement for our customers’ products which could in turn reduce the demand for our products 

moreover in the coming years additional changes could be made to global governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our products we will continue to evaluate the ppaca as amended the implementation of regulations or guidance related to various provisions of the ppaca by federal agencies the potential repeal and replacement of the ppaca as well as trends and changes that may be encouraged by the legislation and other healthcare legislation globally and that may potentially impact our business over time 

no assurance can be given that we will continue to pay or declare dividends 

we have historically paid dividends however there can be no assurance that we will pay or declare dividends in the future the actual declaration and payment of future dividends the amount of any such dividends and the establishment of record and payment dates if any are subject to determination by our board of directors each quarter after its review of our thencurrent strategy applicable debt covenants and financial performance and position among other things our declaration and payment of future dividends is subject to risks and uncertainties including deterioration of our financial performance or position inability to declare a dividend in compliance with applicable laws or debt covenants an increase in our cash needs or decrease in available cash and the business judgment of the board of directors that a declaration of a dividend is not in our best interest 

our results of operations and earnings may not meet guidance or expectations    

we provide public guidance on our expected results of operations for future periods this guidance is comprised of forwardlooking statements subject to risks and uncertainties including the risks and uncertainties described in this form 10k and in our other public filings and public statements and is based necessarily on assumptions we make at the time we provide such guidance our guidance may not always be accurate if in the future our results of operations for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or if we reduce our guidance for future periods the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 

we are exposed to credit risk on accounts receivable and certain prepayments made in the normal course of business this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

a substantial majority of our outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance in addition we have made prepayments associated with insurance premiums and other advances in the normal course of business while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on trade receivables and other current assets there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk and avoid losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

if we fail to comply with our obligations under our distributorship or license agreements with daikyo the agreements are terminated early or we are unable to renew these agreements on the same or substantially similar terms we could lose license rights that are important to our business 

key valueadded and proprietary products and processes are licensed from our affiliate daikyo including but not limited to cz flurotec ®  and b2coating technologies our rights to these products and processes are licensed pursuant to agreements that expire in 2027 however if the agreements are terminated early our business could be adversely impacted

percentages in the following tables and throughout this results of operations  section may reflect rounding adjustments 

net sales 

the following table presents net sales consolidated and by reportable segment 



2018 compared to 2017 

consolidated net sales increased by 1183 million  or 74  in 2018  including a favorable  foreign currency translation impact of 286 million excluding foreign currency translation effects consolidated net sales increased  by 897 million or 56 

proprietary products – proprietary products net sales increased  by 717 million  or 58  in 2018  including a favorable  foreign currency translation impact of 238 million excluding foreign currency translation effects net sales increased  by 479 million or 39 as growth in our highvalue product offerings including our westar ®  and fluroteccoated components our readytouse seals stoppers and plungers and our novapure ®  products as well as sales price increases partially offset the impact of the voluntary recall of vial2bag products and the deconsolidation of our venezuelan subsidiary as of april 1 2017 

contractmanufactured products –  contractmanufactured products net sales increased  by 466 million  or 129  in 2018  including a favorable  foreign currency translation impact of 48 million excluding foreign currency translation effects net sales increased  by 418 million or 116 despite the impact of the loss of a consumerproduct customer in early 2018 higher sales volume particularly in ireland contributed 104 percentage points of the increase and sales price increases contributed 12 percentage points of the increase 

2017 compared to 2016 

consolidated net sales increased  by 900 million  or 60  in 2017  including a favorable  foreign currency translation impact of 122 million  excluding foreign currency translation effects consolidated net sales increased  by 778 million  or 52  

proprietary products – proprietary products net sales increased  by 470 million  or 39  in 2017  including a favorable  foreign currency translation impact of 84 million  excluding foreign currency translation effects net sales increased  by 386 million  or 32  proprietary products sales growth in 2017 was slower than in 2016 

as customers continued to work down inventory purchased in 2016 mostly to address long production leadtimes for

net cash used in investing activities   

2018 compared to 2017

2017 compared to 2016 

net cash used in investing activities decreased by 422 million in 2017 mostly due to a 394 million decrease in capital spending due to the completion of several major projects including certain components of our new facility in waterford ireland

liquidity and capital resources 

the table below presents selected liquidity and capital measures as of 



cash and cash equivalents include all instruments that have maturities of ninety days or less when purchased working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents and total invested capital is defined as the sum of net debt and total equity net debt and total invested capital are nonus gaap financial measures that should not be used as a substitute for the comparable us gaap financial measures the nonus gaap financial measures are incorporated into our discussion and analysis as management believes that this information provides users with a valuable insight into our overall performance and financial position 

cash and cash equivalents –  our cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2018  consisted of cash held in depository accounts with banks around the world and cash invested in highquality shortterm investments the cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2018  included 1746 million of cash held by subsidiaries within the us and 1628 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the us in response to the 2017 tax act we reevaluated our position regarding permanent reinvestment of foreign subsidiary earnings and profits through 2017 with the exception of china and mexico and decided that those profits were no longer permanently reinvested as of january 1 2018 we reasserted indefinite reinvestment related to all post2017 unremitted earnings in all of our foreign subsidiaries in general it is our practice and intention to permanently reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and repatriate earnings only when the tax impact is de minimis and that position has not changed subsequent to the onetime transition tax under the 2017 tax act except as noted above accordingly no deferred taxes have been provided for withholding taxes or other taxes that would result upon repatriation of approximately 797 million  of undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries to the us as those earnings continue to be permanently reinvested further it is impracticable for us to estimate any future tax costs for any unrecognized deferred tax liabilities associated with our indefinite reinvestment assertion because the actual tax liability if any would be dependent on complex analysis and calculations considering various tax laws exchange rates circumstances existing when there is a repatriation sale or liquidation or other factors 

working capital   working capital at december 31 2018   increased  by 1467 million  or 316  as compared to december 31 2017  including a decrease of 165 million due to foreign currency translation excluding the impact of currency exchange rates cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable inventories and total current liabilities increased by 1071 million 438 million 70 million and 113 million respectively the increase in accounts receivable was due to increased sales activity longer customer payment terms and our adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance the increase in current liabilities was due to an increase in accrued salaries wages and benefits 

debt and credit facilities   the 09 million decrease in total debt at december 31 2018  as compared to december 31 2017  primarily resulted from foreign currency rate fluctuations 

our sources of liquidity include our credit facility at december 31 2018 we had 286 million  in outstanding longterm borrowings under this facility of which 46 million  was denominated in yen and 240 million  was denominated in euro these borrowings together with outstanding letters of credit of 25 million  resulted in a borrowing capacity available under our credit facility of 2689 million  at december 31 2018 we do not expect 

any significant limitations on our ability to access this source of funds please refer to note 9 debt  for further discussion of our credit facility 

pursuant to the financial covenants in our debt agreements we are required to maintain established interest coverage ratios and to not exceed established leverage ratios in addition the agreements contain other customary covenants none of which we consider restrictive to our operations at december 31 2018  we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements throughout 2019 

we believe that cash on hand and cash generated from operations together with availability under our credit facility will be adequate to address our foreseeable liquidity needs based on our current expectations of our business operations capital expenditures and scheduled payments of debt obligations 

commitments and contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our commitments and contractual obligations at december 31 2018  these obligations are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity 



 

 

 

 

reserves for uncertain tax positions   the table above does not include 39 million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2018  due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for amounts which may be paid 

letters of credit   we have letters of credit totaling 25 million  supporting the reimbursement of workers’ compensation and other claims paid on our behalf by insurance carriers our accrual for insurance obligations was 

34 million  at december 31 2018  of which 09 million  is in excess of our deductible and therefore is reimbursable by the insurance company 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2018  we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases unconditional purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business and outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with us gaap the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions some of which are subjective and complex that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our results of operations and financial position 

revenue recognition  our revenue results from the sale of goods or services and reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services we record revenue based on a fivestep model in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” topic 606 “asc 606” following the identification of a contract with a customer we identify the performance obligations goods or services in the contract determine the transaction price allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and recognize the revenue when or as we satisfy the performance obligations by transferring the promised goods or services to our customers a good or service is transferred when or as the customer obtains control of that good or service 

we recognize the majority of our revenue primarily relating to proprietary products product sales at a point in time following the transfer of control of our products to our customers which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the related agreements 

we recognize revenue relating to our contractmanufactured products product sales and certain proprietary products product sales over time as our performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to us and we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date 

we recognize revenue relating to our development and tooling agreements over time as our performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced 

for revenue recognized over time revenue is recognized by applying a method of measuring progress toward complete satisfaction of the related performance obligation when selecting the method for measuring progress we select the method that best depicts the transfer of control of goods or services promised to our customers 

revenue for our contractmanufactured products product sales certain proprietary products product sales and our development and tooling agreements is recorded under an input method which recognizes revenue on the basis of our efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation for example resources consumed labor hours expended costs incurred time elapsed or machine hours used relative to the total expected inputs to the satisfaction of that performance obligation the input method that we use is based on costs incurred 

the majority of the performance obligations within our contracts are satisfied within one year or less performance obligations satisfied beyond one year include those relating to a nonrefundable customer payment of 200 million  received in june 2013 in return for the exclusive use of the smartdose ®  technology platform within a specific therapeutic area as of december 31 2018  there was 65 million  of unearned income related to this payment of which 09 million  was included in other current liabilities and 56 million  was included in other longterm liabilities the unearned income is being recognized as income on a straightline basis over the remaining term of the agreement the agreement does not include a future minimum purchase commitment from the customer 

our revenue can be generated from contracts with multiple performance obligations when a sales agreement involves multiple performance obligations each obligation is separately identified and the transaction price is allocated based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised good or service to the customer 

some customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes we record rebate costs when sales occur based on our assessment of the likelihood that the required volumes will be attained we also maintain an allowance for product returns as we believe that we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of returns based on our substantial historical experience 

contract assets or liabilities result from transactions with revenue recorded over time if the measure of remaining rights exceeds the measure of the remaining performance obligations we record a contract asset contract assets are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in accounts receivable net and other assets current and noncurrent portions respectively contract assets included in accounts receivable net relate to the unbilled amounts of our product sales for which we have recognized revenue over time contract assets included in other assets represent the remaining performance obligations of our development and tooling agreements conversely if the measure of the remaining performance obligations exceeds the measure of the remaining rights we record a contract liability contract liabilities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in other liabilities current and noncurrent portions respectively and represent cash payments received in advance of our performance 

impairment of longlived assets longlived assets including property plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable an asset is considered impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future expected undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset once an asset is considered impaired an impairment loss is recorded within other income expense for the difference between the asset’s carrying value and its fair value for assets held and used in the business management determines fair value using estimated future cash flows to be derived from the asset discounted to a net present value using an appropriate discount rate for assets held for sale or for investment purposes management determines fair value by estimating the proceeds to be received upon sale of the asset less disposition costs during 2018 as part of our 2018 restructuring plan we recorded within other expense a 22 million noncash asset writedown associated with the discontinued use of certain equipment during 2016 as part of our 2016 restructuring plan we recorded within other expense a 45 million noncash asset writedown associated with the discontinued use of certain equipment 

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually following the completion of our annual budget and longrange planning process or whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is the same as or one level below our operating segments in january 2017 the fasb issued guidance which removes the second step of the goodwill impairment test a goodwill impairment charge will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2019 early adoption is permitted we adopted this guidance as of january 1 2017 on a prospective basis considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test such as future sales future cash flows and longterm growth rates are consistent with internal projections and operating plans amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test are also largely dependent on the continued sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products as well as our timeliness and success in newproduct innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems changes in the estimate of fair value including the estimate of future cash flows could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position recent accounting guidance also allows entities to first assess qualitative factors including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors and overall financial performance to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test as each of our reporting units had a fair value in excess of its carrying value of at least 180 within our 2016 annual impairment test we elected to follow this guidance for our 2017 and 2018 annual impairment tests based upon our assessment we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting 

units was less than its carrying amount and determined that it was not necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment tests in 2017 and 2018 

at december 31 2015 a trademark had been determined to have an indefinite life and therefore was not subject to amortization during 2016 as part of our 2016 restructuring plan we recorded within other expense a 100 million noncash asset writedown associated with the discontinued use of this trademark 

intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable during 2016 as part of our 2016 restructuring plan we recorded within other expense a 28 million noncash asset writedown associated with the discontinued use of a patent 

employee benefits  we maintain funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans in the us and a number of other countries that cover employees who meet eligibility requirements in addition we sponsor postretirement benefit plans which provide healthcare benefits for eligible employees who retire or become disabled the measurement of annual cost and obligations under these defined benefit postretirement plans is subject to a number of assumptions which are specific for each of our us and foreign plans the assumptions which are reviewed at least annually are relevant to both the plan assets where applicable and the obligation for benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees two of the most critical assumptions in determining pension and retiree medical plan expense are the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement age rates of compensation increases mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience for our funded plans we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our plan assets as well as historical and expected rates of return in estimating the longterm rate of return on plan assets under us gaap differences between actual and expected results are generally accumulated in other comprehensive income loss as actuarial gains or losses and subsequently amortized into earnings over future periods 

changes in key assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position we estimate that every 25basis point reduction in our longterm rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by 05 million and every 25basis point reduction in our discount rate would increase pension expense by 05 million a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations our net pension underfunded balance at december 31 2018  was 525 million compared to 485 million at december 31 2017  our underfunded balance for other postretirement benefits was 60 million at december 31 2018  compared to 71 million at december 31 2017  

income taxes  we estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation in addition deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established to recognize differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities we maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized the recoverability of tax assets is subject to our estimates of future profitability generally at the respective subsidiary company and country level changes in tax legislation business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined 

  

when accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements we apply a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return

sales outside of the us accounted for 554  of our consolidated net sales in 2018  virtually all of these sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into usd for consolidated reporting purposes although the majority of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary they may also hold assets or liabilities denominated in other currencies these items may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains and losses as a result our results of operations and financial position are exposed to changing currency exchange rates we periodically use forward exchange contracts to hedge certain transactions or to manage monthend balance sheet exposures on crosscurrency intercompany loans 

we have designated our €210 million  eurodenominated borrowings under our credit facility as a hedge of our net investment in certain european subsidiaries we also have ¥5000 million  in yendenominated borrowings under our credit facility which has been designated as a hedge of our net investment in daikyo at december 31 2018  a cumulative foreign currency translation loss on these hedges of 04 million  net of tax of 02 million  was recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss 

interest rate risk    

as a result of our normal borrowing activities we have longterm debt with both fixed and variable interest rates longterm debt consists of senior notes and revolving credit facilities our exposures to fluctuations in interest rates are managed to the extent considered necessary by entering into interest rate swap agreements 

the following table summarizes our interest rate risksensitive instruments excluding unamortized debt issuance cost 



commodity price risk 

many of our proprietary products are made from synthetic elastomers which are derived from the petroleum refining process we purchase the majority of our elastomers via longterm supply contracts some of which contain clauses that provide for surcharges related to fluctuations in crude oil prices in recent years raw material costs have 

fluctuated due to crude oil price fluctuations we expect this volatility to continue we will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects on gross profit 

in november 2016 we purchased a series of call options for a total of 96525  barrels of crude oil to mitigate our exposure to such oilbased surcharges and protect operating cash flows with regards to a portion of our forecasted elastomer purchases through november 2017 in november 2017 we purchased a series of call options for a total of 125166  barrels of crude oil through may 2019 in april 2018 we purchased a series of call options for a total of 30612  barrels of crude oil from december 2018 through august 2019 

during 2018 the gain recorded in cost of goods and services sold related to these options was 01 million  during 2017 the loss recorded in cost of goods and services sold related to these options was 03 million  

as of december 31 2018 we had outstanding contracts to purchase 47445  barrels of crude oil from january 2019 to august 2019 at a weightedaverage strike price of 7645  per barrel

none 




 item 9a  controls and procedures 

disclosure controls are controls and procedures designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the exchange act such as this annual report is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended is accumulated and communicated to our management including our ceo and chief financial officer “cfo” or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our disclosure controls include some but not all components of our internal control over financial reporting 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our ceo and cfo of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this form 10k based on this evaluation our ceo and cfo have concluded that as of december 31 2018  our disclosure controls and procedures are effective 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our ceo and cfo to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2018  based on the framework established in “internal controlintegrated framework 2013” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2018  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within west have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2018  has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein 

changes in internal controls 

during the fourth quarter ended december 31 2018  there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

on january 1 2018 we adopted asc 606 although our adoption of asc 606 resulted in no change to our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting we did implement changes to our internal controls relating to revenue these changes included the development of new policies based on a fivestep model provided in asc 606 enhanced contract review requirements and other ongoing monitoring activities these controls were designed to provide assurance at a reasonable level of the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures

the company was incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania on july 27 1923 

business segments 

our business operations are organized into two reportable segments proprietary products and contractmanufactured products 

proprietary products segment 

our proprietary products reportable segment offers proprietary packaging containment and drug delivery products along with analytical lab services to biologic generic and pharmaceutical drug customers our packaging products include stoppers and seals for injectable packaging systems which are designed to help ensure drug compatibility and stability with active drug products while also supporting operational efficiency for customers this product portfolio also includes syringe and cartridge components including custom solutions for the specific needs of injectable drug applications as well as administration systems that can enhance the safe delivery of drugs through advanced reconstitution mixing and transfer technologies we also provide films coatings washing and sterilization processes and services to enhance the quality of packaging components and mitigate the risk of contamination and compatibility issues 

this segments product portfolio also includes drug containment solutions including cz a cyclic olefin polymer in the form of vials syringes and cartridges these products can provide a highquality solution to glass incompatibility issues and can stand up to cold storage environments while reducing the risk of breakage that exists with glass in addition we offer a variety of selfinjection devices designed to address the need to provide athome delivery of injectable therapies these devices are patientcentric technologies that are easytouse and can be combined with connected health technologies that have the potential to increase adherence 

analytical lab services completes the product offerings in the proprietary products reportable segment this group provides specialized testing for drug packaging devices and administration systems offering the combination of primary packaging components containment solutions and drug delivery devices as well as analytical lab services helps to position us as the leader in the integrated containment and delivery of injectable medicines 

this reportable segment has manufacturing facilities in north and south america europe and asia pacific with affiliated companies in mexico and japan see item 2 properties  for additional information on our manufacturing and other sites 

see note 17 segment information  for net sales operating profit and asset information for proprietary products 

contractmanufactured products segment 

our contractmanufactured products reportable segment serves as a fully integrated business focused on the design manufacture and automated assembly of complex devices primarily for pharmaceutical diagnostic and medical device customers these products include a variety of custom contractmanufacturing and assembly solutions which use such technologies as multicomponent molding inmold labeling ultrasonic welding and clean room molding and device assembly we manufacture customerowned components and devices used in surgical diagnostic ophthalmic injectable and other drug delivery systems as well as consumer products 

we have vast expertise in product design and development including inhouse mold design an engineering center for developmental and prototype tooling process design and validation and highspeed automated assemblies 

this reportable segment has manufacturing operations in north america and europe see item 2 properties  for additional information on our manufacturing and other sites 

see note 17 segment information  for net sales operating profit and asset information for contractmanufactured products 

international 

we have significant operations outside of the united states “us” which are managed through the same business segments as our us operations – proprietary products and contractmanufactured products sales outside of the us accounted for 541  of consolidated net sales in 2017  for a geographic breakdown of sales see note 17 segment information  see item 2 properties  for additional information on our manufacturing and other sites 

although the general business processes are similar to the domestic business international operations are exposed to additional risks these risks include currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar “usd” multiple tax jurisdictions and particularly in south america and israel political and social issues that could destabilize local markets and affect the demand for our products 

see further discussion of our international operations the risks associated with our international operations and our attempt to minimize some of these risks in part i item 1a risk factors  part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resources part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  note 1   under the captions financial instruments  and foreign currency translation and note 9 derivative financial instruments  

raw materials 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers aluminum and plastic elastomers include both natural and synthetic materials we currently have access to adequate supplies of these raw materials to meet our production needs through agreements with suppliers 

we employ a supply chain management strategy in our business segments which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply due to regulatory control over our production processes and the cost and time involved in qualifying suppliers we rely on singlesource suppliers for many critical raw materials we purchase certain raw materials in the open market this strategy increases the risk that our supply chain may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production or distribution problem these risks are managed where possible by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites rigorous quality control systems surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in case of an interruption in production or distribution 

intellectual property 

intellectual property including patents trade secrets and knowhow is important to our business we own or license intellectual property rights including issued patents and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries that relate to various aspects of our products some key valueadded and proprietary products and processes are licensed from daikyo our intellectual property rights have been useful in establishing our market position and in the growth of our business and are expected to continue to be of value in the future 

seasonality 

although our proprietary products business is not inherently seasonal sales and operating profit in the second half of the year are typically lower than the first half primarily due to scheduled plant shutdowns in conjunction with our customers production schedules and the yearend impact of holidays on production this can vary from yeartoyear depending upon customer inventory management programs and customer product launches and other factors 

our contractmanufactured products business is not inherently seasonal 

working capital 

we are required to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet customer requirements in addition some of our supply agreements require us to purchase inventory in bulk orders which increases inventory levels but decreases the risk of supply interruption levels of inventory are also influenced by the seasonal patterns addressed above for a more detailed discussion of working capital please refer to the discussion in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resource s 

marketing 

our proprietary products customers include most of the major biologic generic and pharmaceutical drug companies in the world which incorporate our components and other offerings into their products for distribution to the point of care and ultimate enduser  the patient 

our contractmanufactured products customers include many of the worlds largest pharmaceutical diagnostic and medical device companies contractmanufactured products components generally are incorporated into our customers manufacturing lines for further processing or assembly 

our products and services are distributed primarily through our own sales force and distribution network with limited use of contract sales agents and regional distributors 

our ten largest customers accounted for 375  of our consolidated net sales in 2017  but none of these customers individually accounted for more than 10 of net sales see note 17 segment information  for information on sales by significant product group 

order backlog 

order backlog includes firm orders placed by customers for manufacture over a period of time according to their schedule or upon confirmation by the customer we also have contractual arrangements with a number of our customers products covered by these contracts are included in our backlog only as orders are received order 

backlog may be positively or negatively impacted by several factors including customer ordering patterns and the necessary leadtime to deliver customer orders order backlog is one of many measures we use to understand future demand and should not be considered in isolation to predict future sales growth 

at december 31 2017  and 2016  the order backlog for proprietary products was 3774 million and 3733 million respectively the increase in backlog reflects the impact of foreign currency partially offset by the impact of shorter leadtime requirements for customer orders the majority of the order backlog for proprietary products at december 31 2017  is expected to be filled during 2018 

the majority of contractmanufactured products manufacturing activity is governed by contractual volume expectations with terms between one and three years subject to periodic revisions based on customer requirements 

competition 

we compete with several companies across our proprietary products product lines due to the special nature of our pharmaceutical packaging components and our longstanding participation in the market competition for these components is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive costcontrol programs across their operations 

in addition there are a number of competitors supplying medical devices and medical device components we compete in this market on the basis of our reputation for quality and reliability in engineering and project management as well as our knowledge of and experience in compliance with regulatory requirements 

we have specialized knowledge of container closure components which is integral to developing delivery systems with our range of proprietary technologies we compete with new and established companies in the area of drug delivery devices including suppliers of prefillable syringes autoinjectors safety needles and other proprietary systems 

we aim to differentiate ourselves from our competition by being an integrated drug containment and delivery systems global supplier that can provide preapproval primary packaging support and engineering development analytical services regulatory expertise and aftersale technical support customers also appreciate the global scope of our manufacturing capability and our ability to produce many products at multiple sites 

our contractmanufactured products business operates in very competitive markets for its products the competition varies from smaller regional companies to large global molders given the cost pressures they face many of our customers look offshore to reduce cost we aim to differentiate ourselves by leveraging our global capabilities and by employing new technologies such as highspeed automated assembly insertmolding multishot molding and expertise with multiplepiece closure systems 

research and development activities 

we maintain our own researchscale production facilities and laboratories for developing new products and offer contract engineering design and development services to assist customers with new product development our quality control regulatory and laboratory testing capabilities are used to ensure compliance with applicable manufacturing and regulatory standards for primary and secondary pharmaceutical packaging components and delivery systems we continue to seek new innovative opportunities for acquisition licensing partnering or development of products services and technologies that serve the injectable drug containment and delivery market research and development spending will continue to increase as we pursue innovative strategic platforms in prefillable syringes injectable containers advanced injection and safety and administration systems 

commercial development of our new products and services for medical and pharmaceutical applications commonly requires several years new products that we develop may require separate approval as medical devices and products that are intended to be used in the packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical products are subject to both 

customer acceptance of our products and regulatory approval of the customers products following our development period 

we spent 391 million  in 2017  368 million  in 2016  and 341 million  in 2015  on research and development all of which related to proprietary products 

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2017  and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes in 2018 

employees 

as of december 31 2017  we employed approximately 7500  people in our operations throughout the world including approximately 7300  fulltime employees

 item 1a risk factors 

the statements in this section describe major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this form 10k contains some forwardlooking statements that are based on managements beliefs and assumptions current expectations estimates and forecasts we also provide forward 

looking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forwardlooking statements such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts we have attempted wherever possible to identify forwardlooking statements by using words such as “estimate” “expect” “intend” “believe” “plan” “anticipate” and other words and terms of similar meaning in particular these include statements relating to future actions business plans and prospects new products future performance or results of current or anticipated products sales efforts expenses interest rates foreignexchange rates economic effects the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results 

many of the factors that will determine our future results are beyond our ability to control or predict achievement of future results is subject to known or unknown risks or uncertainties including without limitation the risks set forth below therefore actual results could differ materially from past results and those expressed or implied in any forwardlooking statement you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements 

unless required by applicable securities law we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise we also refer you to further disclosures we make on related subjects in our quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k to the sec 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 

the current uncertainty in the global economy including the effects of recession or slow economic growth in the us europe and emerging markets in asia and south america may negatively affect our operating results examples of the effects of these global economic challenges include our suppliers and our customers inability to access the credit markets at commercially reasonable rates reduction in sales due to customers decreasing their inventories in the nearterm or longterm or due to liquidity difficulties reduction in sales due to shortages of materials we purchase from our suppliers reduction in research and development efforts and expenditures by our customers our inability to hedge our currency and raw material risks sufficiently or at commercially reasonable prices insolvency of suppliers or customers inflationary pressures on our supplies or our products and increased expenses due to growing global taxation of corporate profits or revenues including the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 tax act” our operating results in one or more geographic regions may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region if economic and market conditions in the us or europe or in emerging markets weaken further we may experience material adverse impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our sales and profitability are largely dependent on the sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products if the products developed by our customers in the future use another delivery system our sales and profitability could suffer 

our business depends to a substantial extent on customers continued sales and development of products that are delivered by injection if our customers fail to continue to sell develop and deploy injectable products or we are unable to develop new products that assist in the delivery of drugs by alternative methods our sales and profitability may suffer 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

our business is subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations sales outside of the us accounted for 541  of our consolidated net sales in 2017  and we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales in the future in addition many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the us further we intend to continue our expansion into emerging andor fastergrowing markets outside of the us in the future virtually all of our international sales assets and related operating costs and expenses are earned valued or incurred in the currency of the local country primarily the euro the singapore dollar “sgd” and the danish krone in addition we are exposed to japanese yen “yen” as we maintain a 25 ownership interest in and we purchase finished goods and other materials from daikyo we are 

also exposed to currencies in emerging market countries such as the chinese yuan the indian rupee and various south american currencies our consolidated financial statements are presented in usd and therefore we must translate the reported values of our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses into usd which can result in significant fluctuations in the amount of those assets liabilities revenues or expenses the exchange rates between these foreign currencies and usd in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future increases or decreases in the value of usd compared to these foreign currencies may negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

in addition to translation risks we incur currency transaction risk when we or one of our subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction in a currency other than that entitys local currency in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in certain exchange rates we have entered and expect to continue to enter into hedging arrangements including the use of financial derivatives there can be no certainty that we will be able to enter into or maintain hedges of these currency risks or that our hedges will be effective which could have a significant effect on our financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to provide comparative value advantages timely fulfill customer orders or resist pricing pressure we will have to reduce our prices which may reduce our profit margins 

we compete with several companies across our major product lines because of the special nature of these products competition is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive costcontrol programs across their operations companies often compete on the basis of price we aim to differentiate ourselves from our competition by being a “fullservice valueadded” global supplier that is able to provide presale compatibility studies engineering support and other services and sophisticated postsale technical support on a global basis however we face continued pricing pressure from our customers and competitors if we are unable to resist or to offset the effects of continued pricing pressure through our valueadded services improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures or if we have to reduce our prices our sales and profitability may suffer 

consolidation in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries have experienced a significant amount of consolidation as a result of this consolidation competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased in addition group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has placed pricing pressure on suppliers further consolidation within the industries we serve could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products 

we are subject to regulation by governments around the world and if these regulations are not complied with existing and future operations may be curtailed and we could be subject to liability 

the design development manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our products and our customers products that incorporate our products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the us europe and other countries including the us food and drug administration “fda” and the european medicines agency complying with governmental regulation can be costly and can result in required modification or withdrawal of existing products and a substantial delay in the introduction of new products failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or failure to obtain regulatory approval for a new product could result in expenses and actions that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

products incorporating our technologies are subject to regulations and extensive approval or clearance processes which make the timing and success of newproduct commercialization difficult to predict 

the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is expensive and timeconsuming historically most medical devices incorporating our technologies have been subject to the fdas 510k marketing 

approval process which typically lasts from six to nine months supplemental or full premarket approval reviews require a significantly longer period delaying commercialization pharmaceutical products incorporating our technologies are subject to the fdas new drug application process which typically takes a number of years to complete additionally biotechnology products incorporating our technologies are subject to the fdas biologics license application process which also typically takes a number of years to complete outside of the us sales of medical devices and pharmaceutical or biotechnology products are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary from country to country the time required to obtain approval for sale internationally may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 

changes in the regulation of drug products and devices may increase competitive pressure and adversely affect our business 

an effect of the governmental regulation of our customers drug products devices and manufacturing processes is that compliance with regulations makes it difficult to change components and devices produced by one supplier with those from another supplier due to the large amount of data and information that customers must generate to demonstrate that the components and devices are equivalent and pose no additional risk to the patient the regulation of our customers products that incorporate our components and devices has increased over time if the applicable regulations were to be modified in a way that reduced the level of data and information needed to prove equivalency for a change from one suppliers components or devices to those made by another it is likely that the competitive pressure would increase and adversely affect our sales and profitability 

if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights our ability to compete may be affected 

our patents trademarks and other intellectual property are important to our business we rely on patent trademark copyright trade secret and other intellectual property laws as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary information technologies and processes we also have obligations with respect to the nonuse and nondisclosure of third party intellectual property we may need to engage in litigation or similar activities to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others any such litigation could require us to expend significant resources and divert the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel from our business operations there can be no assurance that the steps we will take to prevent misappropriation infringement or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of others will be successful in addition effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for some of our intellectual property in some countries failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business and results of operations in addition if relevant and effective patent protection is not available or has expired we may not be able to prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar or duplicative to ours 

disruption in our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make and sell products and have a negative impact on our reputation performance or financial condition 

we have manufacturing sites throughout the world in some instances however the manufacturing of certain product lines is concentrated in one or only a few of our plants the functioning of our manufacturing and distribution assets and systems could be disrupted for reasons either within or beyond our control including without limitation extreme weather or longerterm climatic changes natural disasters pandemic war accidental damage disruption to the supply of material or services product quality and safety issues systems failure workforce actions or environmental contamination there is a risk that incident management systems in place may prove inadequate and that any disruption may materially adversely affect our ability to make and sell products and therefore materially adversely affect our reputation performance or financial condition 

the medical technology industry is very competitive and customer demands andor new products in the marketplace could cause a reduction in demand 

the medical technology industry is subject to rapid technological changes and we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold we face this competition from a wide 

range of companies including large medical device companies some of which have greater financial and marketing resources than we do we also face competition from firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets in some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for diseases that may be delivered via their own or without a medical device the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology may reduce customer demand for our products or render some of our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive in addition any failure or inability to meet increased customer quality expectations could cause a reduction in demand 

significant developments in us policies could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

changes in us social political regulatory and economic conditions including the impact of the 2017 tax act or in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development immigration and investment could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that vary by country and which could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

we conduct business in most of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world our international operations and our ability to implement our overall business strategy including our plan to continue expanding into emerging andor fastergrowing markets outside of the us are subject to risks and uncertainties that can vary by country and include transportation delays and interruptions political and economic instability and disruptions including the united kingdoms referendum on withdrawal from the european union imposition of duties and tariffs import and export controls the risks of divergent business expectations or cultural incompatibility inherent in establishing and maintaining operations in foreign countries difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations labor strikes andor disputes and potentially adverse tax consequences limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies with third parties or our joint venture partners outside of the us could also create exposure in addition we may not be able to operate in compliance with foreign laws and regulations or comply with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject in the event that these laws or regulations change any of these events could have an adverse effect on our international operations in the future by reducing the demand for our products or decreasing the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

disruptions in the supply of key raw materials could adversely impact our operations 

we generally purchase our raw materials and supplies required for the production of our products in the open market for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability or cost effectiveness many components and raw materials are available andor purchased only from a single supplier due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for these components or materials or do so without excessive cost as a result a reduction or interruption in supply or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

raw material and energy prices have a significant impact on our profitability if raw material andor energy prices increase and we cannot pass those price increases on to our customers our profitability and financial condition may suffer 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers which include synthetic and natural material aluminum and plastic in addition our manufacturing facilities consume a wide variety of energy products to fuel heat and cool our operations supply and demand factors which are beyond our control generally affect the price of our raw materials and utility costs if we are unable to pass along increased raw material prices and energy costs to our customers our profitability and thus our financial condition may be adversely affected the 

prices of many of these raw materials and utilities are cyclical and volatile for example the prices of certain commodities particularly petroleumbased raw materials have in the recent past exhibited rapid changes affecting the cost of synthetic elastomers and plastic while we generally attempt to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of sales price increases historically there has been a time delay between raw material andor energy price increases and our ability to increase the prices of our products in some circumstances we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pressure and other factors 

if we are not timely or successful in newproduct innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems our future revenues and operating income could be adversely affected 

our growth partly depends on newproduct innovation and the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications product development and commercialization is inherently uncertain and is subject to a number of factors outside of our control including any necessary regulatory approvals and commercial acceptance for the products the ultimate timing and successful commercialization of new products and systems requires substantial evaluations of the functional operational clinical and economic viability of our products in addition the timely and adequate availability of filling capacity is essential to both conducting definitive stability trials and the timing of commercialization of customers products in cz vials syringes and cartridges delays interruptions or failures in developing and commercializing newproduct innovations or proprietary multicomponent systems could adversely affect future revenues and operating income in addition adverse conditions may also result in future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we may not succeed in finding and completing acquisition or other strategic transactions if any which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we have historically engaged in acquisition activity and we may in the future engage in acquisitions or other strategic transactions such as joint ventures or investments in other entities we may be unable to identify suitable targets opportunistic or otherwise for acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future if we identify a suitable candidate our ability to successfully implement the strategic transaction would depend on a variety of factors including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and to comply with the restrictions contained in our debt agreements strategic transactions involve risks including those associated with integrating the operations or maintaining the operations as separate as applicable financial reporting disparate technologies and personnel of acquired companies joint ventures or related companies managing geographically dispersed operations or other strategic investments the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience unknown risks and the potential loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies joint ventures or companies in which we may make strategic investments we may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire or strategically develop in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits relating to any such strategic transactions strategic transactions may be expensive time consuming and may strain our resources strategic transactions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of among other things the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and amortization expenses of other intangible assets in addition strategic transactions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities 

product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 

the design manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical packaging and medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects unanticipated use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market a recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals 

our operations must comply with environmental statutes and regulations and any failure to comply could result in extensive costs which would harm our business 

the manufacture of some of our products involves the use transportation storage and disposal of hazardous or toxic materials and is subject to various environmental protection and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate this has exposed us in the past and could expose us in the future to risks of accidental contamination and events of noncompliance with environmental laws any such occurrences could result in regulatory enforcement or personal injury and property damage claims or could lead to a shutdown of some of our operations which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations we currently incur costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations and these costs may become more significant 

a loss of key personnel or highly skilled employees could disrupt our operations 

our executive officers are critical to the management and direction of our businesses our future success depends in large part on our ability to retain these officers and other key employees including people in technical marketing sales and research positions competition for experienced employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees our business could be adversely affected although we believe that we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise our inability to do so on a timely basis could disrupt the operations of the unit affected or our overall operations in addition because of the complex nature of many of our products and programs we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled engineering staff and workforce our operations could be disrupted by a shortage of available skilled employees 

the uncertain effects of potential climate change legislation could lead to significantly increased costs 

if legislation or regulations are enacted or promulgated in the us europe or asia or any other jurisdictions in which we do business that limit or reduce allowable greenhouse gas emissions and other emissions such restrictions could have a significant effect on our operating and financial decisions including those involving capital expenditures to reduce emissions and our results of operations our manufacturing operations may not be able to operate as planned if we are not able to comply with new legal and regulatory legislation around climate change or it may become too costly to operate in a profitable manner additionally suppliers added expenses could be passed on to us in the form of higher prices and we may not be able to pass on such expenses to our customers through price increases 

healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations 

changes in the us or international healthcare systems including the patient protection and affordable care act the “ppaca” could result in reduced demand for our products as our sales depend in part on the extent to which pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities private insurers and other thirdparty payers for the costs of our products the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers which can vary among public and private sources may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these products in a particular jurisdiction legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the us including the possible termination of the ppaca and potential replacement thereafter with a different system or abroad for example those under consideration in france germany italy and the united kingdom could significantly reduce reimbursement for our customers products which could in turn reduce the demand for our products 

moreover in the coming years additional changes could be made to global governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our products we will continue to evaluate the ppaca as amended the implementation of regulations or guidance related to various provisions of the ppaca by federal agencies the potential repeal and replacement of the ppaca as well as trends and changes that may be encouraged by the legislation and other healthcare legislation globally and that may potentially impact our business over time 

no assurance can be given that we will continue to pay or declare dividends 

we have historically paid dividends however there can be no assurance that we will pay or declare dividends in the future the actual declaration and payment of future dividends the amount of any such dividends and the establishment of record and payment dates if any are subject to determination by our board of directors each quarter after its review of our thencurrent strategy applicable debt covenants and financial performance and position among other things our declaration and payment of future dividends is subject to risks and uncertainties including deterioration of our financial performance or position inability to declare a dividend in compliance with applicable laws or debt covenants an increase in our cash needs or decrease in available cash and the business judgment of the board of directors that a declaration of a dividend is not in our best interest 

our results of operations and earnings may not meet guidance or expectations  

we provide public guidance on our expected results of operations for future periods this guidance is comprised of forwardlooking statements subject to risks and uncertainties including the risks and uncertainties described in this form 10k and in our other public filings and public statements and is based necessarily on assumptions we make at the time we provide such guidance our guidance may not always be accurate if in the future our results of operations for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or if we reduce our guidance for future periods the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 

we are exposed to credit risk on accounts receivable and certain prepayments made in the normal course of business this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

a substantial majority of our outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance in addition we have made prepayments associated with insurance premiums and other advances in the normal course of business while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on trade receivables and other current assets there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk and avoid losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

unauthorized access to our or our customers information and systems could negatively impact our business 

we may face certain security threats including threats to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data and systems we maintain an extensive network of technical security controls policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems in order to address these threats while these measures are designed to prevent detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems certain types of attacks could result in financial or information losses andor reputational harm if we cannot prevent the unauthorized access release andor corruption of our or our customers confidential classified or personally identifiable information our reputation could be damaged andor we could face financial losses 

if we fail to comply with our obligations under our distributorship or license agreements with daikyo the agreements are terminated early or we are unable to renew these agreements on the same or substantially similar terms we could lose license rights that are important to our business 

key valueadded and proprietary products and processes are licensed from our affiliate daikyo including but not limited to cz flurotec ®  and b2coating technologies our rights to these products and processes are licensed pursuant to agreements that expire in 2027 however if the agreements are terminated early our business could be adversely impacted

we paid cash dividends totaling 391 million 053 per share 358 million 049 per share and 324 million 045 per share during 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

the table below presents selected liquidity and capital measures as of 



cash and cash equivalents include all instruments that have maturities of ninety days or less when purchased working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents and total invested capital is defined as the sum of net debt and total equity net debt and total invested capital are nonus gaap financial measures that should not be used as a substitute for the comparable us gaap financial measures the nonus gaap financial measures are incorporated into our discussion and analysis as management believes that this information provides users with a valuable insight into our overall performance and financial position 

cash and cash equivalents –  our cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2017  consisted of cash held in depository accounts with banks around the world and cash invested in highquality shortterm investments the cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2017  included 1005 million of cash held by subsidiaries within the us and 1354 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the us during 2017 we repatriated 630 

million of cash held by nonus subsidiaries we do not expect any additional tax costs associated with the repatriation in response to the 2017 tax act we reevaluated our position regarding permanent reinvestment of foreign subsidiary earnings and profits through 2017 with the exception of china and mexico both of which will remain permanently reinvested and elected to include in our provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2017 an estimated liability of 98 million related to foreign withholding taxes and state income taxes that will be incurred upon the distribution of those foreign subsidiary earnings and profits to the us at a future date please refer to note 15 income taxes  for discussion of the undistributed earnings of our china and mexico entities at december 31 2017 

working capital   working capital at december 31 2017  increased by 631 million or 157 as compared to december 31 2016 including an increase of 247 million due to foreign currency translation excluding the impact of currency exchange rates cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable inventories and total current liabilities increased by 207 million 397 million 36 million and 238 million respectively the increase in accounts receivable was due to increased sales activity and longer payment terms in 2017 the increase in current liabilities was due to an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities partially offset by the payment of our 331 million fiveyear term loan due january 2018 

debt and credit facilities   the 316 million decrease in total debt at december 31 2017  as compared to december 31 2016  resulted from net debt repayments of 349 million which included the payment of our 331 million fiveyear term loan due january 2018 partially offset by foreign currency rate fluctuations of 31 million and a reduction of 02 million in unamortized debt issuance costs 

our sources of liquidity include our credit facility at december 31 2017 we had 296 million in outstanding longterm borrowings under this facility of which 44 million was denominated in yen and 252 million was denominated in euro these borrowings together with outstanding letters of credit of 29 million resulted in a borrowing capacity available under our credit facility of 2675 million at december 31 2017 we do not expect any significant limitations on our ability to access this source of funds please refer to note 8 debt  for further discussion of our credit facility 

pursuant to the financial covenants in our debt agreements we are required to maintain established interest coverage ratios and to not exceed established leverage ratios in addition the agreements contain other customary covenants none of which we consider restrictive to our operations at december 31 2017 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements throughout 2018 

we believe that cash on hand and cash generated from operations together with availability under our credit facility will be adequate to address our foreseeable liquidity needs based on our current expectations of our business operations capital expenditures and scheduled payments of debt obligations 

commitments and contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our commitments and contractual obligations at december 31 2017  these obligations are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity 



 

 

 

 

reserves for uncertain tax positions   the table above does not include 32 million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2017  due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for amounts which may be paid 

letters of credit   we have letters of credit totaling 29 million  supporting the reimbursement of workers compensation and other claims paid on our behalf by insurance carriers our accrual for insurance obligations was 38 million  at december 31 2017  of which 09 million  is in excess of our deductible and therefore is reimbursable by the insurance company 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2017  we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases unconditional purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business and outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

managements discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with us gaap the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions some of which are subjective and complex that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our results of operations and financial position 

revenue recognition  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists title and risk of loss have transferred the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured generally sales are recognized upon shipment or upon delivery to our customers site based upon shipping terms or legal requirements some customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes we record rebate costs when sales occur based on our assessment of the likelihood that the required volumes will be attained we also maintain an allowance for product returns as we believe that we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of returns based on our substantial historical experience 

impairment of longlived assets longlived assets including property plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable an asset is considered impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future expected undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset once an asset is considered impaired an impairment loss is recorded within other 

income expense for the difference between the assets carrying value and its fair value for assets held and used in the business management determines fair value using estimated future cash flows to be derived from the asset discounted to a net present value using an appropriate discount rate for assets held for sale or for investment purposes management determines fair value by estimating the proceeds to be received upon sale of the asset less disposition costs during 2016 as part of our restructuring plan we recorded within other expense a 45 million noncash asset writedown associated with the discontinued use of certain equipment 

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually following the completion of our annual budget and longrange planning process or whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is the same as or one level below our operating segments in january 2017 the fasb issued guidance which removes the second step of the goodwill impairment test a goodwill impairment charge will now be the amount by which a reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2019 early adoption is permitted we adopted this guidance as of january 1 2017 on a prospective basis considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test such as future sales future cash flows and longterm growth rates are consistent with internal projections and operating plans amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test are also largely dependent on the continued sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products as well as our timeliness and success in newproduct innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems changes in the estimate of fair value including the estimate of future cash flows could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position recent accounting guidance also allows entities to first assess qualitative factors including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors and overall financial performance to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test as each of our reporting units had a fair value in excess of its carrying value of at least 180 within our 2016 annual impairment test we elected to follow this guidance for our 2017 annual impairment test based upon our assessment we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units was less than its carrying amount and determined that it was not necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test in 2017 

at december 31 2015 a trademark had been determined to have an indefinite life and therefore was not subject to amortization during 2016 as part of our restructuring plan we recorded within other expense a 100 million noncash asset writedown associated with the discontinued use of this trademark 

intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable during 2016 as part of our restructuring plan we recorded within other expense a 28 million noncash asset writedown associated with the discontinued use of a patent 

employee benefits  we maintain funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans in the us and a number of other countries that cover employees who meet eligibility requirements in addition we sponsor postretirement benefit plans which provide healthcare benefits for eligible employees who retire or become disabled the measurement of annual cost and obligations under these defined benefit postretirement plans is subject to a number of assumptions which are specific for each of our us and foreign plans the assumptions which are reviewed at least annually are relevant to both the plan assets where applicable and the obligation for benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees two of the most critical assumptions in determining pension and retiree medical plan expense are the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement age rates of compensation increases mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience for our funded plans we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our plan assets as well as historical and expected rates of return in estimating the longterm rate of return on plan assets under us gaap differences between actual and expected results are generally accumulated in other comprehensive income loss as actuarial gains or losses and subsequently amortized into earnings over future periods 

changes in key assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position we estimate that every 25basis point reduction in our longterm rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by 04 million and every 25basis point reduction in our discount rate would increase pension expense by 05 million a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations our net pension underfunded balance at december 31 2017  was 485 million compared to 698 million at december 31 2016  our underfunded balance for other postretirement benefits was 71 million at december 31 2017  compared to 80 million at december 31 2016  

income taxes  we estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation in addition deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established to recognize differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities we maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized the recoverability of tax assets is subject to our estimates of future profitability generally at the respective subsidiary company and country level changes in tax legislation business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined 

  

when accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements we apply a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 

contingent consideration 

the fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to the smartdose ®  technology platform the “smartdose contingent consideration” was initially determined using a probabilityweighted income approach and is revalued at each reporting date or more frequently if circumstances dictate changes in the fair value of this obligation are recorded as income or expense within other income expense in our consolidated statements of income the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration are the sales projections the probability of success factors and the discount rate significant increases or decreases in any of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement as development and commercialization of the smartdose technology platform progresses we may need to update the sales projections the probability of success factors and the discount rate used this could result in a material increase or decrease to the smartdose contingent consideration 

see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 2 new accounting standards  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our significant accounting policies recently adopted accounting standards and accounting standards issued but not yet adopted 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risk factors such as fluctuating interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and increasing commodity prices these risk factors can impact our results of operations cash flows and financial position to manage these risks we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps call options and forward exchange contracts for periods consistent with and for notional amounts equal to or less than the underlying exposures in accordance with company policy derivative financial instruments are not used for investment or trading purposes 

foreign currency exchange risk 

sales outside of the us accounted for 541  of consolidated net sales in 2017  virtually all of these sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into usd for consolidated reporting purposes although the majority of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary they may also hold assets or liabilities denominated in other currencies these items may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains and losses as a result our results of operations and 

financial position are exposed to changing currency exchange rates we periodically use forward contracts to hedge certain transactions or to manage monthend balance sheet exposures on crosscurrency intercompany loans 

we have designated our €210 million eurodenominated borrowings under our credit facility as a hedge of our net investment in certain european subsidiaries we also have ¥5000 million in yendenominated borrowings under our credit facility which has been designated as a hedge of our net investment in daikyo at december 31 2017  a cumulative foreign currency translation loss on these hedges of 14 million net of tax of 02 million was recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss 

interest rate risk    

as a result of our normal borrowing activities we have longterm debt with both fixed and variable interest rates longterm debt consists of senior notes and revolving credit facilities our exposures to fluctuations in interest rates are managed to the extent considered necessary by entering into interest rate swap agreements 

the following table summarizes our interest rate risksensitive instruments 



commodity price risk 

many of our proprietary products are made from synthetic elastomers which are derived from the petroleum refining process we purchase the majority of our elastomers via longterm supply contracts some of which contain clauses that provide for surcharges related to fluctuations in crude oil prices in recent years raw material costs have fluctuated due to crude oil price fluctuations we expect this volatility to continue we will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects on gross profit 

in november 2016 we purchased a series of call options for a total of 96525  barrels of crude oil to mitigate our exposure to such oilbased surcharges and protect operating cash flows with regards to a portion of our forecasted elastomer purchases through november 2017 with these contracts in 2016 the gain recorded in cost of goods and services sold related to these options was less than 01 million  during 2017 the loss recorded in cost of goods and services sold related to these options was 02 million  

in november 2017 we purchased a series of call options for a total of 125166  barrels of crude oil through may 2019 during 2017 the loss recorded in cost of goods and services sold related to these options was less than 01 million  

as of december 31 2017 we had outstanding contracts to purchase 115701  barrels of crude oil at a strike price of 70  per barrel

we employ a supply chain management strategy in our business segments which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply due to regulatory control over our production processes and the cost and time involved in qualifying suppliers we rely on singlesource suppliers for many critical raw materials we purchase certain raw materials in the open market this strategy increases the risk that our supply chain may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production problem these risks are managed where possible by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites rigorous quality control systems surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in case of an interruption in production 

intellectual property 

intellectual property including patents trade secrets and knowhow is important to our business we own or license intellectual property rights including issued patents and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries that relate to various aspects of our products some key valueadded and proprietary products and processes are licensed from daikyo our intellectual property rights have been useful in establishing our market position and in the growth of our business and are expected to continue to be of value in the future 

seasonality 

although our proprietary products business is not inherently seasonal sales and operating profit in the second half of the year are typically lower than the first half primarily due to scheduled plant shutdowns in conjunction with our customers production schedules and the yearend impact of holidays on production this can vary from yeartoyear depending upon customer inventory management programs and customer product launches 

our contractmanufactured products business is not inherently seasonal 

working capital 

we are required to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet customer requirements in addition some of our supply agreements require us to purchase inventory in bulk orders which increases inventory levels but decreases the risk of supply interruption levels of inventory are also influenced by the seasonal patterns addressed above for a more detailed discussion of working capital please refer to the discussion in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resource s 

marketing 

our proprietary products customers include most of the major biologic generic and pharmaceutical drug companies in the world which incorporate our components and other offerings into their products for distribution to the ultimate enduser 

our contractmanufactured products customers include many of the worlds largest pharmaceutical diagnostic and medical device companies contractmanufactured products components generally are incorporated into our customers manufacturing lines for further processing or assembly 

our products and services are distributed primarily through our own sales force and distribution network with limited use of contract sales agents and regional distributors 

our ten largest customers accounted for 368  of our consolidated net sales in 2016  but none of these customers individually accounted for more than 10 of net sales see note 17 segment information  for information on sales by significant product group 

order backlog 

order backlog includes firm orders placed by customers for manufacture over a period of time according to their schedule or upon confirmation by the customer we also have contractual arrangements with a number of our customers products covered by these contracts are included in our backlog only as orders are received order backlog may be positively or negatively impacted by several factors including customer ordering patterns and the necessary leadtime to deliver customer orders order backlog is one of many measures we use to understand future demand and should not be considered in isolation to predict future sales growth 

at december 31 2016 and 2015 the order backlog for proprietary products was 3733 million and 4132 million respectively the decrease in backlog primarily reflects a return to normal levels and an unfavorable foreign currency impact in 2015 we had orders being placed further in advance by certain customers some as much as 

several quarters while others focused more on shortterm stockbuilding the majority of the order backlog for proprietary products at december 31 2016 is expected to be filled during 2017 

the majority of contractmanufactured products manufacturing activity is governed by contractual volume expectations with terms between one and three years subject to periodic revisions based on customer requirements 

competition 

we compete with several companies across our proprietary products product lines due to the special nature of our pharmaceutical packaging components and our longstanding participation in the market competition for these components is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive costcontrol programs across their operations 

in addition there is a small number of competitors supplying medical devices and medical device components we compete in this market on the basis of our reputation for quality and reliability in engineering and project management as well as our knowledge of and experience in compliance with regulatory requirements 

we also have specialized knowledge of container closure components which is integral to developing delivery systems with our range of proprietary technologies we compete with new and established companies in the area of drug delivery devices including suppliers of prefillable syringes autoinjectors safety needles and other proprietary systems 

we differentiate ourselves from our competition by being an integrated drug containment and delivery systems global supplier that can provide preapproval primary packaging support and engineering development analytical services regulatory expertise and aftersale technical support customers also appreciate the global scope of our manufacturing capability and our ability to produce many products at multiple sites 

our contractmanufactured products business operates in very competitive markets for its products the competition varies from smaller regional companies to large global molders given the cost pressures they face many of our customers look offshore to reduce cost we differentiate ourselves by leveraging our global capability and by employing new technologies such as highspeed automated assembly insertmolding multishot molding and expertise with multiplepiece closure systems 

research and development activities 

we maintain our own researchscale production facilities and laboratories for developing new products and offer contract engineering design and development services to assist customers with new product development our quality control regulatory and laboratory testing capabilities are used to ensure compliance with applicable manufacturing and regulatory standards for primary and secondary pharmaceutical packaging components and delivery systems the engineering departments are responsible for product and tooling design and testing and for the design and construction of processing equipment we continue to seek new innovative opportunities for acquisition licensing partnering or development of products services and technologies that serve the injectable drug containment and delivery market research and development spending will continue to increase as we pursue innovative strategic platforms in prefillable syringes injectable containers advanced injection and safety and administration systems 

commercial development of our new products and services for medical and pharmaceutical applications commonly requires several years new products that we develop may require separate approval as medical devices and products that are intended to be used in the packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical products are subject to both customer acceptance of our products and regulatory approval of the customers products following our development period 

we spent 368 million  in 2016  341 million  in 2015  and 373 million  in 2014  on research and development all of which related to proprietary products 

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2016  and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes in 2017 

employees 

as of december 31 2016  we employed approximately 7300  people in our operations throughout the world including approximately 7100 fulltime employees 




 item 1a risk factors 

the statements in this section describe major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this form 10k contains some forwardlooking statements that are based on managements beliefs and assumptions current expectations estimates and forecasts we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forwardlooking statements such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts we have attempted wherever possible to identify forwardlooking statements by using words such as “estimate” “expect” “intend” “believe” “plan” “anticipate” and other words and terms of similar meaning in particular these include statements relating to future actions business plans and prospects new products future performance or results of current or anticipated products sales efforts expenses interest rates foreignexchange rates economic effects the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results 

many of the factors that will determine our future results are beyond our ability to control or predict achievement of future results is subject to known or unknown risks or uncertainties and therefore actual results could differ materially from past results and those expressed or implied in any forwardlooking statement you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements 

unless required by applicable securities law we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise we also refer you to further disclosures we make on related subjects in our quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k to the sec 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 

the current uncertainty in the global economy including the effects of recession or slow economic growth in the us europe and emerging markets in asia and south america may negatively affect our operating results examples of the effects of these global economic challenges include our suppliers and our customers inability to access the credit markets at commercially reasonable rates reduction in sales due to customers decreasing their inventories in the nearterm or longterm or due to liquidity difficulties reduction in sales due to shortages of materials we purchase from our suppliers reduction in research and development efforts and expenditures by our customers our inability to hedge our currency and raw material risks sufficiently or at commercially reasonable prices insolvency of suppliers or customers inflationary pressures on our supplies or our products and increased expenses due to growing global taxation of corporate profits or revenues our operating results in one or more geographic regions may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region if economic and market conditions in the us or europe or in emerging markets weaken further we may experience material adverse impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our sales and profitability are largely dependent on the sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products if the products developed by our customers in the future use another delivery system our sales and profitability could suffer 

our business depends to a substantial extent on customers continued sales and development of products that are delivered by injection if our customers fail to continue to sell develop and deploy injectable products or we are unable to develop new products that assist in the delivery of drugs by alternative methods our sales and profitability may suffer 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

our business is subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations sales outside of the us accounted for 511  of our consolidated net sales in 2016  and we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales in the future in addition many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the us further we intend to continue our expansion into emerging andor fastergrowing markets outside of the us in the future virtually all of our international sales assets and related operating costs and expenses are earned valued or incurred in the currency of the local country primarily the euro the singapore dollar and the danish krone in addition we are exposed to japanese yen “yen” as we maintain a 25 ownership interest in and we purchase finished goods and other materials from daikyo we are also exposed to currencies in emerging market countries such as the chinese yuan the indian rupee and various south american currencies including the venezuelan bolivar and the argentinian peso our consolidated financial statements are presented in usd and therefore we must translate the reported values of our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses into usd which can result in significant fluctuations in the amount of those assets liabilities revenues or expenses the exchange rates between these foreign currencies and usd in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future increases or decreases in the value of usd compared to these foreign currencies may negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

in addition to translation risks we incur currency transaction risk when we or one of our subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction in a currency other than that entitys local currency in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in certain exchange rates we have entered and expect to continue to enter into hedging arrangements including the use of financial derivatives there can be no certainty that we will be able to enter into or maintain hedges of these currency risks or that our hedges will be effective which could have a significant effect on our financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to provide comparative value advantages timely fulfill customer orders or resist pricing pressure we will have to reduce our prices which may reduce our profit margins 

we compete with several companies across our major product lines because of the special nature of these products competition is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive costcontrol programs across their operations companies often compete on the basis of price we differentiate ourselves from our competition by being a “fullservice valueadded” global supplier that is able to provide presale compatibility studies engineering support and other services and sophisticated postsale technical support on a global basis however we face continued pricing pressure from our customers and competitors if we are unable to resist or to offset the effects of continued pricing pressure through our valueadded services improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures or if we have to reduce our prices our sales and profitability may suffer 

consolidation in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries have experienced a significant amount of consolidation as a result of this consolidation competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased in addition group 

purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has placed pricing pressure on suppliers further consolidation within the industries we serve could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products 

we are subject to regulation by governments around the world and if these regulations are not complied with existing and future operations may be curtailed and we could be subject to liability 

the design development manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our products and our customers products that incorporate our products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the us europe and other countries including the fda and the european medicines agency complying with governmental regulation can be costly and can result in required modification or withdrawal of existing products and a substantial delay in the introduction of new products failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or failure to obtain regulatory approval for a new product could result in expenses and actions that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

products incorporating our technologies are subject to regulations and extensive approval or clearance processes which make the timing and success of newproduct commercialization difficult to predict 

the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is expensive and timeconsuming historically most medical devices incorporating our technologies have been subject to the fdas 510k marketing approval process which typically lasts from six to nine months supplemental or full premarket approval reviews require a significantly longer period delaying commercialization pharmaceutical products incorporating our technologies are subject to the fdas new drug application process which typically takes a number of years to complete additionally biotechnology products incorporating our technologies are subject to the fdas biologics license application process which also typically takes a number of years to complete outside of the us sales of medical devices and pharmaceutical or biotechnology products are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary from country to country the time required to obtain approval for sale internationally may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 

changes in the regulation of drug products and devices may increase competitive pressure and adversely affect our business 

an effect of the governmental regulation of our customers drug products devices and manufacturing processes is that compliance with regulations makes it difficult to change components and devices produced by one supplier with those from another supplier due to the large amount of data and information that customers must generate to demonstrate that the components and devices are equivalent and pose no additional risk to the patient the regulation of our customers products that incorporate our components and devices has increased over time if the applicable regulations were to be modified in a way that reduced the level of data and information needed to prove equivalency for a change from one suppliers components or devices to those made by another it is likely that the competitive pressure would increase and adversely affect our sales and profitability 

if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights our ability to compete may be affected 

our patents trademarks and other intellectual property are important to our business we rely on patent trademark copyright trade secret and other intellectual property laws as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary information technologies and processes we also have obligations with respect to the nonuse and nondisclosure of third party intellectual property we may need to engage in litigation or similar activities to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others any such litigation could require us to expend significant resources and divert the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel from our business operations there can be no assurance that the steps we will take to prevent misappropriation infringement or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of others will be successful in addition effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for some of our intellectual property in some countries failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business and results of operations in addition 

if relevant and effective patent protection is not available or has expired we may not be able to prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar or duplicative to ours 

disruption in our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make and sell products and have a negative impact on our reputation performance or financial condition 

we have manufacturing sites throughout the world in some instances however the manufacturing of certain product lines is concentrated in one or only a few of our plants the functioning of our manufacturing and distribution assets and systems could be disrupted for reasons either within or beyond our control including without limitation extreme weather or longerterm climatic changes natural disasters pandemic war accidental damage disruption to the supply of material or services product quality and safety issues systems failure workforce actions or environmental contamination there is a risk that incident management systems in place may prove inadequate and that any disruption may materially adversely affect our ability to make and sell products and therefore materially adversely affect our reputation performance or financial condition 

the medical technology industry is very competitive and customer demands andor new products in the marketplace could cause a reduction in demand 

the medical technology industry is subject to rapid technological changes and we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold we face this competition from a wide range of companies including large medical device companies some of which have greater financial and marketing resources than we do we also face competition from firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets in some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for diseases that may be delivered without a medical device the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology may reduce customer demand for our products or render some of our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive in addition any failure or inability to meet increased customer quality expectations could cause a reduction in demand 

significant developments in us policies could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

changes in us social political regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development immigration and investment could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that vary by country and which could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

we conduct business in most of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world our international operations and our ability to implement our overall business strategy including our plan to continue expanding into emerging andor fastergrowing markets outside of the us are subject to risks and uncertainties that can vary by country and include transportation delays and interruptions political and economic instability and disruptions including the united kingdoms referendum on withdrawal from the european union imposition of duties and tariffs import and export controls the risks of divergent business expectations or cultural incompatibility inherent in establishing and maintaining operations in foreign countries difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations labor strikes andor disputes and potentially adverse tax consequences limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies with third parties or our joint venture partners outside of the us could also create exposure in addition we may not be able to operate in compliance with foreign laws and regulations or comply with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject in the event that these laws or regulations change any of these events could have an adverse effect on our international operations in the future by reducing the demand for our products or decreasing the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

disruptions in the supply of key raw materials could adversely impact our operations 

we generally purchase our raw materials and supplies required for the production of our products in the open market for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability or cost effectiveness many components and raw materials are available andor purchased only from a single supplier due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for these components or materials or do so without excessive cost as a result a reduction or interruption in manufacturing or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

raw material and energy prices have a significant impact on our profitability if raw material andor energy prices increase and we cannot pass those price increases on to our customers our profitability and financial condition may suffer 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers which include synthetic and natural material aluminum and plastic in addition our manufacturing facilities consume a wide variety of energy products to fuel heat and cool our operations supply and demand factors which are beyond our control generally affect the price of our raw materials and utility costs if we are unable to pass along increased raw material prices and energy costs to our customers our profitability and thus our financial condition may be adversely affected the prices of many of these raw materials and utilities are cyclical and volatile for example the prices of certain commodities particularly petroleumbased raw materials have in the recent past exhibited rapid changes affecting the cost of synthetic elastomers and plastic while we generally attempt to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of sales price increases historically there has been a time delay between raw material andor energy price increases and our ability to increase the prices of our products in some circumstances we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pressure and other factors 

if we are not timely or successful in newproduct innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems our future revenues and operating income could be adversely affected 

our growth partly depends on newproduct innovation and the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications product development and commercialization is inherently uncertain and is subject to a number of factors outside of our control including any necessary regulatory approvals and commercial acceptance for the products the ultimate timing and successful commercialization of new products and systems requires substantial evaluations of the functional operational clinical and economic viability of our products in addition the timely and adequate availability of filling capacity is essential to both conducting definitive stability trials and the timing of commercialization of customers products in cz prefilled cartridges and syringes delays interruptions or failures in developing and commercializing newproduct innovations or proprietary multicomponent systems could adversely affect future revenues and operating income in addition adverse conditions may also result in future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we may not succeed in finding and completing acquisition or other strategic transactions if any which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we have historically engaged in acquisition activity and we may in the future engage in acquisitions or other strategic transactions such as joint ventures or investments in other entities we may be unable to identify suitable targets opportunistic or otherwise for acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future if we identify a suitable candidate our ability to successfully implement the strategic transaction would depend on a variety of factors including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and to comply with the restrictions contained in our debt agreements strategic transactions involve risks including those associated with integrating the operations or maintaining the operations as separate as applicable financial reporting disparate technologies and personnel of acquired companies joint ventures or related companies managing geographically dispersed operations or other strategic investments the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the inherent risks in 

entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience unknown risks and the potential loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies joint ventures or companies in which we may make strategic investments we may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire or strategically develop in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits relating to any such strategic transactions strategic transactions may be expensive time consuming and may strain our resources strategic transactions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of among other things the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and amortization expenses of other intangible assets in addition strategic transactions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities 

product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 

the design manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical packaging and medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects unanticipated use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market a recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals 

our operations must comply with environmental statutes and regulations and any failure to comply could result in extensive costs which would harm our business 

the manufacture of some of our products involves the use transportation storage and disposal of hazardous or toxic materials and is subject to various environmental protection and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate this has exposed us in the past and could expose us in the future to risks of accidental contamination and events of noncompliance with environmental laws any such occurrences could result in regulatory enforcement or personal injury and property damage claims or could lead to a shutdown of some of our operations which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations we currently incur costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations and these costs may become more significant 

a loss of key personnel or highly skilled employees could disrupt our operations 

our executive officers are critical to the management and direction of our businesses our future success depends in large part on our ability to retain these officers and other key employees including people in technical marketing sales and research positions competition for experienced employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees our business could be adversely affected although we believe that we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise our inability to do so on a timely basis could disrupt the operations of the unit affected or our overall operations in addition because of the complex nature of many of our products and programs we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled engineering staff and workforce our operations could be disrupted by a shortage of available skilled employees 

the uncertain effects of potential climate change legislation could lead to significantly increased costs 

if legislation or regulations are enacted or promulgated in the us europe or asia or any other jurisdictions in which we do business that limit or reduce allowable greenhouse gas emissions and other emissions such restrictions could have a significant effect on our operating and financial decisions including those involving capital expenditures to reduce emissions and our results of operations our manufacturing operations may not be able to operate as planned if we are not able to comply with new legal and regulatory legislation around climate change or it may become too costly to operate in a profitable manner additionally suppliers added expenses could be passed 

on to us in the form of higher prices and we may not be able to pass on such expenses to our customers through price increases 

healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations 

the patient protection and affordable care act the “ppaca” was enacted in march 2010 and could result in reduced demand for our products as our sales depend in part on the extent to which pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities private insurers and other thirdparty payers for the costs of our products the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers which can vary among public and private sources may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these products in a particular jurisdiction legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the us including the possible termination of the ppaca and potential replacement thereafter with a different system or abroad for example those under consideration in france germany italy and the united kingdom could significantly reduce reimbursement for our customers products which could in turn reduce the demand for our products 

moreover in the coming years additional changes could be made to global governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our products we will continue to evaluate the ppaca as amended the implementation of regulations or guidance related to various provisions of the ppaca by federal agencies the potential repeal and replacement of the ppaca as well as trends and changes that may be encouraged by the legislation and other healthcare legislation globally and that may potentially impact our business over time 

no assurance can be given that we will continue to pay or declare dividends 

we have historically paid dividends however there can be no assurance that we will pay or declare dividends in the future the actual declaration and payment of future dividends the amount of any such dividends and the establishment of record and payment dates if any are subject to determination by our board of directors each quarter after its review of our thencurrent strategy applicable debt covenants and financial performance and position among other things our declaration and payment of future dividends is subject to risks and uncertainties including deterioration of our financial performance or position inability to declare a dividend in compliance with applicable laws or debt covenants an increase in our cash needs or decrease in available cash and the business judgment of the board of directors that a declaration of a dividend is not in our best interest 

our results of operations and earnings may not meet guidance or expectations  

we provide public guidance on our expected results of operations for future periods this guidance is comprised of forwardlooking statements subject to risks and uncertainties including the risks and uncertainties described in this form 10k and in our other public filings and public statements and is based necessarily on assumptions we make at the time we provide such guidance our guidance may not always be accurate if in the future our results of operations for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or if we reduce our guidance for future periods the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 

we are exposed to credit risk on accounts receivable and certain prepayments made in the normal course of business this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

a substantial majority of our outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance in addition we have made prepayments associated with insurance premiums and other advances in the normal course of business while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on trade receivables and other current assets there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk and avoid losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

unauthorized access to our or our customers information and systems could negatively impact our business 

we may face certain security threats including threats to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data and systems we maintain an extensive network of technical security controls policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems in order to address these threats while these measures are designed to prevent detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems certain types of attacks could result in financial or information losses andor reputational harm if we cannot prevent the unauthorized access release andor corruption of our or our customers confidential classified or personally identifiable information our reputation could be damaged andor we could face financial losses 

if we fail to comply with our obligations under our distributorship or license agreements with daikyo or we are unable to renew these agreements on the same or substantially similar terms we could lose license rights that are important to our business 

key valueadded and proprietary products and processes are licensed from our affiliate daikyo including but not limited to cz flurotec and b2coating technologies our rights to these products and processes are licensed pursuant to agreements that expire in 2027 however if the agreements are terminated early our business could be adversely impacted

in 2015 our business operations consisted of two reportable segments packaging systems and delivery systems beginning in 2016 we changed our organization and reporting structure for our next phase of growth and development which resulted in a change to proprietary products and contractmanufactured products as our reportable segments our proprietary products reportable segment which is a combination of the previous packaging systems segment and the proprietary products portion of the previous delivery systems segment develops commercial operational and innovation strategies across our global network with specific emphasis on product offerings to biologic generic and pharmaceutical drug customers our contractmanufactured products reportable segment which consists of the contract manufacturing portion of the previous delivery systems segment serves as a fully integrated business focused on the design manufacture and automated assembly of complex devices primarily for pharmaceutical diagnostic and medical device customers we also maintain global partnerships to share technologies and market products with affiliates in japan and mexico 

as a result of our global manufacturing and distribution presence more than half of our revenues are generated outside of the us in currencies other than usd including approximately 40 in europe and 10 collectively in asia and south america fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates therefore can have a significant effect on our consolidated financial results generally our financial results are affected positively by a weaker usd and negatively by a stronger usd as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business in terms of net sales the most significant foreign currencies are the euro the singapore dollar and the danish krone with eurodenominated sales representing the majority of sales transacted in foreign currencies in addition we are 

exposed to yen as we maintain a 25 ownership interest in and we purchase finished goods and other materials from daikyo we are also exposed to currencies in emerging market countries such as the chinese yuan the indian rupee and various south american currencies including the venezuelan bolivar and the argentinian peso both of which were unfavorable to our results in 2016 during 2016 average exchange rates were unfavorable versus the exchange rates realized in 2015 foreign currency translation resulted in lower reported net sales operating profit net income and net income per diluted share of 175 million 40 million 29 million and 004 respectively as compared to 2015 

segment results presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of this change please refer to note 17 segment information  for additional details

the table below presents selected liquidity and capital measures as of 



cash and cash equivalents include all instruments that have maturities of ninety days or less when purchased working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents and total invested capital is defined as the sum of net debt and total equity net debt and total invested capital are nonus gaap financial measures that should not be used as a substitute for the comparable us gaap financial measures the nonus gaap financial measures are incorporated into our discussion and analysis as 

management believes that this information provides users with a valuable insight into our overall performance and financial position 

cash and cash equivalents –  our cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2016  consisted of cash held in depository accounts with banks around the world and cash invested in highquality shortterm investments the cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2016  included 831 million of cash held by subsidiaries within the us and 1199 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the us deferred income taxes have not been provided for any funds held by the subsidiaries outside of the us as such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the us 

working capital   working capital at december 31 2016  increased by 415 million or 115 as compared to december 31 2015 including a decrease of 58 million due to foreign currency translation excluding the impact of currency exchange rates cash and cash equivalents decreased by 703 million accounts receivable and inventories increased by 233 million and 212 million respectively and total current liabilities decreased by 700 million accounts receivable and inventories increased due to increased sales activity and production during the fourth quarter of 2016 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 the decrease in current liabilities was primarily due to the maturity of our euro note b in february 2016 

debt and credit facilities   the 696 million decrease in total debt at december 31 2016  as compared to december 31 2015  resulted from net debt repayments of 698 million which included the maturity of our euro note b partially offset by a reduction of 02 million in unamortized debt issuance costs 

our sources of liquidity include our credit facility at december 31 2016 we had 264 million in outstanding longterm borrowings under this facility of which 43 million was denominated in yen and 221 million was denominated in euro these borrowings together with outstanding letters of credit of 30 million resulted in a borrowing capacity available under our credit facility of 2706 million at december 31 2016 we do not expect any significant limitations on our ability to access this source of funds please refer to note 8 debt  for further discussion of our credit facility 

pursuant to the financial covenants in our debt agreements we are required to maintain established interest coverage ratios and to not exceed established leverage ratios in addition the agreements contain other customary covenants none of which we consider restrictive to our operations at december 31 2016 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements throughout 2017 

we believe that cash on hand and cash generated from operations together with availability under our credit facility will be adequate to address our foreseeable liquidity needs based on our current expectations of our business operations capital expenditures and scheduled payments of debt obligations 

commitments and contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our commitments and contractual obligations at december 31 2016  these obligations are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity 



 

 

 

 

reserves for uncertain tax positions   the table above does not include 62 million  of total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2016  due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for amounts which may be paid 

letters of credit   we have letters of credit totaling 30 million  supporting the reimbursement of workers compensation and other claims paid on our behalf by insurance carriers our accrual for insurance obligations was 44 million  at december 31 2016  of which 12 million  is in excess of our deductible and therefore is reimbursable by the insurance company 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2016  we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases unconditional purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business and outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

managements discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with us gaap the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions some of which are subjective and complex that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our results of operations and financial position 

revenue recognition  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists title and risk of loss have transferred the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured generally sales are recognized upon shipment or upon delivery to our customers site based upon shipping terms or legal requirements some customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes we record rebate costs when sales occur based on our assessment of the likelihood that the required volumes will be attained we also maintain an allowance for product returns as we believe that we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of returns based on our substantial historical experience 

impairment of longlived assets longlived assets including property plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable an asset is considered impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future expected undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset once an asset is considered impaired an impairment loss is recorded within other expense income for the difference between the assets carrying value and its fair value for assets held and used in the business management determines fair value using estimated future cash flows to be derived from the asset discounted to a net present value using an appropriate discount rate for assets held for sale or for investment purposes management determines fair value by estimating the proceeds to be received upon sale of the asset less disposition costs during 2016 as part of our restructuring plan we recorded within other expense a 45 million noncash asset writedown associated with the discontinued use of certain equipment 

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually following the completion of our annual budget and longrange planning process or whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is the same as or one level below our operating segments recent accounting guidance allows entities to first assess qualitative factors including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors and overall financial performance to determine whether it is necessary to perform the first step of the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test we considered this guidance when performing our annual impairment testing but elected to continue utilizing the twostep quantitative impairment test the first step in the twostep test is to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill if the carrying amount exceeds fair value the second step must be performed the second step requires the comparison of the carrying amount of the goodwill to its implied fair value which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired as of the testing date any excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the implied fair value would represent an impairment loss considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test such as future sales future cash flows and longterm growth rates are consistent with internal projections and operating plans amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test are also largely dependent on the continued sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products as well as our timeliness and success in newproduct innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems changes in the estimate of fair value including the estimate of future cash flows could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position no impairment in the carrying value of our reporting units was evident as a result of our annual review of goodwill and each of our reporting units had a fair value in excess of its carrying value of at least 180 

at december 31 2015 a trademark had been determined to have an indefinite life and therefore was not subject to amortization during 2016 as part of our restructuring plan we recorded within other expense a 100 million noncash asset writedown associated with the discontinued use of this trademark 

intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable during 2016 as part of our restructuring plan we recorded within other expense a 28 million noncash asset writedown associated with the discontinued use of a patent 

employee benefits  we maintain funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans in the us and a number of other countries that cover employees who meet eligibility requirements in addition we sponsor postretirement benefit plans which provide healthcare benefits for eligible employees who retire or become disabled the measurement of annual cost and obligations under these defined benefit postretirement plans is subject to a number of assumptions which are specific for each of our us and foreign plans the assumptions which are reviewed at least annually are relevant to both the plan assets where applicable and the obligation for benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees two of the most critical assumptions in determining pension and retiree medical plan expense are the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement age rates of compensation increases mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience for our funded plans we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our plan assets as well as historical and expected rates of return in estimating the longterm rate of return on plan assets under us gaap differences between actual and expected results are generally accumulated in other comprehensive income loss as actuarial gains or losses and subsequently amortized into earnings over future periods 

changes in key assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position we estimate that every 25 basis point reduction in our longterm rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by 04 million and every 25 basis point reduction in our discount rate would increase pension expense by 06 million a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations our net pension underfunded balance at december 31 2016  was 698 million compared to 574 million at december 31 2015  our underfunded balance for other postretirement benefits was 80 million at december 31 2016  compared to 102 million at december 31 2015  

income taxes  we estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation in addition deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established to recognize differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities we maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized the recoverability of tax assets is subject to our estimates of future profitability generally at the respective subsidiary company and country level changes in tax legislation business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined 

  

when accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements we apply a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 

contingent consideration 

the fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to the smartdose technology platform the “smartdose contingent consideration” was initially determined using a probabilityweighted income approach and is revalued at each reporting date or more frequently if circumstances dictate changes in the fair value of this obligation are recorded as income or expense within other expense income in our consolidated statements of income the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration are the sales projections the probability of success factors and the discount rate significant increases or decreases in any of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement as development and commercialization of the smartdose technology platform progresses we may need to update the sales projections the probability of success factors and the discount rate used this could result in a material increase or decrease to the contingent consideration liability 

see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 2 new accounting standards  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on accounting and reporting standards considered in the preparation and presentation of our financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risk factors such as fluctuating interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and increasing commodity prices these risk factors can impact our results of operations cash flows and financial position to manage these risks we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps call options and forward exchange contracts for periods consistent with and for notional amounts equal to or less than the underlying exposures in accordance with company policy derivative financial instruments are not used for investment or trading purposes 

foreign currency exchange risk 

sales outside of the us accounted for 511  of consolidated net sales in 2016  virtually all of these sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into usd for consolidated reporting purposes although the majority of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary they may also hold assets or liabilities denominated in other currencies these items may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains and losses as a result our results of operations and financial position are exposed to changing currency exchange rates we periodically use forward contracts to hedge certain transactions or to neutralize monthend balance sheet exposures on crosscurrency intercompany loans 

we have designated our €210 million eurodenominated borrowings under our credit facility as a hedge of our net investment in certain european subsidiaries we also have ¥5000 million in yendenominated borrowings under our credit facility which has been designated as a hedge of our net investment in daikyo at december 31 2016  a cumulative foreign currency translation gain on these hedges of 11 million net of tax of 06 million was recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss 

interest rate risk    

as a result of our normal borrowing activities we have longterm debt with both fixed and variable interest rates longterm debt consists of senior notes revolving credit facilities and capital lease obligations our exposures to fluctuations in interest rates are managed to the extent considered necessary by entering into interest rate swap agreements 

the following table summarizes our interest rate risksensitive instruments 



1 as of december 31 2016  we have a forwardstart interest rate swap outstanding designed to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the applicable interest rate of our 349 million  fiveyear term loan at december 31 2016  this agreement had a fair value of 10 million  unfavorable to us which was recorded as a noncurrent liability please refer to note 9 derivative financial instruments  for additional information on this interest rate hedge 

commodity price risk 

many of our proprietary products are made from synthetic elastomers which are derived from the petroleum refining process we purchase the majority of our elastomers via longterm supply contracts some of which contain clauses that provide for surcharges related to fluctuations in crude oil prices in recent years raw material costs have fluctuated due to crude oil price fluctuations we expect this volatility to continue we will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects on gross profit 

in february 2016 we purchased a series of call options for a total of 71900  barrels of crude oil to mitigate our exposure to such oilbased surcharges and protect operating cash flows with regards to a portion of our forecasted elastomer purchases through november 2016 with these contracts in 2016 we benefited 04 million due to increases in crude oil prices offset by the 02 million premium that we paid to purchase the contracts 

in november 2016 we purchased a series of call options for a total of 96525 barrels of crude oil through november 2017 during 2016 the gain recorded in cost of goods and services sold related to these options was less than 01 million

business segments 

in 2015 our business operations consisted of two reportable segments the pharmaceutical packaging systems segment packaging systems and the pharmaceutical delivery systems segment “delivery systems” beginning in 2016 we are changing our organization and reporting structure for our next phase of growth and development which will result in a change to proprietary products and contractmanufactured products as reportable segments the proprietary products reportable segment which will combine the existing packaging systems segment with the proprietary products portion of the existing delivery systems segment will develop commercial operational and innovation strategies across our global network with specific emphasis on product offerings to biologic generic and pharmaceutical customers the contractmanufactured products reportable segment which will consist of the contract manufacturing portion of the existing delivery systems segment will serve as a fully integrated business focused on the design manufacture and automated assembly of complex assemblies for pharmaceutical and medical device customers 

the information and discussion included in this form 10k reflects the structure in place as of december 31 2015 

packaging systems segment 

our packaging systems segment includes primary packaging components and systems for injectable drug delivery including stoppers and seals for vials closures and other components used in syringe intravenous and blood collection systems and prefillable syringe components the growth strategy for packaging systems includes organic growth through market segmentation newproduct innovation strategic acquisitions and geographic expansion we have manufacturing facilities in north and south america europe and asia pacific with affiliated companies in mexico and japan see item 2 properties    for additional information on our manufacturing and other sites 

packaging systems consists of three operating segments  americas europe and asia pacific  which are aggregated for reporting purposes 

packaging systems products generally consist of elastomeric components offered in a variety of standard and customerspecific configurations and formulations which are available with advanced barrier films and coatings to enhance their performance west flurotec ®  barrier film is applied to reduce the risk of product loss by contamination and protect the shelf life of packaged drugs we also apply a fluoropolymer laminate to the surface of stoppers and plungers to improve compatibility between the closure and the drug b2coating is a coating applied to the surface of stoppers and plungers which eliminates the need for conventional silicone application it helps manufacturers reduce product rejections due to trace levels of silicone molecules found in noncoated packaged drug compounds flurotec and b2coating technologies are licensed from daikyo 

in addition our westar ®  rs and westar ®  ru postmanufacturing processes are documented and fully validated procedures for washing siliconizing and sterilizing stoppers and syringe components the westar rs process prepares components for introduction into the customers sterilizer and the westar ru process provides sterilized components these processes increase the overall efficiency of injectable drug production by outsourcing component processing thereby eliminating steps otherwise required in our customers manufacturing processes and help to assure compliance with the latest regulatory requirements for component preparation we also offer envision™ components that are inspected using automated vision inspection systems ensuring that components plungers and stoppers meet enhanced quality specifications for visible and subvisible particulate contamination in 2015 we launched daikyo ruv components which are manufactured using clean highquality elastomer formulations and then washed camerainspected and sterilized to help reduce the customer’s manufacturing footprint streamline processes minimize risks around component preparation and eliminate bioburden 

our novapure ®  components which include serum and lyophilization stoppers and syringe plungers incorporate quality by design principles and are manufactured utilizing advanced process technologies the closures provide the highest levels of quality to the market helping to ensure the safety efficacy and purity of injectable drug products 

our tamperevident flipoff ®  seals are sold in a wide range of sizes and colors to meet customers needs for product identification and differentiation the seals can be provided using proprietary printing for cautionary statements and embossing technology that can serve as a counterfeiting deterrence our newest sterile drug vial seal the flipoff plus ru seal provides drug manufacturers around the world with readytouse highquality seals that consistently achieve reproducible and safe container integrity for drug products while minimizing levels of bioburden and particulates 

as an adjunct to our packaging systems products we offer contract analytical laboratory services for testing and evaluating primary drugpackaging components and their compatibility with the contained drug formulation west analytical services provides customers with indepth knowledge and analysis of the interaction and compatibility of drug products with elastomer glass and plastic packaging components our analytical laboratories also provide specialized testing for complete drug delivery systems 

see note 17 segment information  for net sales and asset information for packaging systems 

delivery systems segment 

our delivery systems segment includes safety and administration systems multicomponent systems for drug containment and administration and a variety of custom contractmanufacturing solutions targeted to the healthcare and consumerproducts industries delivery systems has expertise in product design and development including inhouse mold design and construction an engineering center for developmental and prototype tooling process design and validation and highspeed automated assemblies in addition delivery systems is responsible for the continued development and commercialization of our line of proprietary healthcare administrative and advanced injection systems including daikyo cz ®  smartdose ®  and other systems delivery systems has manufacturing operations in north america and europe see item 2 properties  for additional information on our manufacturing and other sites 

delivery systems includes a variety of products and services which are described below 

the daikyo cz 1ml long insert needle syringe system is the markets first polymer syringe system without silicone oil lubrication applied to the barrel or plunger that incorporates an insertmolded needle to avoid the need for adhesive the luer lock version of the daikyo cz syringe system was introduced previously along with several sizes of sterile vials additional sizes of vials continue to be introduced cz technology is licensed from daikyo 

the development of our smartdose electronic wearable injector continues to gain momentum in the marketplace with multiple active development programs in place this system is designed for controlled subcutaneous delivery of high volume and high viscosity drugs using prefillable daikyo cz cartridges the system is fully programmable has a single pushbutton operation and a hidden needle for safety 

the confidose ®  autoinjector and selfdose tm  selfinjection systems enhance patient compliance and safety the needle remains automatically shielded at all times these systems eliminate preparation steps and simplify the injection of drugs providing patients with a sterile singleuse disposable system that can be readily used at home 

our administration systems include sterile devices for the preparation and administration of drug products including patented products such as the mixject ®  transfer device the mix2vial ®  needleless reconstitution system the vial2bag ® system and a variety of vial adapters 

examples of our safety systems that are designed to prevent needle sticks are éris™ and novaguard ® sa for prefilled syringes and novaguard ®  lp for luer lock syringes 

we offer customer contractmanufacturing and assembly solutions which use such technologies as multicomponent molding inmold labeling ultrasonic welding and clean room molding and device assembly used to manufacture customerowned components and devices used in surgical diagnostic ophthalmic other drug delivery systems and consumer products 

see note 17 segment information  for net sales and asset information for delivery systems 

international 

we have significant operations outside of the united states us which are managed through the same business segments as our us operations – packaging systems and delivery systems sales outside of the us accounted for 520  of consolidated net sales in 2015  for a geographic breakdown of sales see note 17 segment information  

although the general business processes are similar to the domestic business international operations are exposed to additional risks these risks include currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar usd multiple tax jurisdictions and particularly in south america and israel political and social issues that could destabilize local markets and affect the demand for our products 

see further discussion of our international operations the risks associated with our international operations and our attempt to minimize some of these risks in part i item 1a risk factors  part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resources part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  note 1   under the captions financial instruments  and foreign currency translation and note 9 derivative financial instruments  

raw materials 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers aluminum and plastic elastomers include both natural and synthetic materials we currently have access to adequate supplies of these raw materials to meet our production needs through agreements with suppliers 

we employ a supplychain management strategy in our business segments which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply due to regulatory control over our production processes and the cost and time involved in qualifying suppliers we rely on singlesource suppliers for many critical raw materials we purchase certain of our raw materials in the open market this strategy increases the risk that our supply chain may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production problem these risks are managed where possible by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites rigorous quality control systems surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in case of an interruption in production 

intellectual property 

intellectual property including patents trade secrets and knowhow is important to our business we own or license intellectual property rights including issued patents and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries that relate to various aspects of our products in particular key valueadded and proprietary products and processes are licensed from daikyo our intellectual property rights have been useful in establishing our market share and in the growth of our business and are expected to continue to be of value in the future 

seasonality 

although our packaging systems business is not inherently seasonal sales and operating profit in the second half of the year are typically lower than the first half primarily due to scheduled plant shutdowns in conjunction with our customers production schedules and the yearend impact of holidays on production 

our delivery systems business is not inherently seasonal 

working capital 

we are required to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet customer requirements in addition some of our supply agreements require us to purchase inventory in bulk orders which increases inventory levels but decreases the risk of supply interruption levels of inventory are also influenced by the seasonal patterns addressed above for a more detailed discussion of working capital please see the discussion in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resource s 

marketing 

our packaging systems customers include most of the major branded pharmaceutical generic and biopharmaceutical companies in the world packaging systems components and other products are sold to major pharmaceutical biotechnology and hospital supplymedical device companies which incorporate them into their products for distribution to the ultimate enduser 

our delivery systems segment sells to many of the worlds largest pharmaceutical biopharmaceutical and medical device companies and to large customers within the consumer and foodandbeverage industries delivery systems components generally are incorporated into our customers manufacturing lines for further processing or assembly 

our products and services are distributed primarily through our own sales force and distribution network with limited use of contract sales agents and regional distributors 

our ten largest customers accounted for 420  of our consolidated net sales in 2015  but none of these customers individually accounted for more than 10 of net sales see note 17 segment information  for information on sales by significant product group 

order backlog 

order backlog includes firm orders placed by customers for manufacture over a period of time according to their schedule or upon confirmation by the customer we also have contractual arrangements with a number of our customers products covered by these contracts are included in our backlog only as orders are received order backlog may be positively or negatively impacted by several factors including customer ordering patterns and the necessary leadtime to deliver customer orders order backlog is one of many measures we use to understand future demand and should not be considered in isolation to predict future sales growth 

at december 31 2015 and 2014 the order backlog for packaging systems was 4132 million and 3397 million respectively the increase in backlog primarily reflects changes in customer ordering patterns and extended leadtimes for certain highvalue products partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency impact in 2015 we had orders being placed further in advance by certain customers some as much as a year while others focused more on shortterm stockbuilding the entire order backlog for packaging systems at december 31 2015 is expected to be filled during 2016 

the majority of delivery systems manufacturing activity is governed by contractual volume expectations with terms between one and three years subject to periodic revisions based on customer requirements 

competition 

we compete with several companies across our packaging systems product lines because of the special nature of our pharmaceutical packaging components and our longstanding participation in the market competition is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive costcontrol programs across their operations 

we differentiate ourselves from our competition as an integrated drug packaging and delivery systems global supplier that can provide presale primary packaging support and engineering development analytical services 

regulatory expertise and aftersale technical support customers also appreciate the global scope of wests manufacturing capability and our ability to produce many products at multiple sites 

our delivery systems business operates in very competitive markets for both healthcare and consumer products the competition varies from smaller regional companies to large global molders given the extreme cost pressures they face many of our customers look offshore to reduce cost we differentiate ourselves by leveraging our global capability and by employing new technologies such as highspeed automated assembly insertmolding multishot molding and expertise with multiplepiece closure systems 

there are a small number of competitors supplying medical devices and medical devices components we compete for this market on the basis of our reputation for quality and reliability in engineering and project management diverse contract manufacturing capabilities and knowledge of and experience in complying with us food and drug administration fda requirements we also have specialized knowledge of container and closure components which is integral to developing delivery systems with our range of proprietary technologies we compete with new and established companies in the area of drug delivery devices including suppliers of prefillable syringes autoinjectors safety needles and other proprietary systems 

research and development activities 

we maintain our own researchscale production facilities and laboratories for developing new products and offer contract engineering design and development services to assist customers with new product development our quality control regulatory and laboratory testing capabilities are used to ensure compliance with applicable manufacturing and regulatory standards for primary and secondary pharmaceutical packaging components the engineering departments are responsible for product and tooling design and testing and for the design and construction of processing equipment we continue to seek new innovative opportunities for acquisition licensing partnering or development of products services and technologies that serve the injectable drug containment and delivery market research and development spending will continue to increase as we pursue innovative strategic platforms in prefillable syringes injectable containers advanced injection and safety and administration systems 

commercial development of our new products and services for medical and pharmaceutical applications commonly requires several years new products that we develop may require separate approval as medical devices and products that are intended to be used in the packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical products will be subject to both customer acceptance of our products and regulatory approval of the customers products following our development period 

we spent 144 million  in 2015  163 million  in 2014  and 151 million  in 2013  on research and development for packaging systems delivery systems incurred research and development costs of 197 million  210 million  and 228 million  in the years 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2015  and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes in 2016 

employees 

as of december 31 2015  we employed approximately 7100  people in our operations throughout the world 




 item 1a risk factors 

the statements in this section describe major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this form 10k contains some forwardlooking statements that are based on managements beliefs and assumptions current expectations estimates and forecasts we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forwardlooking statements such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts we have attempted wherever possible to identify forwardlooking statements by using words such as “estimate” “expect” “intend” “believe” “plan” “anticipate” and other words and terms of similar meaning in particular these include statements relating to future actions business plans and prospects new products future performance or results of current or anticipated products sales efforts expenses interest rates foreignexchange rates economic effects the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results 

many of the factors that will determine our future results are beyond our ability to control or predict achievement of future results is subject to known or unknown risks or uncertainties and therefore actual results could differ materially from past results and those expressed or implied in any forwardlooking statement you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements 

unless required by applicable securities law we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise we also refer you to further disclosures we make on related subjects in our quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k to the sec 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 

the current uncertainty in the global economy including the continuing effects of recession or slow economic growth in the us europe and emerging markets in asia and south america may negatively affect our operating results examples of the effects of these continuing global economic challenges include our suppliers and our customers inability to access the credit markets at commercially reasonable rates reduction in sales due to customers decreasing their inventories in the nearterm or longterm or due to liquidity difficulties reduction in sales due to shortages of materials we purchase from our suppliers reduction in research and development efforts and expenditures by our customers our inability to hedge our currency and raw material risks sufficiently or at commercially reasonable prices insolvency of suppliers or customers inflationary pressures on our supplies or our products and increased expenses due to growing taxation of corporate profits or revenues our operating results in one or more geographic regions may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region if economic and market conditions in the us europe or in emerging markets weaken further we may experience material adverse impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our sales and profitability are largely dependent on the sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products if the products developed by our customers in the future use another delivery system our sales and profitability could suffer 

our business depends to a substantial extent on customers continued sales and development of products that are delivered by injection if our customers fail to continue to sell develop and deploy injectable products or we are unable to develop new products that assist in the delivery of drugs by alternative methods our sales and profitability may suffer 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

our business is subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations sales outside of the us accounted for 520  of our consolidated net sales in 2015  and we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales in the future in addition many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the us further we intend to continue our expansion into emerging andor fastergrowing markets outside of the us in the future virtually all of our international sales assets and related operating costs and expenses are earned valued or incurred in the currency of the local country primarily the euro the singapore dollar and the danish krone in addition we are exposed to japanese yen yen as we maintain a 25 ownership interest in and we purchase finished goods and other materials from daikyo we are also exposed to currencies in emerging market countries such as the chinese yuan the indian rupee and various south american currencies including the venezuelan bolivar and the brazilian real our consolidated financial statements are presented in usd and therefore we must translate the reported values of our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses into usd which can result in significant fluctuations in the amount of those assets liabilities revenues or expenses the exchange rates between these foreign currencies and usd in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future increases or decreases in the value of usd compared to these foreign currencies may negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

in addition to translation risks we incur currency transaction risk when we or one of our subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction in a currency other than that entitys local currency in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in certain exchange rates we have entered and expect to continue to enter into hedging arrangements including the use of financial derivatives there can be no certainty that we will be able to enter into or maintain hedges of these currency risks or that our hedges will be effective which could have a significant effect on our financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to provide comparative value advantages timely fulfillment of customer orders or resist pricing pressure we will have to reduce our prices which may reduce our profit margins 

we compete with several companies across our major product lines because of the special nature of these products competition is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive costcontrol programs across their operations competitors often compete on the basis of price we differentiate ourselves from our competition as a fullservice valueadded global supplier that is able to provide presale compatibility studies and other services and sophisticated postsale technical support on a global basis however we face continued pricing pressure from our customers and competitors if we are unable to resist or to offset the effects of continued pricing pressure through our valueadded services improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures or if we have to reduce our prices our sales and profitability may suffer 

consolidation in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries have experienced a significant amount of consolidation as a result of this consolidation competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased in addition group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has placed pricing pressure on suppliers further consolidation within the industries we serve could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products 

we are subject to regulation by governments around the world and if these regulations are not complied with existing and future operations may be curtailed and we could be subject to liability 

the design development manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our products and our customers products that incorporate our products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the us europe and other countries including the fda and the european medicines agency complying with governmental regulation can be costly and can result in required modification or withdrawal of existing products and a substantial delay in the introduction of new products failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or failure to obtain regulatory approval for a new product could result in expenses and actions that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

products incorporating our technologies are subject to regulations and extensive approval or clearance processes which make the timing and success of newproduct commercialization difficult to predict 

the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is expensive and timeconsuming historically most medical devices incorporating our technologies have been subject to the fdas 510k marketing approval process which typically lasts from six to nine months supplemental or full premarket approval reviews require a significantly longer period delaying commercialization pharmaceutical products incorporating our technologies are subject to the fdas new drug application process which typically takes a number of years to complete additionally biotechnology products incorporating our technologies are subject to the fdas biologics license application process which also typically takes a number of years to complete outside of the us sales of medical devices and pharmaceutical or biotechnology products are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary from country to country the time required to obtain approval for sale internationally may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 

changes in the regulation of drug products and devices may increase competitive pressure and adversely affect our business 

an effect of the governmental regulation of our customers drug products devices and manufacturing processes is that compliance with regulations makes it costly and timeconsuming for customers to substitute or replace components and devices produced by one supplier with those from another the regulation of our customers products that incorporate our components and devices has increased over time if the applicable regulations were to be modified in a way that reduced the cost and time involved for customers to substitute one suppliers components or devices for those made by another it is likely that the competitive pressure would increase and adversely affect our sales and profitability 

if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights we may harm our ability to compete 

our patents trademarks and other intellectual property are important to our business we rely on patent trademark copyright trade secret and other intellectual property laws as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary information technologies and processes we also have obligations with respect to the nonuse and nondisclosure of third party intellectual property we may need to engage in litigation or similar activities to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others any such litigation could require us to expend significant resources and divert the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel from our business operations we cannot assure you that the steps we will take to prevent misappropriation infringement or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of others will be successful in addition effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for some of our intellectual property in some countries failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business and results of operations in addition if relevant and effective patent protection is not available or has expired we may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar or duplicative to ours 

disruption in our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make and sell products and have a negative impact on our reputation performance or financial condition 

we have manufacturing sites throughout the world in addition in some instances the manufacturing of certain product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants the functioning of our manufacturing and distribution assets and systems could be disrupted for reasons either within or beyond our control including extreme weather or longerterm climatic changes natural disasters pandemic war accidental damage disruption to the supply of material or services product quality and safety issues systems failure workforce actions or environmental contamination there is a risk that incident management systems in place may prove inadequate and that any disruption may materially adversely affect our ability to make and sell products and therefore materially adversely affect our reputation performance or financial condition 

the medical technology industry is very competitive and customer demands andor new products in the marketplace could cause a reduction in demand 

the medical technology industry is subject to rapid technological changes and we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold we face this competition from a wide range of companies these include large medical device companies some of which have greater financial and marketing resources than we do we also face competition from firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets in some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for diseases that may be delivered without a medical device the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology may render some of our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive in addition failure to meet increased customer quality expectations could cause a reduction in demand 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that vary by country and which could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

we conduct business in most of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world our international operations and our ability to implement our overall business strategy including our plan to continue expanding into emerging andor fastergrowing markets outside of the us are subject to risks and uncertainties that can vary by country and include transportation delays and interruptions political and economic instability and disruptions imposition of duties and tariffs import and export controls the risks of divergent business expectations or cultural incompatibility inherent in establishing and maintaining operations in foreign countries difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations labor strikes andor disputes and potentially adverse tax consequences limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies with third parties or our joint venture partners outside of the us could also create exposure in addition we may not be able to operate in compliance with foreign laws and regulations or comply with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject in the event that these laws or regulations change any of these events could have an adverse effect on our international operations in the future by reducing the demand for our products decreasing the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

disruptions in the supply of key raw materials could adversely impact our operations 

we generally purchase our raw materials and supplies required for the production of our products in the open market for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability or cost effectiveness many components and raw materials are available andor purchased only from a single supplier due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for these components or materials or do so without excessive cost as a result a reduction or interruption in manufacturing or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

raw material and energy prices have a significant impact on our profitability if raw material andor energy prices increase and we cannot pass those price increases on to our customers our profitability and financial condition may suffer 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers which include synthetic and natural material aluminum and plastic in addition our manufacturing facilities consume a wide variety of energy products to fuel heat and cool our operations supply and demand factors which are beyond our control generally affect the price of our raw materials and utility costs if we are unable to pass along increased raw material prices and energy costs to our customers our profitability and thus our financial condition may be adversely affected the prices of many of these raw materials and utilities are cyclical and volatile for example the prices of certain commodities particularly petroleumbased raw materials have in the recent past exhibited rapid changes affecting the cost of synthetic elastomers and plastic while we generally attempt to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of sales price increases historically there has been a time delay between raw material andor energy price increases and our ability to increase the prices of our products in some circumstances we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pressure and other factors 

if we are not timely or successful in newproduct innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems our future revenues and operating income could be adversely affected 

our growth partly depends on newproduct innovation and the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications such as the daikyo cz readytouse prefilled syringes and the smartdose systems product development and commercialization is inherently uncertain and is subject to a number of factors outside of our control including any necessary regulatory approvals and commercial acceptance for the products the ultimate timing and successful commercialization of new products and systems requires substantial evaluations of the functional operational clinical and economic viability of the companys products in addition the timely and adequate availability of filling capacity is essential to both conducting definitive stability trials and the timing of first commercialization of customers products in cz prefilled syringes delays interruptions or failures in developing and commercializing newproduct innovations or proprietary multicomponent systems could adversely affect future revenues and operating income in addition adverse conditions may also result in future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we may not succeed in finding and completing acquisition or other strategic transactions if any which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we have historically engaged in acquisition activity and we may in the future engage in acquisitions or other strategic transactions such as joint ventures or investments in other entities we may be unable to identify suitable targets opportunistic or otherwise for acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future if we identify a suitable candidate our ability to successfully implement the strategic transaction would depend on a variety of factors including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and to comply with the restrictions contained in our debt agreements strategic transactions involve risks including those associated with integrating the operations or maintaining the operations as separate as applicable financial reporting disparate technologies and personnel of acquired companies joint ventures or related companies managing geographically dispersed operations or other strategic investments the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience unknown risks and the potential loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies joint ventures or companies in which we may make strategic investments we may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire or strategically develop in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits relating to any such strategic transactions strategic transactions may be expensive time consuming and may strain our resources strategic transactions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of among other things the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and amortization expenses of other intangible assets in addition strategic transactions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities 

product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 

the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects unanticipated use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market a recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals 

our operations must comply with environmental statutes and regulations and any failure to comply could result in extensive costs which would harm our business 

the manufacture of some of our products involves the use transportation storage and disposal of hazardous or toxic materials and is subject to various environmental protection and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate this has exposed us in the past and could expose us in the future to risks of accidental contamination and events of noncompliance with environmental laws any such occurrences could result in regulatory enforcement or personal injury and property damage claims or could lead to a shutdown of some of our operations which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations we currently incur costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations and these costs may become more significant 

a loss of key personnel or highly skilled employees could disrupt our operations 

our executive officers are critical to the management and direction of our businesses our future success depends in large part on our ability to retain these officers and other key employees including people in technical marketing sales and research positions competition for experienced employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees our business could be adversely affected although we believe that we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise our inability to do so on a timely basis could disrupt the operations of the unit affected or our overall operations in addition because of the complex nature of many of our products and programs we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled engineering staff and workforce our operations could be disrupted by a shortage of available skilled employees 

the uncertain effects of potential climate change legislation could lead to significantly increased costs 

if legislation or regulations are enacted or promulgated in the us europe or asia or any other jurisdictions in which we do business that limit or reduce allowable greenhouse gas emissions and other emissions such restrictions could have a significant effect on our operating and financial decisions including those involving capital expenditures to reduce emissions and our results of operations our manufacturing operations may not be able to operate as planned if we are not able to comply with new legal and regulatory legislation around climate change or it may become too costly to operate in a profitable manner additionally suppliers added expenses could be passed on to us in the form of higher prices and we may not be able to pass on such expenses to our customers through price increases 

federal healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations 

the patient protection and affordable care act the “ppaca” was enacted in march 2010 the ppaca reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures these factors in turn could result in reduced demand for our products and increased downward pricing pressure it is also possible that the ppaca will result in lower reimbursements for our customers products while the ppaca is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the us the impact of any overall increase in access to healthcare on sales of wests products is uncertain at this time our sales depend in part on the extent to which pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities private insurers and other thirdparty payers for the costs of our products the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers which can vary among public and private sources may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these products in a particular jurisdiction legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the us as part of the ppaca or abroad for example those under consideration in france germany italy and the united kingdom could significantly reduce reimbursement for our customers products which could in turn reduce the demand for our products 

moreover in the coming years additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our products we will continue to evaluate the ppaca as amended the implementation of regulations or guidance related to various provisions of the ppaca by federal agencies as well as trends and changes that may be encouraged by the legislation and that may potentially impact our business over time 

no assurance can be given that we will continue to pay or declare dividends 

we have historically paid dividends however there can be no assurance that we will pay or declare dividends in the future the actual declaration and payment of future dividends the amount of any such dividends and the establishment of record and payment dates if any are subject to determination by our board of directors each quarter after its review of our thencurrent strategy applicable debt covenants and financial performance and position among other things our declaration and payment of future dividends is subject to risks and uncertainties including deterioration of our financial performance or position inability to declare a dividend in compliance with applicable laws or debt covenants an increase in our cash needs or decrease in available cash and the business judgment of the board of directors that a declaration of a dividend is not in the companys best interests 

our results of operations and earnings may not meet guidance or expectations  

we provide public guidance on our expected results of operations for future periods this guidance is comprised of forwardlooking statements subject to risks and uncertainties including the risks and uncertainties described in this form 10k and in our other public filings and public statements and is based necessarily on assumptions we make at the time we provide such guidance our guidance may not always be accurate if in the future our results of operations for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or if we reduce our guidance for future periods the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 

we are exposed to credit risk on accounts receivable and certain prepayments made in the normal course of business this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

a substantial majority of our outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance in addition we have made prepayments associated with insurance premiums and other advances in the normal course of business while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on trade receivables and other current assets there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk and avoid losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

unauthorized access to our or our customers information and systems could negatively impact our business 

we may face certain security threats including threats to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data and systems we maintain an extensive network of technical security controls policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems in order to address these threats while these measures are designed to prevent detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems certain types of attacks could result in financial or information losses andor reputational harm if we cannot prevent the unauthorized access release andor corruption of our or our customers confidential classified or personally identifiable information our reputation could be damaged andor we could face financial losses 

if we fail to comply with our obligations under our distributorship or license agreements with daikyo or we are unable to renew these agreements on the same or substantially similar terms we could lose license rights that are important to our business 

key valueadded and proprietary products and processes are licensed from our affiliate daikyo including but not limited to daikyo cz flurotec and b2coating technologies our rights to these products and processes are licensed pursuant to agreements that expire in 2017 which we expect to renew prior to their expiration however if we are unsuccessful in renewing these agreements or if the agreements are terminated early because we fail to satisfy our obligations our business could be adversely impacted

nonus gaap financial measures 

for the purpose of aiding the comparison of our yearoveryear results we may refer to net sales and other financial results excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates the constantcurrency amounts are calculated by translating the current year’s functional currency results at the prioryear period’s exchange rate we may also refer to consolidated operating profit and consolidated operating profit margin excluding the effects of unallocated items the remeasured results excluding effects from currency translation and excluding the effects of unallocated items are not in conformity with us gaap and should not be used as a substitute for the comparable us gaap financial measures the nonus gaap financial measures are incorporated into our discussion and analysis as management uses them in evaluating our results of operations and believes that this information provides users a valuable insight into our results 

our operations 

we are a manufacturer of components and systems for the packaging and delivery of injectable drugs as well as components for the pharmaceutical healthcare and consumer products industries our products include stoppers and seals for vials prefillable syringe components and systems components for intravenous and blood collection systems safety and administration systems advanced injection systems and contract design and manufacturing services our customers include the leading global producers of pharmaceuticals biologics medical devices and consumer products we were incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania on july 27 1923 

our business operations are organized into two reportable segments packaging systems and delivery systems packaging systems develops manufactures and sells primary packaging components and systems for injectable drug delivery including stoppers and seals for vials closures and other components used in syringe intravenous and blood collection systems and prefillable syringe components delivery systems develops manufactures and sells safety and administration systems multicomponent systems for drug administration and a variety of custom contractmanufacturing solutions targeted to the healthcare and consumerproducts industries in addition delivery systems is responsible for the continued development and commercialization of our line of proprietary multicomponent systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications we also maintain global partnerships to share technologies and market products with affiliates in japan and mexico 

our 2015 results were affected by the weakening of the euro and other foreign currencies in relation to usd as a result of our global manufacturing and distribution presence more than half of our revenues are generated outside of the us in currencies other than usd including approximately 40 in europe and 10 collectively in asia and south america fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates therefore can have a significant effect on our consolidated financial results generally our financial results are affected positively by a weaker usd and negatively by a stronger usd as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business in terms of net sales the most significant foreign currencies are the euro the singapore dollar and the danish krone with eurodenominated sales representing the majority of sales transacted in foreign currencies in addition we are exposed to yen as we maintain a 25 ownership interest in and we purchase finished goods and other materials from daikyo during 2015 average exchange rates were unfavorable versus the exchange rates realized in 2014 resulting in lower reported net sales operating profit net income and net income per diluted share of 1239 million 293 million 214 million and 029 respectively as compared to 2014 the average euro to usd exchange rate decreased from 133 for 2014 to 111 for 2015 

our 2015 results also include a 504 million pension settlement charge which reduced net income and net income per diluted share by 320 million and 043 respectively as compared to 2014 a 109 million charge for executive retirement and related costs which lowered net income and net income per diluted share by 69 million and 009 respectively as compared to 2014 and a discrete tax charge of 08 million which reduced net income and net income per diluted share by 08 million and 001 respectively compared to 2014 

excluding foreign currency effects the pension settlement charge the executive retirement charge and the discrete tax charge our net sales and net income per diluted share increased by 72 and 211 respectively for 2015 as compared to 2014 at december 31 2015 our cash and cash equivalents balance totaled 2746 million and our borrowing capacity under our senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility agreement the new credit agreement was 2699 million the new credit agreement expires in october 2020 

2016 organizational structure change and business outlook 

in 2015 our business operations consisted of two reportable segments as discussed above beginning in 2016 we are changing our organization and reporting structure for our next phase of growth and development which will result in a change to proprietary products and contractmanufactured products as reportable segments see part i item 1 business  of this form 10k for further discussion regarding the change in our organization and reporting structure 

we continue to focus on our customers increasing demand for higher product quality including the development of our proprietary packaging and delivery systems product offerings we will manage our capabilities and asset base to respond to changing markets and to enable improvements in service and quality we expect that contract manufacturing will remain focused on pharmaceutical and medical device customers we plan to continue funding capital projects related to new products expansion activity advanced quality systems and investment in emerging markets we believe that our strong operating results and financial position give us a platform for sustained growth and will enable us to take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business as they arise see part i item 1a risk factors  of this form 10k for further discussion regarding the risks associated with our operations 

on february 17 2016 the venezuelan government announced a devaluation of the bolivar from the official exchange rate of 63 bolivars to usd to 100 bolivars to usd and streamlined the previous threetiered currency exchange mechanism into a dual currency exchange mechanism please refer to note 18 subsequent events    for further discussion 

results of operations 

we evaluate the performance of our segments based upon among other things segment net sales and operating profit segment operating profit excludes general corporate costs which include executive and director compensation stockbased compensation adjustments to annual incentive plan expense for over or underattainment of targets certain pension and other retirement benefit costs and other corporate facilities and administrative expenses not allocated to the segments also excluded are items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations such items are referred to as other unallocated items and generally include restructuring and related charges certain asset impairments and other specificallyidentified income or expense items 

percentages in the following tables and throughout this results of operations  section may reflect rounding adjustments 

net sales 

the following table presents net sales consolidated and by reportable segment 



2015 compared to 2014 

consolidated net sales decreased by 216 million or 15 in 2015 including an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 1239 million excluding foreign currency effects consolidated net sales increased by 1023 million or 72 consolidated net sales originating in the us in 2015 were 6674 million an increase of 58 from 2014 consolidated net sales generated outside of the us mainly in europe in 2015 were 7324 million a decrease of 74 from 2014 due to an unfavorable foreign currency impact excluding foreign currency effects consolidated net sales generated outside of the us in 2015 increased by 83 

packaging systems – packaging systems net sales decreased by 190 million or 19 in 2015 including an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 1052 million excluding foreign currency effects net sales increased by 862 million or 85 due to growth in our highvalue product offerings particularly fluroteccoated components westar components and the envision line of visioninspected components an improvement in product mix and higher sales volumes contributed 69 percentage points of the increase and sales price increases contributed the remainder of the increase our highvalue product offerings represented 460 of packaging systems net sales in 2015 as compared to 436 in 2014 

delivery systems –  delivery systems net sales decreased by 23 million or 05 in 2015 including an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 187 million excluding foreign currency effects net sales increased by 164 million or 41 due to an increase in contract manufacturing sales particularly sales of glucose monitoring devices sales volumes contributed the entirety of the increase proprietary net sales represented 247 of delivery systems net sales in 2015 as compared to 262 in 2014 as net sales for smartdose were higher in 2014 due to clinical trials that have since concluded 

2014 compared to 2013 

consolidated net sales increased by 530 million or 39 in 2014 despite an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 55 million excluding foreign currency effects consolidated net sales increased by 585 million or 43 

packaging systems –  packaging systems’ net sales increased by 237 million or 24 in 2014 despite an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 57 million excluding foreign currency effects net sales increased by 294 million or 29 while overall growth in our highvalue product offerings continued customer inventory management actions due to regulatory issues and formulation changes reduced demand levels for teflon and fluroteccoated components resulting in a reduction in sales of these products in 2014 our highvalue product offerings represented 432 of packaging systems net sales for 2014 as compared to 429 in 2013 higher sales volumes and a moderate improvement in product mix contributed 21 percentage points of the increase and sales price increases contributed 08 percentage points of the increase 

delivery systems –  delivery systems’ net sales increased by 284 million or 76 in 2014 including a favorable foreign currency impact of 02 million excluding foreign currency effects net sales increased by 282 million or 75 primarily due to an increase in contract manufacturing sales proprietary reconstitution product sales and customerfunded clinical development sales of our smartdose component samples proprietary net sales represented 262 of delivery systems net sales for 2014 as compared to 248 in 2013 sales volume and product mix improvements contributed 71 percentage points of the increase and sales price increases contributed the remainder of the increase 

the intersegment sales elimination which is required for the presentation of consolidated net sales represents the elimination of components sold between our segments 

gross profit 

the following table presents gross profit and related gross margins consolidated and by reportable segment 



2015 compared to 2014 

consolidated gross profit increased by 80 million or 18 in 2015 despite an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 424 million consolidated gross margin increased by 11 margin points in 2015 

packaging systems –  packaging systems gross profit increased by 127 million or 34 in 2015 despite an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 371 million packaging systems gross margin increased by 19 margin points in 2015 as product mix improvements sales price increases and production efficiencies were partially offset by increased labor and overhead costs 

delivery systems – delivery systems gross profit decreased by 47 million or 60 in 2015 including an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 53 million delivery systems gross margin decreased by 11 margin points in 2015 as a result of increased overhead and depreciation related to new capabilities supporting both proprietary and contract manufacturing programs 

2014 compared to 2013 

consolidated gross profit increased by 131 million or 30 in 2014 despite an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 23 million consolidated gross margin decreased by 03 margin points in 2014 

packaging systems –  packaging systems’ gross profit increased by 76 million or 21 in 2014 despite an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 23 million packaging systems gross margin decreased by 01 margin points in 2014 as lower raw material costs and moderate sales price and product mix improvements were offset by increased employee compensation laboratory and engineering costs 

delivery systems –  delivery systems’ gross profit increased by 55 million or 75 in 2014 delivery systems’ gross margin remained constant at 196 as margin improvements from the increased proportion of proprietary products sold were offset by higher depreciation and overhead costs for these programs as well as startup costs on new contract manufacturing products 

research and development “rd” costs 

the following table presents rd costs consolidated and by reportable segment 



2015 compared to 2014

interest expense net 

the following table presents interest expense net by significant component 



2015 compared to 2014 

interest expense net decreased by 05 million or 38 in 2015 primarily due to lower interest expense resulting from less debt outstanding during 2015 partially offset by a decrease in interest income during 2014 we recorded 16 million in interest income following the settlement of a tax matter in brazil 

2014 compared to 2013 

interest expense net decreased by 21 million or 139 in 2014 primarily due to 16 million in interest income following the settlement of a tax matter in brazil and lower interest expense resulting from less debt outstanding during 2014 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes was 263 million 472 million and 402 million for the years 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively resulting in effective tax rates of 226 280 and 274 respectively 

the decrease in the effective tax rate for 2015 reflects the impact of a tax benefit of 184 million in connection with a 504 million pension settlement charge and a tax benefit of 40 million in connection with a 109 million charge for executive retirement and related costs partially offset by the impact of unfavorable changes in our geographic mix of earnings in addition during 2015 we recorded a discrete tax charge of 08 million resulting from the impact of a change in the enacted tax rate in the united kingdom on our previouslyrecorded deferred tax asset balances 

the increase in the effective tax rate for 2014 reflects changes in our geographic mix of earnings and the impact of a discrete tax charge of 10 million resulting from the impact of a change in apportionment factors on state tax rates applied to items in other comprehensive income and a discrete tax charge of 08 million as a result of the finalization of estimates of foreign tax credits available with respect to a repatriation of cash from our subsidiaries in israel 

during 2013 we recorded a discrete tax charge of 35 million which related to the finalization of a beneficial agreement with local tax authorities in israel that clarified the future tax status of our entities in israel and settled a tax audit for the years 2009 through 2011 during 2013 we also recorded a discrete tax charge of 13 million resulting from the impact of the change in the enacted tax rate in the united kingdom on our previouslyrecorded deferred tax asset balances and a discrete tax benefit of 13 million related to the research and development tax credit for activities completed in 2012 in accordance with us gaap although the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 the taxpayer relief act reinstated the tax credit on a retroactive basis to january 1 2012 the credit was not taken into account for financial reporting purposes until 2013 

as of december 31 2015 we had 59 million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits all of which if recognized would favorably impact the effective income tax rate it is reasonably possible that due to the expiration of statutes and the closing of tax audits the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced by approximately 10 million during the next twelve months which would favorably impact our effective tax rate 

equity in net income of affiliated companies 

equity in net income of affiliated companies represents the contribution to earnings from our 25 ownership interest in daikyo and our 49 ownership interest in four companies in mexico equity in net income of affiliated companies was 58 million 53 million and 54 million for the years 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively equity in net income of affiliated companies increased by 05 million or 94 in 2015 as favorable operating results in mexico were partially offset by unfavorable operating results at daikyo equity in net income of affiliated companies decreased by 01 million or 19 in 2014 as an unfavorable foreign currency impact on daikyos results was partially offset by favorable operating results in mexico 

purchases from and royalty payments made to affiliates totaled 658 million in 2015 689 million in 2014 and 745 million in 2013 the majority of which related to a distributorship agreement with daikyo that allows us to purchase and resell daikyo products sales to affiliates were 53 million 51 million and 59 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

net income 

net income in 2015 was 956 million or 130 per diluted share compared to 1271 million or 175 per diluted share in 2014 our 2015 results included the impact of a pension settlement charge of 320 million net of 184 million in tax a charge for executive retirement and related costs of 69 million net of 40 million in tax and a discrete tax charge of 08 million 

net income in 2014 was 1271 million or 175 per diluted share compared to 1123 million or 157 per diluted share in 2013 our 2014 results included the impact of a charge for license costs associated with acquired inprocess research of 08 million net of 04 million in tax and discrete tax charges of 18 million 

net income in 2013 was 1123 million or 157 per diluted share compared to 807 million or 115 per diluted share in 2012 our 2013 results included the impact of a loss on extinguishment of debt of 02 million and net discrete tax charges of 36 million 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources

the following table presents cash flow data for the years ended december 31  



net cash provided by operating activities 

2015 compared to 2014 

net cash provided by operating activities increased by 295 million in 2015 due to increased earnings before noncash charges and lower working capital requirements 

2014 compared to 2013   

net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 376 million in 2014 due to a 272 million increase in pension plan contributions and our receipt of a nonrefundable customer payment of 200 million in june 2013 in return for the exclusive use of smartdose within a specific therapeutic area 

net cash used in investing activities   

2015 compared to 2014 

net cash used in investing activities increased by 255 million in 2015 due to an increase in capital spending to 1316 million and sales and maturities of our remaining shortterm investments in 2014 the capital spending for 2015 consisted of spending for new products expansion activity and emerging markets including projects in the us europe and asia 

in october 2014 we announced plans to expand our global manufacturing operations to include a new facility in waterford ireland which will produce packaging components for insulin injector cartridges and other highvalue packaging components construction began in july 2015 

2014 compared to 2013   

net cash used in investing activities decreased by 459 million in 2014 due to a 400 million decrease in capital spending to 1119 million mainly as the construction of our corporate office and research building was completed in february 2013 the majority of the capital spending for 2014 related to new products expansion activity and emerging markets including projects in the us europe china and india 

net cash used in financing activities 

2015 compared to 2014

liquidity and capital resources 

the table below presents selected liquidity and capital measures as of 



cash and cash equivalents include all instruments that have maturities of ninety days or less when purchased working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents and total invested capital is defined as the sum of net debt and total equity net debt and total invested capital are nonus gaap financial measures that should not be used as a substitute for the comparable us gaap financial measures the nonus gaap financial measures are incorporated into our discussion and analysis as management believes that this information provides users a valuable insight into our overall performance and financial position working capital total debt and net debttototal invested capital amounts and percentages reflect our adoption of the guidance issued by the fasb in 2015 regarding the classification of debt issuance costs 

cash and cash equivalents –  our cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2015  consisted of cash held in depository accounts with banks around the world and cash invested in highquality shortterm investments the cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2015  included 1412 million of cash held by subsidiaries within the us and 1334 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the us deferred income taxes have not been provided for any funds held by the subsidiaries outside of the us as such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the us 

working capital   working capital at december 31 2015  decreased by 472 million or 116 as compared to december 31 2014 including a decrease of 227 million due to foreign currency translation excluding the impact of currency exchange rates cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and inventories increased by 414 million 141 million and 114 million respectively and total current liabilities increased by 864 million accounts receivable and inventory turnover measurements remained consistent between december 31 2014  and december 31 2015  the increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the reclassification of our series b notes from longterm debt to current liabilities between those period ends and an increase in accounts payable partially offset by the maturity of our series b floating rate notes on july 28 2015 

debt and credit facilities   the 373 million decrease in total debt at december 31 2015  as compared to december 31 2014  resulted from net repayments of 274 million and foreign currency rate fluctuations of 101 million partially offset by a reduction of 02 million in unamortized debt issuance costs 

on october 15 2015 we entered into the new credit agreement that replaced our prior 3000 million revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in april 2017 the new credit agreement which expires in october 2020 contains a 3000 million credit facility which may be increased from time to time by up to 1000 million in the aggregate subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and upon approval by the banks up to 300 million of the credit facility is available for swingline loans and up to 300 million is available for the issuance of standby letters of credit borrowings under the new credit agreement bear interest at either the base rate or at the applicable london interbank offered rate libor rate plus a tiered margin based on the ratio of our total debt to modified earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda ranging from 0 to 75 basis points for base rate loans and 100 to 175 basis points for libor rate loans at december 31 2015 we had 271 million in outstanding borrowings under the new credit agreement of which 42 million was denominated in yen and 229 million was denominated in euro the total amount outstanding at december 31 2015 was classified as longterm these borrowings together with outstanding letters of credit of 30 million resulted in a borrowing capacity available under the new credit agreement of 2699 million at december 31 2015 we do not expect any significant limitations on our ability to access this source of funds 

pursuant to the financial covenants in our debt agreements we are required to maintain established interest coverage ratios and to not exceed established leverage ratios in addition the agreements contain other customary covenants none of which we consider restrictive to our operations at december 31 2015 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements throughout 2016 

we believe that cash on hand and cash generated from operations together with availability under our multicurrency revolving credit facility will be adequate to address our foreseeable liquidity needs based on our current expectations of our business operations capital expenditures and scheduled payments of debt obligations 

commitments and contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments at december 31 2015  these obligations are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity 



 

 

 

 

reserves for uncertain tax positions   the table above does not include 59 million  of total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2015  due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for amounts which may be paid 

letters of credit   we have letters of credit totaling 30 million  supporting the reimbursement of workers compensation and other claims paid on our behalf by insurance carriers our accrual for insurance obligations was 82 million  at december 31 2015  of which 41 million  is in excess of our deductible and therefore is reimbursable by the insurance company 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2015  we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases unconditional purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business and outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

managements discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with us gaap the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions some of which are subjective and complex that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our results of operations and financial position 

revenue recognition  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists title and risk of loss have transferred the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured generally sales are recognized upon shipment or upon delivery to our customers site based upon shipping terms or legal requirements some customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes we record rebate costs when sales occur based on our assessment of the likelihood that the required volumes will be attained we also maintain an allowance for product returns as we believe that we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of returns based on our substantial historical experience 

impairment of longlived assets longlived assets including property plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable an asset is considered impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future expected undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset once an asset is considered impaired an impairment loss is recorded within other income expense for the difference between the assets carrying value and its fair value for assets held and used in the business management determines fair value using estimated future cash flows to be derived from the asset discounted to a net present value using an appropriate discount rate for assets held for sale or for investment purposes management determines fair value by estimating the proceeds to be received upon sale of the asset less disposition costs 

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually following the completion of our annual budget and longrange planning process or whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is the same as or one level below our operating segments recent accounting guidance allows entities to first assess qualitative factors including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors and overall financial performance to determine whether it is necessary to perform the first step of the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test we considered this guidance when performing our annual impairment testing but elected to continue utilizing the twostep quantitative impairment 

test the first step in the twostep test is to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill if the carrying amount exceeds fair value the second step must be performed the second step requires the comparison of the carrying amount of the goodwill to its implied fair value which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired as of the testing date any excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the implied fair value would represent an impairment loss considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test such as future sales future cash flows and longterm growth rates are consistent with internal projections and operating plans amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test are also largely dependent on the continued sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products as well as our timeliness and success in newproduct innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems changes in the estimate of fair value including the estimate of future cash flows could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position no impairment in the carrying value of our reporting units was evident as a result of our annual review of goodwill with the exception of our delivery systems americas and delivery systems europe reporting units each of which had a fair value in excess of its carrying value of approximately 20 and each of which is largely dependent on the continued and anticipated demand for certain of its contract manufacturing and proprietary products each of our reporting units whose assets included goodwill had a fair value in excess of its respective carrying value of at least 150 at december 31 2015  the goodwill associated with the delivery systems americas and europe reporting units equaled 397 million or 380 of our total goodwill 

certain trademarks have been determined to have indefinite lives and therefore are not subject to amortization similar to the impairment testing for goodwill there is an option to first assess qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test we considered this option when performing our impairment testing but elected to continue utilizing a quantitative test comparing the fair value and carrying value of the asset any excess carrying value would represent an impairment loss fair values are determined using discounted cash flow analyses 

intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 

employee benefits  we maintain funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans in the us and a number of other countries that cover employees who meet eligibility requirements in addition we sponsor postretirement benefit plans which provide healthcare benefits for eligible employees who retire or become disabled the measurement of annual cost and obligations under these defined benefit postretirement plans is subject to a number of assumptions which are specific for each of our us and foreign plans the assumptions which are reviewed at least annually are relevant to both the plan assets where applicable and the obligation for benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees two of the most critical assumptions in determining pension and retiree medical plan expense are the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement age rates of compensation increases mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience for our funded plans we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our plan assets as well as historical and expected rates of return in estimating the longterm rate of return on plan assets under us gaap differences between actual and expected results are generally accumulated in other comprehensive income loss as actuarial gains or losses and subsequently amortized into earnings over future periods 

changes in key assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position we estimate that every 25 basis point reduction in our longterm rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by 06 million and every 25 basis point reduction in our discount rate would increase pension expense by 06 million a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations our net pension underfunded balance at december 31 2015  was 574 million compared to 762 million at december 31 2014  our underfunded balance for other postretirement benefits was 102 million at december 31 2015  compared to 101 million at december 31 2014  

income taxes  we estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation in addition deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established to recognize differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities we maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized the recoverability of tax assets is subject to our estimates of future profitability generally at the respective subsidiary company and country level changes in tax legislation business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined 

  

when accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements we apply a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 

contingent consideration 

the fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to smartdose smartdose contingent consideration was initially determined using a probabilityweighted income approach and is revalued at each reporting date or more frequently if circumstances dictate changes in the fair value of this obligation are recorded as income or expense within other expense income in our consolidated statements of income the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration are the sales projections the probability of success factors and the discount rate significant increases or decreases in any of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement as development and commercialization of smartdose progresses we may need to update the sales projections the probability of success factors and the discount rate used this could result in a material increase or decrease to the contingent consideration liability 

see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 2 new accounting standards  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on accounting and reporting standards considered in the preparation and presentation of our financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risk factors such as fluctuating interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and increasing commodity prices these risk factors can impact our results of operations cash flows and financial position to manage these risks we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps call options and forward exchange contracts for periods consistent with and for notional amounts equal to or less than the underlying exposures in accordance with company policy derivative financial instruments are not used for speculation or trading purposes 

foreign currency exchange risk 

sales outside of the us accounted for 520  of consolidated net sales in 2015  virtually all of these sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into usd for consolidated reporting purposes although the majority of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary they may also hold assets or liabilities denominated in other currencies these items may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains and losses as a result our results of operations and financial position are exposed to changing currency exchange rates we periodically use forward contracts to hedge certain transactions or to neutralize monthend balance sheet exposures on crosscurrency intercompany loans 

we have designated our €611 million euro note b and our €210 million eurodenominated borrowings under our revolving credit facility as a hedge of our net investment in certain european subsidiaries we also have ¥5000 million in yendenominated borrowings under our revolving credit facility which has been designated as a hedge of our net investment in daikyo at december 31 2015  a net cumulative foreign currency translation gain on these hedges of 58 million net of tax of 34 million was recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss 

interest rate risk    

as a result of our normal borrowing activities we have longterm debt with both fixed and variable interest rates longterm debt consists of senior notes revolving credit facilities and capital lease obligations our exposures to fluctuations in interest rates are managed to the extent considered necessary by entering into interest rate swap agreements 

the following table summarizes our interest rate risksensitive instruments 



1 as of december 31 2015  we have a forwardstart interest rate swap outstanding designed to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the applicable interest rate of our 371 million  fiveyear term loan at december 31 2015  this agreement had a fair value of 20 million  unfavorable to the company which was recorded as a noncurrent liability refer to note 9 derivative financial instruments  for additional information on this interest rate hedge 

commodity price risk 

many of our packaging systems products are made from synthetic elastomers which are derived from the petroleum refining process we purchase the majority of our elastomers via longterm supply contracts some of which contain clauses that provide for surcharges related to fluctuations in crude oil prices in recent years increases in raw material costs have had an adverse impact on us we expect the volatility in raw material prices to continue we will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects on gross profit 

in november 2014 we purchased a series of call options for a total of 134700 barrels of crude oil to mitigate our exposure to such oilbased surcharges and protect operating cash flows with regard to a portion of our forecasted elastomer purchases through december 2015 as of december 31 2015  there were no options outstanding

an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our ceo and cfo of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this form 10k based on this evaluation our ceo and cfo have concluded that as of december 31 2015  our disclosure controls and procedures are effective 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our ceo and cfo to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015  based on the framework established in “internal controlintegrated framework 2013” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2015  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within west have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015  has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein 

changes in internal controls 

during the fourth quarter ended december 31 2015  there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

business segments 

our business operations are organized into two reportable segments which are aligned with the underlying markets and customers they serve our reportable segments are the pharmaceutical packaging systems segment “packaging systems” and the pharmaceutical delivery systems segment “delivery systems” 

packaging systems segment 

our packaging systems segment develops manufactures and sells primary packaging components and systems for injectable drug delivery including stoppers and seals for vials closures and other components used in syringe intravenous and blood collection systems and prefillable syringe components the growth strategy for packaging systems includes organic growth through market segmentation newproduct innovation strategic acquisitions and geographic expansion we have manufacturing facilities in north and south america europe and asia pacific with affiliated companies in mexico and japan see item 2 properties    for additional information on our manufacturing and other sites 

packaging systems consists of three operating segments  americas europe and asia pacific  which are aggregated for reporting purposes 

packaging systems products generally consist of elastomeric components offered in a variety of standard and customerspecific configurations and formulations which are available with advanced barrier films and coatings to enhance their performance west flurotec barrier film is applied to reduce the risk of product loss by contamination and protect the shelf life of packaged drugs we also apply a teflon coating to the surface of stoppers and plungers to improve compatibility between the closure and the drug b2coating is a coating applied to the surface of stoppers and plungers using a process that eliminates the need for conventional silicone application it helps manufacturers reduce product rejections due to trace levels of silicone molecules found in noncoated packaged drug compounds flurotec and b2coating technologies are licensed from daikyo 

in addition our westar® rs and westar ru postmanufacturing processes are documented and fully validated procedures for washing and siliconizing stoppers and syringe components to remove biological materials and endotoxins the westar rs process prepares components for introduction into the customers sterilizer and the westar ru process provides sterilized components these processes increase the overall efficiency of injectable drug production by outsourcing component processing thereby eliminating steps otherwise required in each of our customers manufacturing processes and help to assure compliance with the latest regulatory requirements for component preparation we also offer envision™ components that are inspected using automated vision inspection systems ensuring that components plungers and stoppers meet enhanced quality specifications for visible and subvisible particulate and contamination 

our novapure ®  components which include serum and lyophilization stoppers and syringe plungers incorporate quality by design principles and are manufactured utilizing advanced process technologies the closures provide the highest levels of quality to the market helping to ensure the safety efficacy and purity of injectable drug products 

our tamperevident flipoff® seals are sold in a wide range of sizes and colors to meet customers needs for product identification and differentiation the seals can be provided using proprietary printing for cautionary statements and embossing technology that can serve as a counterfeiting deterrence 

as an adjunct to our packaging systems products we offer contract analytical laboratory services for testing and evaluating primary drugpackaging components and their compatibility with the contained drug formulation west analytical services provides us and our customers with indepth knowledge and analysis of the interaction and compatibility of drug products with elastomer glass and plastic packaging components our analytical laboratories also provide specialized testing for complete drug delivery systems 

see note 17 segment information  for net sales and asset information for packaging systems 

delivery systems segment 

our delivery systems segment develops manufactures and sells safety and administration systems multicomponent systems for drug administration and a variety of custom contractmanufacturing solutions targeted to the healthcare and consumerproducts industries delivery systems has expertise in product design and development including inhouse mold design and construction an engineering center for developmental and prototype tooling process design and validation and highspeed automated assemblies in addition delivery systems is responsible for the continued development and commercialization of our line of proprietary healthcare administrative and advanced injection systems including daikyo cz smartdose® and other systems delivery systems has manufacturing operations in north america and europe see item 2 properties  for additional information on our manufacturing and other sites 

delivery systems offers a variety of products and services which are described below 

we offer customer contractmanufacturing and assembly solutions which use such technologies as multicomponent molding inmold labeling ultrasonic welding and clean room molding and device assembly used to manufacture customerowned components and devices used in surgical diagnostic ophthalmic other drug delivery systems personal care and consumer products 

our administration systems include sterile devices for the administration of drug products including patented products such as the mixject ®  transfer device the mix2vial ®  needleless reconstitution system and vial adapters 

examples of our safety systems that are designed to prevent needle sticks are éris tm and novaguard ® sa for prefilled syringes and novaguard lp for luer lock syringes 

the daikyo cz 1ml long insert needle syringe system is the markets first syringe system without silicone oil lubrication applied to the barrel or plunger that incorporates an insertmolded needle to avoid the need for adhesive the luer lock version of the daikyo cz syringe system was introduced previously along with several sizes of sterile vials additional sizes of vials continue to be introduced cz technology is licensed from daikyo 

our smartdose electronic patch injector system is under evaluation by several biopharmaceutical companies this system is designed for controlled subcutaneous delivery of high volume and high viscosity drugs using prefilled daikyo cz cartridges the system is fully programmable has a single pushbutton operation and a hidden needle for safety 

the confidose® autoinjector and selfdose tm  selfinjection systems enhance patient compliance and safety the needle remains automatically shielded at all times these systems eliminate preparation steps and simplify the injection of drugs providing patients with a sterile singleuse disposable system that can be readily used at home 

see note 17 segment information  for net sales and asset information for delivery systems 

international 

we have significant operations outside of the united states us which are managed through the same business segments as our us operations – packaging systems and delivery systems sales outside of the us accounted for 54 of consolidated net sales in 2014 for a geographic breakdown of sales see note 17 segment information  

although the general business processes are similar to the domestic business international operations are exposed to additional risks these risks include currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar multiple tax jurisdictions and particularly in south america and israel political and social issues that could destabilize local markets and affect the demand for our products 

see further discussion of our international operations the risks associated with our international operations and our attempt to minimize some of these risks in part i item 1a risk factors  part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resources part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  note 1   under the captions financial instruments  and foreign currency translation and note 9 derivative financial instruments  

raw materials 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers aluminum and plastic elastomers include both natural and synthetic materials we currently have access to adequate supplies of these raw materials to meet our production needs through agreements with suppliers 

we employ a supplychain management strategy in our business segments which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply due to regulatory control over our production processes and the cost and time involved in qualifying suppliers we rely on singlesource suppliers for many critical raw materials we purchase certain of our raw materials in the open market this strategy increases the risk that our supply chain may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production problem these risks are managed where possible by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites rigorous quality control systems surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in case of an interruption in production 

intellectual property rights 

intellectual property including patents trade secrets and knowhow is important to our business we own or license intellectual property rights including issued patents and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries that relate to various aspects of our products in particular key valueadded and proprietary products and processes are licensed from daikyo our intellectual property rights have been useful in establishing our market share and in the growth of our business and are expected to continue to be of value in the future although important in the aggregate we do not consider our business to be materially dependent on any individual patent or license 

seasonality 

although our packaging systems business is not inherently seasonal sales and operating profit in the second half of the year are typically lower than the first half primarily due to scheduled plant shutdowns in conjunction with our customers production schedules and the yearend impact of holidays on production 

our delivery systems business is not inherently seasonal 

working capital 

we are required to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet customer requirements in addition some of our supply agreements require us to purchase inventory in bulk orders which increases inventory levels but decreases the risk of supply interruption levels of inventory are also influenced by the seasonal patterns addressed above for a more detailed discussion of working capital please see the discussion in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resource s 

marketing 

our packaging systems customers include practically every major branded pharmaceutical generic and biopharmaceutical company in the world packaging systems components and other products are sold to major pharmaceutical biotechnology and hospital supplymedical device companies which incorporate them into their products for distribution to the ultimate enduser 

our delivery systems segment sells to many of the worlds largest pharmaceutical biopharmaceutical and medical device companies and to large customers within the personal care and foodandbeverage industries delivery systems components generally are incorporated into our customers manufacturing lines for further processing or assembly 

our products and services are distributed primarily through our own sales force and distribution network with limited use of contract sales agents and regional distributors 

our ten largest customers accounted for 402 of our consolidated net sales in 2014 but none of these customers individually accounted for more than 10 of net sales see note 17 segment information  for information on sales by significant product group 

order backlog 

at december 31 2014 and 2013 the order backlog for packaging systems excluding consigned inventory was 3397 million and 3156 million respectively the increase in the order backlog for packaging systems primarily reflects a return to normal levels partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency impact in 2013 several customers completed strategic stockbuilding which resulted in a reduced order backlog at december 31 2013 order backlog includes firm orders placed by customers for manufacture over a period of time according to their schedule or upon confirmation by the customer we also have contractual arrangements with a number of our customers products covered by these contracts are included in our backlog only as orders are received order backlog may be positively or negatively impacted by several factors including customer ordering patterns and the necessary leadtime to deliver customer orders order backlog is one of many measures we use to understand future demand and should not be considered in isolation to predict future sales growth the entire order backlog for packaging systems at december 31 2014 is expected to be filled during 2015 

the majority of delivery systems manufacturing activity is governed by contractual volume expectations with terms between one and three years subject to periodic revisions based on customer requirements 

competition 

we compete with several companies across our packaging systems product lines however we believe that we supply a major portion of the us market for pharmaceutical elastomer and metal packaging components and also have a significant share of the european market for these components because of the special nature of our pharmaceutical packaging components and our longstanding participation in the market competition is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive costcontrol programs across their operations 

we differentiate ourselves from our competition as a fullservice valueadded global supplier that can provide presale formula and engineering development analytical services regulatory expertise and postmanufacturing technologies as well as aftersale technical support customers also appreciate the global scope of wests manufacturing capability and our ability to produce many products at multiple sites 

our delivery systems business competes in very competitive markets for both healthcare and consumer products the markets we serve are also served by many competitors and therefore our market shares are generally less than 5 of the total global markets the competition varies from smaller regional companies to large global molders that command significant market shares there are extreme cost pressures and many of our customers look offshore to reduce cost we differentiate ourselves by leveraging our global capability and by employing new technologies such as highspeed automated assembly insertmolding multishot molding and expertise with multiplepiece closure systems 

because of the more demanding regulatory requirements in the medical device component area there are a smaller number of competitors mostly largescale companies we compete for this market on the basis of our reputation for quality and reliability in engineering and project management diverse contract manufacturing capabilities and knowledge of and experience in complying with us food and drug administration fda requirements with our range of proprietary technologies we compete with new and established companies in the area of drug delivery devices including suppliers of prefillable syringes autoinjectors safety needles and other proprietary systems 

research and development activities 

we maintain our own researchscale production facilities and laboratories for developing new products and offer contract engineering design and development services to assist customers with new product development our quality control regulatory and laboratory testing capabilities are used to ensure compliance with applicable manufacturing and regulatory standards for primary and secondary pharmaceutical packaging components the engineering departments are responsible for product and tooling design and testing and for the design and construction of processing equipment we continue to seek new innovative opportunities for acquisition licensing partnering or development within injectable packaging and delivery systems most of which will be manufactured and marketed by our delivery systems segment research and development spending will continue to increase as we pursue innovative strategic platforms in prefillable syringe injectable container advanced injection and safety and administration systems 

commercial development of our new products and services for medical and pharmaceutical applications commonly requires several years new products that we develop may require separate approval as medical devices and products that are intended to be used in the packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical products will be subject to both customer acceptance of our products and regulatory approval of the customers products following our development period 

we spent 163 million in 2014 151 million in 2013 and 127 million in 2012 on research and development for packaging systems delivery systems incurred research and development costs of 210 million 228 million and 205 million in the years 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2014 and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes in 2015 

employees 

as of december 31 2014 we employed approximately 7000 people in our operations throughout the world 




 item 1a risk factors 

the statements in this section describe major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this form 10k contains some forwardlooking statements that are based on managements beliefs and assumptions current expectations estimates and forecasts we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forwardlooking statements such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts we have attempted wherever possible to identify forwardlooking statements by using words such as “estimate” “expect” “intend” “believe” “plan” “anticipate” and other words and terms of similar meaning in particular these include statements relating to future actions business plans and prospects new products future performance or results of current or anticipated products sales efforts expenses interest rates foreignexchange rates economic effects the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results 

many of the factors that will determine our future results are beyond our ability to control or predict achievement of future results is subject to known or unknown risks or uncertainties and therefore actual results could differ materially from past results and those expressed or implied in any forwardlooking statement you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements 

unless required by applicable securities law we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise we also refer you to further disclosures we make on related subjects in our quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k to the sec 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 

the current uncertainty in the global economy including the continuing effects of recession or slow economic growth in the us and europe may negatively affect our operating results examples of the effects of these continuing global economic challenges include our suppliers and our customers inability to access the credit markets at commercially reasonable rates reduction in sales due to customers decreasing their inventories in the nearterm or longterm or due to liquidity difficulties reduction in sales due to shortages of materials we purchase from our suppliers reduction in research and development efforts and expenditures by our customers our inability to hedge our currency and raw material risks sufficiently or at commercially reasonable prices insolvency of suppliers or customers inflationary pressures on our supplies or our products and increased expenses due to growing taxation of corporate profits or revenues our operating results in one or more geographic regions may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region if economic and market conditions in the us or europe weaken further we may experience material adverse impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our sales and profitability are largely dependent on the sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products if the products developed by our customers in the future use another delivery system our sales and profitability could suffer 

our business depends to a substantial extent on customers continued sales and development of products that are delivered by injection if our customers fail to continue to sell develop and deploy new injectable products or we are unable to develop new products that assist in the delivery of drugs by alternative methods our sales and profitability may suffer 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

our business is subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations sales outside of the us accounted for 54 of our consolidated net sales in 2014 and we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales in the future in addition many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the us further we intend to continue our expansion into emerging andor fastergrowing markets outside of the us in the future virtually all of our international sales assets and related operating costs and expenses are earned valued or incurred in the currency of the local country primarily the euro the danish krone and the singapore dollar in addition we are exposed to japanese yen yen as we maintain a 25 ownership interest in and we purchase finished goods and other materials from daikyo our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars and therefore we must translate the reported values of our foreign assets liabilities revenues and expenses into us dollars which can result in significant fluctuations in 

the amount of those assets liabilities revenues or expenses the exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar compared to these foreign currencies may negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

in addition to translation risks we incur currency transaction risk when we or one of our subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction in a currency other than that entitys local currency in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in certain exchange rates we have entered and expect to continue to enter into hedging arrangements including the use of financial derivatives there can be no certainty that we will be able to enter into or maintain hedges of these currency risks or that our hedges will be effective which could have a significant effect on our financial condition and operating results 

if we are unable to provide comparative value advantages timely fulfillment of customer orders or resist pricing pressure we will have to reduce our prices which may reduce our profit margins 

we compete with several companies across our major product lines because of the special nature of these products competition is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive costcontrol programs across their operations competitors often compete on the basis of price we differentiate ourselves from our competition as a fullservice valueadded global supplier that is able to provide presale compatibility studies and other services and sophisticated postsale technical support on a global basis however we face continued pricing pressure from our customers and competitors if we are unable to resist or to offset the effects of continued pricing pressure through our valueadded services improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures or if we have to reduce our prices our sales and profitability may suffer 

consolidation in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries have experienced a significant amount of consolidation as a result of this consolidation competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased in addition group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has placed pricing pressure on suppliers further consolidation within the industries we serve could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products 

we are subject to regulation by governments around the world and if these regulations are not complied with existing and future operations may be curtailed and we could be subject to liability 

the design development manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our products and our customers products that incorporate our products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the us europe and other countries including the fda and the european medicines agency complying with governmental regulation can be costly and can result in required modification or withdrawal of existing products and a substantial delay in the introduction of new products failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or failure to obtain regulatory approval for a new product could result in expenses and actions that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

products incorporating our technologies are subject to regulations and extensive approval or clearance processes which make the timing and success of newproduct commercialization difficult to predict 

the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is expensive and timeconsuming historically most medical devices incorporating our technologies have been subject to the fdas 510k marketing approval process which typically lasts from six to nine months supplemental or full premarket approval reviews require a significantly longer period delaying commercialization pharmaceutical products incorporating our technologies are subject to the fdas new drug application process which typically takes a number of years to complete   additionally biotechnology products incorporating our technologies are subject to the fdas biologics license application process which also typically takes a number of years to complete outside of the us sales of medical devices and pharmaceutical or biotechnology products are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary from country to country the time required to obtain approval for sale internationally may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 

changes in the regulation of drug products and devices may increase competitive pressure and adversely affect our business 

an effect of the governmental regulation of our customers drug products devices and manufacturing processes is that compliance with regulations makes it costly and timeconsuming for customers to substitute or replace components and devices produced by one supplier with those from another the regulation of our customers products that incorporate our components and devices has increased over time if the applicable regulations were to be modified in a way that reduced the cost and time involved for customers to substitute one suppliers components or devices for those made by another it is likely that the competitive pressure would increase and adversely affect our sales and profitability 

if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights we may harm our ability to compete 

our patents trademarks and other intellectual property are important to our business we rely on patent trademark copyright trade secret and other intellectual property laws as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary information technologies and processes we also have obligations with respect to the nonuse and nondisclosure of third party intellectual property we may need to engage in litigation or similar activities to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others any such litigation could require us to expend significant resources and divert the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel from our business operations we cannot assure you that the steps we will take to prevent misappropriation infringement or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of others will be successful in addition effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for some of our intellectual property in some countries failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business and results of operations in addition if relevant and effective patent protection is not available we may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar or duplicative to ours 

disruption in our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make and sell products and have a negative impact on our reputation performance or financial condition 

we have manufacturing sites all over the world in addition in some instances the manufacturing of certain product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants the functioning of our manufacturing and distribution assets and systems could be disrupted for reasons either within or beyond our control including extreme weather or longerterm climatic changes natural disasters pandemic war accidental damage disruption to the supply of material or services product quality and safety issues systems failure workforce actions or environmental contamination there is a risk that incident management systems in place may prove inadequate and that any disruption may materially adversely affect our ability to make and sell products and therefore materially adversely affect our reputation performance or financial condition 

the medical technology industry is very competitive and customer demands andor new products in the marketplace could cause a reduction in demand 

the medical technology industry is subject to rapid technological changes and we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold we face this competition from a wide range of companies these include large medical device companies some of which have greater financial and marketing resources than we do we also face competition from firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets in some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for diseases that may be delivered without a medical device the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology may render some of our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive in addition failure to meet increased customer quality expectations could cause a reduction in demand 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that vary by country and which could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

we conduct business in most of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world our international operations and our ability to implement our overall business strategy including our plan to continue expanding into emerging andor fastergrowing markets outside the us are subject to risks and uncertainties that can vary by country and include transportation delays and interruptions political and economic instability and disruptions imposition of duties and tariffs import and export controls the risks of divergent business expectations or cultural incompatibility inherent in establishing and maintaining operations in foreign countries difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations labor strikes andor disputes and potentially adverse tax consequences limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies with third parties or our joint venture partners outside of the us could also create exposure in addition we may not be able to operate in compliance with foreign laws and regulations or comply with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject in the event that these laws or regulations change any of these events could have an adverse effect on our international operations in the future by reducing the demand for our products decreasing the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

disruptions in the supply of key raw materials could adversely impact our operations 

we generally purchase our raw materials and supplies required for the production of our products in the open market for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability or cost effectiveness many components and raw materials are available andor purchased only from a single supplier due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for these components or materials or do so without excessive cost as a result a reduction or interruption in manufacturing or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

raw material and energy prices have a significant impact on our profitability if raw material andor energy prices increase and we cannot pass those price increases on to our customers our profitability and financial condition may suffer 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers which include synthetic and natural material aluminum and plastic in addition our manufacturing facilities consume a wide variety of energy products to fuel heat and cool our operations supply and demand factors which are beyond our control generally affect the price of our raw materials and utility costs if we are unable to pass along increased raw material prices and energy costs to our customers our profitability and thus our financial condition may be adversely affected the prices of many of these raw materials and utilities are cyclical and volatile for example the prices of certain commodities particularly petroleumbased raw materials have in the recent past exhibited rapid changes affecting the cost of synthetic elastomers and plastic while we generally attempt to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of sales price increases historically there has been a time delay between raw material andor energy price increases and our ability to increase the prices of our products in some circumstances we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pressure and other factors 

if we are not timely or successful in newproduct innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems our future revenues and operating income could be adversely affected 

our growth partly depends on newproduct innovation and the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications such as the daikyo cz readytouse prefilled syringe system product development and commercialization is inherently uncertain and is subject to a number of factors outside of our control including any necessary regulatory approvals and commercial acceptance for the products the ultimate timing and successful commercialization of new products and systems requires substantial evaluations of the functional operational clinical and economic viability of the companys products in addition the timely and adequate availability of filling capacity is essential to both conducting definitive stability trials and the timing of first commercialization of customers products in cz prefilled syringes delays interruptions or failures in developing and commercializing newproduct innovations or proprietary multicomponent systems could adversely affect future revenues and operating income in addition adverse conditions may also result in future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we may not succeed in finding and completing acquisition or other strategic transactions if any which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we have historically engaged in acquisition activity and we may in the future engage in acquisitions or other strategic transactions such as joint ventures or investments in other entities we may be unable to identify suitable targets opportunistic or otherwise for acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future if we identify a suitable candidate our ability to successfully implement the strategic transaction would depend on a variety of factors including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and to comply with the restrictions contained in our debt agreements strategic transactions involve risks including those associated with integrating the operations or maintaining the operations as separate as applicable financial reporting disparate technologies and personnel of acquired companies joint ventures or related companies managing geographically dispersed operations or other strategic investments the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience unknown risks and the potential loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies joint ventures or companies in which we may make strategic investments we may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire or strategically develop in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits relating to any such strategic transactions strategic transactions may be expensive time consuming and may strain our resources strategic transactions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of among other things the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and amortization expenses of other intangible assets in addition strategic transactions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities 

product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 

the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects unanticipated use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market a recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals 

our operations must comply with environmental statutes and regulations and any failure to comply could result in extensive costs which would harm our business 

the manufacture of some of our products involves the use transportation storage and disposal of hazardous or toxic materials and is subject to various environmental protection and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate this has exposed us in the past and could expose us in the future to risks of accidental contamination and events of noncompliance with environmental laws any such occurrences could result in regulatory enforcement or personal injury and property damage claims or could lead to a shutdown of some of our operations which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations we currently incur costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations and these costs may become more significant 

a loss of key personnel or highly skilled employees could disrupt our operations 

our executive officers are critical to the management and direction of our businesses our future success depends in large part on our ability to retain these officers and other key employees including people in technical marketing sales and research positions competition for experienced employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees our business could be adversely affected although we believe that we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise our inability to do so on a timely basis could disrupt the operations of the unit affected or our overall operations in addition because of the complex nature of many of our products and programs we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled engineering staff and workforce our operations could be disrupted by a shortage of available skilled employees 

the uncertain effects of potential climate change legislation could lead to significantly increased costs 

if legislation or regulations are enacted or promulgated in the us europe or asia or any other jurisdictions in which we do business that limit or reduce allowable greenhouse gas emissions and other emissions such restrictions could have a significant effect on our operating and financial decisions including those involving capital expenditures to reduce emissions and our results of operations our manufacturing operations may not be able to operate as planned if we are not able to comply with new legal and regulatory legislation around climate change or it may become too costly to operate in a profitable manner additionally suppliers added expenses could be passed on to us in the form of higher prices and we may not be able to pass on such expenses to our customers through price increases 

federal healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations 

the patient protection and affordable care act the “ppaca” was enacted in march 2010 the ppaca reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures the ppaca also imposes significant new taxes on medical device makers in the form of an excise tax on all us medical device sales as defined under the regulations these factors in turn could result in reduced demand for our products and increased downward pricing pressure it is also possible that the ppaca will result in lower reimbursements for our customers products while the ppaca is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the us the impact of any overall increase in access to healthcare on sales of wests products is uncertain at this time our sales depend in part on the extent to which pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities private insurers and other thirdparty payers for the costs of our products the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers which can vary among public and private sources may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these products in a particular jurisdiction legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the us as part of the ppaca or abroad for example those under consideration in france germany italy and the united kingdom could significantly reduce reimbursement for our customers products which could in turn reduce the demand for our products 

the full effects of the ppaca cannot be known until all of the provisions are implemented and the centers for medicare  medicaid services and other federal and state agencies issue applicable regulations or guidance moreover in the coming years additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our products we will continue to evaluate the ppaca as amended the implementation of regulations or guidance related to various provisions of the ppaca by federal agencies as well as trends and changes that may be encouraged by the legislation and that may potentially impact our business over time 

no assurance can be given that we will continue to pay or declare dividends 

we have historically paid dividends however there can be no assurance that we will pay or declare dividends in the future the actual declaration and payment of future dividends the amount of any such dividends and the establishment of record and payment dates if any are subject to determination by our board of directors each quarter after its review of our thencurrent strategy applicable debt covenants and financial performance and position among other things our declaration and payment of future dividends is subject to risks and uncertainties including deterioration of our financial performance or position inability to declare a dividend in compliance with applicable laws or debt covenants an increase in our cash needs or decrease in available cash and the business judgment of the board of directors that a declaration of a dividend is not in the companys best interests 

our results of operations and earnings may not meet guidance or expectations  

we provide public guidance on our expected results of operations for future periods this guidance is comprised of forwardlooking statements subject to risks and uncertainties including the risks and uncertainties described in this form 10k and in our other public filings and public statements and is based necessarily on assumptions we make at the time we provide such guidance our guidance may not always be accurate if in the future our results of operations for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or if we reduce our guidance for future periods the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 

we are exposed to credit risk on accounts receivable and certain prepayments made in the normal course of business this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

a substantial majority of our outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance in addition we have made prepayments associated with insurance premiums and other advances in the normal course of business while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on trade receivables and other current assets there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk and avoid losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

unauthorized access to our or our customers information and systems could negatively impact our business 

we may face certain security threats including threats to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data and systems we maintain an extensive network of technical security controls policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems in order to address these threats while these measures are designed to prevent detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems certain types of attacks could result in financial or information losses andor reputational harm if we cannot prevent the unauthorized access release andor corruption of our or our customers confidential classified or personally identifiable information our reputation could be damaged andor we could face financial losses 

if we fail to comply with our obligations under our distributorship or license agreements with daikyo or we are unable to renew these agreements on the same or substantially similar terms we could lose license rights that are important to our business 

key valueadded and proprietary products and processes are licensed from our affiliate daikyo including but not limited to daikyo cz flurotec and b2coating technologies our rights to these products and processes are licensed pursuant to agreements that expire in 2017 which we expect to renew prior to their expiration however if we are unsuccessful in renewing these agreements or if the agreements are terminated early because we fail to satisfy our obligations our business could be adversely impacted

nongaap financial measures 

for the purpose of aiding the comparison of our yearoveryear results we may refer to net sales and other financial results excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates the constantcurrency amounts are calculated by translating the current year’s functional currency results at the prioryear period’s exchange rate these remeasured results excluding effects from currency translation are not in conformity with us gaap and should not be used as a substitute for the comparable us gaap financial measures the nonus gaap financial measures are incorporated into our discussion and analysis as management uses them in evaluating our results of operations and believes that this information provides users a valuable insight into our results 

our operations 

we are a manufacturer of components and systems for the packaging and delivery of injectable drugs as well as delivery system components for the pharmaceutical healthcare and consumer products industries our products include stoppers and seals for vials prefillable syringe components and systems components for intravenous and blood collection systems safety and administration systems advanced injection systems and contract design and manufacturing services our customers include the leading global producers of pharmaceuticals biologics medical devices and personal care products we were incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania on july 27 1923 

our business operations are organized into two reportable segments which are aligned with the underlying markets and customers they serve our reportable segments are packaging systems and delivery systems packaging systems develops manufactures and sells primary packaging components and systems for injectable drug delivery including stoppers and seals for vials closures and other components used in syringe intravenous and blood collection systems and prefillable syringe components delivery systems develops manufactures and sells safety and administration systems multicomponent systems for drug administration and a variety of custom contractmanufacturing solutions targeted to the healthcare and consumerproducts industries in addition delivery systems is responsible for the continued development and commercialization of our line of proprietary multicomponent systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications we also maintain global partnerships to share technologies and market products with affiliates in japan and mexico 

as a result of our global manufacturing and distribution presence more than half of our revenues are generated outside of the us in currencies other than the us dollar including 44 in europe and 10 collectively in asia south america and israel fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates therefore can have a significant effect on our consolidated financial results generally our financial results are affected positively by a weaker us dollar and negatively by a stronger us dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business in terms of net sales the most significant foreign currencies are the euro the danish krone and the singapore dollar with eurodenominated sales representing the majority of sales transacted in foreign currencies in addition we are exposed to yen as we maintain a 25 ownership interest in and we purchase finished goods and other materials from daikyo during 2014 average exchange rates were unfavorable versus the exchange rates realized in 2013 resulting in lower reported net sales and operating profit of 55 million and 14 million respectively versus 2013 

2014 financial performance highlights 

 

we anticipate continued revenue and margin improvement on a longterm basis driven by customers increasing demand for higher product quality which results in higher revenues and margin per unit sold in packaging systems and an increasing percentage of total sales from higher margin proprietary products in delivery systems we continue to believe that actions taken in recent years to increase capacity for certain products reduce costs through restructuring and lean savings efforts and expand into emerging markets will lead to improved profitability as global demand increases we plan to continue funding capital projects related to new products expansion activity advanced quality systems and investment in emerging markets for packaging systems and new proprietary products within delivery systems we believe that our strong operating results and financial position give us a platform for sustained growth and will enable us to take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business as they arise see part i item 1a risk factors  of this form 10k for further discussion regarding the risks associated with our operations 

in october 2014 donald e morel jr phd our chairman and chief executive officer announced his intention to retire at our annual meeting in may 2015 our board of directors has launched a comprehensive search for dr morel’s successor 

results of operations 

we evaluate the performance of our segments based upon among other things segment net sales and operating profit segment operating profit excludes general corporate costs which include executive and director compensation stockbased compensation adjustments to annual incentive plan expense for over or underattainment of targets certain pension and other retirement benefit costs and other corporate facilities and administrative expenses not allocated to the segments also excluded are items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations such items are referred to as other unallocated items and generally include restructuring and related charges certain asset impairments and other specificallyidentified income or expense items 

percentages in the following tables and throughout the results of operations  section may reflect rounding adjustments

during the year ended december 31 2012 we recognized a pretax loss on debt extinguishment of 116 million related to our repurchase of 1584 million of our convertible debentures which consisted of a 62 million premium over par value 44 million writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs and 10 million in transaction costs 

interest expense net 

the following table presents interest expense net by significant component 



2014 compared to 2013 

interest expense net decreased by 21 million or 139 in 2014 primarily due to 16 million in interest income following the settlement of a tax matter in brazil and lower interest expense resulting from less debt outstanding during 2014 

2013 compared to 2012 

interest expense net increased by 02 million or 13 in 2013 primarily due to a decrease in capitalized interest as less capital projects were in progress in 2013 as compared to 2012 interest expense was constant at 186 million for both 2013 and 2012 as the impact of the higher interest rate associated with the fiveyear team loan that we entered into in 2013 was offset by the impact of less debt outstanding during 2013 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes was 472 million 402 million and 327 million for the years 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively resulting in effective tax rates of 280 274 and 302 respectively 

the increase in the effective tax rate for 2014 reflects changes in our geographic mix of earnings and the impact of the discrete tax items discussed below 

during 2014 we recorded a discrete tax charge of 10 million resulting from the impact of a change in apportionment factors on state tax rates applied to items in other comprehensive income and a discrete tax charge of 08 million as a result of the finalization of estimates of foreign tax credits available with respect to a repatriation of cash from our subsidiaries in israel 

the decrease in the effective tax rate for 2013 reflects the nondeductibility of the purchase premium paid during 2012 related to the extinguishment of our convertible debentures and the impact of the discrete tax items discussed below 

during 2013 we recorded a discrete tax charge of 35 million which related to the finalization of a beneficial agreement with local tax authorities in israel that clarified the future tax status of our entities in israel and settled a tax audit for the years 2009 through 2011 during 2013 we also recorded a discrete tax charge of 13 million resulting from the impact of the change in the enacted tax rate in the united kingdom on our previouslyrecorded deferred tax asset balances and a discrete tax benefit of 13 million related to the research and development tax credit for activities completed in 2012 in accordance with us gaap although the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 the taxpayer relief act reinstated the tax credit on a retroactive basis to january 1 2012 the credit was not taken into account for financial reporting purposes until 2013 had the act been signed prior to january 2013 our effective tax rate for 2012 would have been reduced by approximately 10 

during 2012 as a result of the finalization of estimates of foreign tax credits available with respect to a dividend from one of our foreign subsidiaries we recorded a discrete tax charge of 10 million we also recorded a discrete tax charge of 08 million resulting from the impact of a change in the enacted tax rate in the united kingdom on our previouslyrecorded deferred tax balances and recorded a discrete tax charge of 03 million reduction of our deferred tax assets associated with the legal restructuring of the ownership of our puerto rico operations 

as of december 31 2014 we had 69 million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits of which 68 million if recognized would favorably impact the effective income tax rate it is reasonably possible that due to the expiration of statutes and the closing of tax audits the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced by approximately 03 million during the next twelve months which would favorably impact our effective tax rate 

equity in net income of affiliated companies 

equity in net income of affiliated companies represents the contribution to earnings from our 25 ownership interest in daikyo and our 49 ownership interest in four companies in mexico equity in net income of affiliated companies was 53 million 54 million and 48 million for the years 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively equity in net income of affiliated companies decreased by 01 million or 19 in 2014 as an unfavorable foreign currency impact on daikyos results was partially offset by favorable operating results in mexico equity in net income of affiliated companies increased by 06 million or 125 in 2013 primarily due to favorable operating results in mexico 

purchases from and royalty payments made to affiliates totaled 687 million in 2014 677 million in 2013 and 752 million in 2012 the majority of which related to a distributorship agreement with daikyo that allows us to purchase and resell daikyo products sales to affiliates were 51 million 59 million and 35 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

net income 

net income in 2014 was 1271 million or 175 per diluted share compared to 1123 million or 157 per diluted share in 2013 our 2014 results included the impact of a charge for license costs associated with acquired inprocess research of 08 million net of 04 million in tax and discrete tax charges of 18 million 

net income in 2013 was 1123 million or 157 per diluted share compared to 807 million or 115 per diluted share in 2012 our 2013 results included the impact of a loss on extinguishment of debt of 02 million and net discrete tax charges of 36 million 

net income in 2012 was 807 million or 115 per diluted share compared to 755 million or 108 per diluted share in 2011 our 2012 results included the impact of restructuring and related charges of 14 million net of 07 million in tax an impairment charge of 21 million net of 13 million in tax an increase in acquisitionrelated contingencies of 10 million net of 02 million in tax a loss on extinguishment of debt of 98 million net of 18 million in tax and discrete tax charges of 21 million

cash flows 

the following table presents cash flow data for the years ended december 31  



net cash provided by operating activities 

2014 compared to 2013   

net cash provided by operating activities was 1829 million in 2014 a decrease of 376 million from 2013 net cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2014 due to a 272 million increase in pension plan contributions and our receipt of a nonrefundable customer payment of 200 million in june 2013 in return for the exclusive use of smartdose within a specific therapeutic area 

2013 compared to 2012   

net cash provided by operating activities was 2205 million in 2013 an increase of 331 million from 2012 net cash provided by operating activities increased in 2013 primarily due to the increase in net income and our receipt of a nonrefundable customer payment of 200 million in june 2013 in return for the exclusive use of smartdose within a specific therapeutic area both of which were partially offset by higher working capital requirements and the timing of other payments 

net cash used in investing activities   

2014 compared to 2013   

net cash used in investing activities was 1040 million in 2014 a decrease of 459 million from 2013 net cash used in investing activities decreased in 2014 due to a 400 million decrease in capital spending to 1119 million mainly as the construction of our corporate office and research building was completed in february 2013 the majority of the capital spending for 2014 related to new products expansion activity and emerging markets including projects in the us europe china and india 

in october 2014 we announced plans to expand our global manufacturing operations to include a new facility in waterford ireland which will produce packaging components for insulin injector cartridges and other highvalue packaging components construction is planned to begin in 2015 subject to the project obtaining requisite planning and zoning approvals 

2013 compared to 2012   

net cash used in investing activities was 1499 million in 2013 an increase of 339 million from 2012 net cash used in investing activities increased in 2013 primarily due to a 206 million increase in capital spending to 1519 million in 2013 the majority of the increased capital spending was related to construction of our corporate office and research building which began in 2011 and settled in february 2013 construction of our new rubber and metal manufacturing facility in india and various capital projects related to new products expansion activity and emerging markets net cash used in investing activities also increased in 2013 due to the change in our shortterm investment activity during 2013 we sold 191 million and purchased 142 million of shortterm investments during 2012 we sold 456 million and purchased 312 million of shortterm investments the shortterm investments represent certificates of deposit primarily in israel with maturities between ninetyone days and one year at the time of purchase 

net cash used in financing activities 

2014 compared to 2013 

net cash used in financing activities was 308 million in 2014 an increase of 257 million from 2013 net cash used in financing activities for 2014 increased primarily due to an increase in net repayments of debt and a 74 million decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock appreciation rights 

we paid cash dividends totaling 291 million 041 per share and 267 million 0385 per share during 2014 and 2013 respectively 

on october 29 2014 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1000 million of our common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as permitted under the regulations of the securities and exchange commission the extent to which we repurchase the shares and the timing of any repurchases will be determined by us based on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors the program is expected to be completed no later than december 31 2015 as of december 31 2014 no shares had been repurchased under the program 

2013 compared to 2012 

net cash used in financing activities was 51 million in 2013 an increase of 17 million from 2012 net cash used in financing activities for 2013 increased primarily due to a reduction in our net debt activity partially offset by a 130 million increase in proceeds from exercises of stock options and stock appreciation rights as compared to 2012 during 2013 upon settlement of our corporate office and research building we borrowed 428 million under a revolving credit facility which was immediately converted to a fiveyear term loan due january 2018 a portion of the loan was used to pay the 353 million in outstanding obligations at december 31 2012 related to the construction and acquisition of the building during 2013 we also entered into eurodenominated debt under our multicurrency revolving credit facility and used a portion of our multicurrency revolving credit facility to repay our euro note a that matured on february 27 2013 during 2013 we also repurchased 25 million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible debentures during 2012 we used our multicurrency revolving credit facility to fund our repurchase of 1584 million of our convertible debentures and we incurred debt issuance costs of 75 million which primarily consisted of the settlement payment made by us for two treasury lock agreements that we entered into and subsequently terminated 

we paid cash dividends totaling 267 million 0385 per share and 249 million 0365 per share during 2013 and 2012 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

the table below presents selected liquidity and capital measures as of 



cash and cash equivalents include all instruments that have maturities of ninety days or less when purchased shortterm investments include all instruments that have maturities between ninetyone days and one year at the time of purchase working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents and total invested capital is defined as the sum of net debt and total equity 

cash and cash equivalents –  our cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2014 consisted of cash held in depository accounts with banks around the world and cash invested in highquality shortterm investments the cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2014 included 472 million of cash held by subsidiaries within the us and 2081 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the us primarily in germany and singapore which is available to fund operations and growth of nonus subsidiaries repatriating the cash into the us could trigger us federal state and local income tax obligations however we may temporarily access cash held by our nonus subsidiaries without becoming subject to us income tax by entering into shortterm intercompany loans 

working capital   working capital at december 31 2014 decreased by 70 million or 17 during 2014 as compared to 2013 including a decrease of 359 million due to foreign currency translation excluding the impact of currency exchange rates cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and inventories increased by 481 million 59 million and 162 million respectively and total current liabilities increased by 281 million accounts receivable turnover measurements improved between december 31 2013 and december 31 2014 while inventory turnover measurements remained consistent the increase in current liabilities was primarily due to the reclassification of our series b notes from longterm debt to current liabilities 

debt and credit facilities   the 368 million decrease in total debt at december 31 2014 as compared to december 31 2013 resulted from net repayments of 229 million and foreign currency rate fluctuations of 139 million 

our sources of liquidity include our multicurrency revolving credit facility which expires in april 2017 and contains a 3000 million committed credit facility and an accordion feature allowing the maximum to be increased through a term loan to 3500 million upon approval by the banks borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to onemonth london interbank offering rates libor plus a margin ranging from 125 to 225 percentage points which is based on the ratio of our senior debt to modified earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda at december 31 2014 we had 297 million in outstanding borrowings under this facility of which 42 million was denominated in yen and 255 million was denominated in euro the total amount outstanding at december 31 2014 and 2013 was classified as longterm these borrowings together with outstanding letters of credit of 35 million resulted in a borrowing capacity available under this facility of 2668 million at december 31 2014 we do not expect any significant limitations on our ability to access this source of funds 

pursuant to the financial covenants in our debt agreements we are required to maintain established interest coverage ratios and to not exceed established leverage ratios in addition the agreements contain other customary covenants none of which we consider restrictive to our operations at december 31 2014 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements throughout 2015 

we believe that cash on hand and cash generated from operations together with availability under our multicurrency revolving credit facility will be adequate to address our foreseeable liquidity needs based on our current expectations of our business operations capital expenditures and scheduled payments of debt obligations 

commitments and contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments at december 31 2014 these obligations are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity 



 

 

 

 

reserves for uncertain tax positions   the table above does not include 69 million  of total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2014  due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for amounts which may be paid 

letters of credit   we have letters of credit totaling 35 million  supporting the reimbursement of workers compensation and other claims paid on our behalf by insurance carriers the accrual for insurance obligations was 87 million  at december 31 2014  of which 46 million  is in excess of our deductible and therefore is reimbursable by the insurance company 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2014 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases unconditional purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business and outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

managements discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with us gaap the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions some of which are subjective and complex that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our results of operations and financial position 

revenue recognition  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists title and risk of loss have transferred the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured generally sales are recognized upon shipment or upon delivery to our customers site based upon shipping terms or legal requirements some customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes we record rebate costs when sales occur based on our assessment of the likelihood that the required volumes will be attained we also maintain an allowance for product returns as we believe that we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of returns based on our substantial historical experience 

impairment of longlived assets longlived assets including property plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable an asset is considered impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future expected undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset once an asset is considered impaired an impairment loss is recorded within other income expense for the difference between the assets carrying value and its fair value for assets held and used in the business management determines fair value using estimated future cash flows to be derived from the asset discounted to a net present value using an appropriate discount rate for assets held for sale or for investment purposes management determines fair value by estimating the proceeds to be received upon sale of the asset less disposition costs 

during 2012 as a result of continuing delays and lowerthanexpected demand we updated the sales projections related to one of our delivery systems product lines the revised projections triggered an impairment review of the associated assets our review concluded that the estimated fair value of the product line no longer exceeded the carrying value of the related assembly equipment and intangible asset and therefore an impairment charge of 34 million was recorded 32 million of which was for the related assembly equipment we estimated the fair value of the asset group using an income approach based on discounted cash flows 

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually following the completion of our annual budget and longrange planning process or whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is the same as or one level below our operating segments recent accounting guidance allows entities to first assess qualitative factors including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors and overall financial performance to determine whether it is necessary to perform the first step of the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test we considered this guidance when performing our annual impairment testing but elected to continue utilizing the twostep quantitative impairment test the first step in the twostep test is to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill if the carrying amount exceeds fair value the second step must be performed the second step requires the comparison of the carrying amount of the goodwill to its implied fair value which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired as of the testing date any excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the implied fair value would represent an impairment loss considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test such as future sales future cash flows and longterm growth rates are consistent with internal projections and operating plans amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test are also largely dependent on the continued sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products as well as our timeliness and success in newproduct innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems changes in the estimate of fair value including the estimate of future cash flows could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position no impairment in the carrying value of our reporting units was evident as a result of our annual review of goodwill with the exception of our delivery systems europe reporting unit which had a fair value in 

excess of its carrying value of 23 and which is largely dependent on the continued and anticipated demand for certain of its contract manufacturing and proprietary safety systems products each of our reporting units whose assets included goodwill had a fair value in excess of its respective carrying value of at least 32 at december 31 2014 the goodwill associated with the delivery systems europe reporting unit equaled 86 million or 79 of our total goodwill 

certain trademarks have been determined to have indefinite lives and therefore are not subject to amortization similar to the impairment testing for goodwill there is an option to first assess qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test we considered this option when performing our impairment testing but elected to continue utilizing a quantitative test comparing the fair value and carrying value of the asset any excess carrying value would represent an impairment loss fair values are determined using discounted cash flow analyses 

intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 

as discussed above during 2012 an impairment charge of 34 million was recorded as the estimated fair value of one of our delivery systems product lines no longer exceeded the carrying value of the related assembly equipment and intangible asset the impairment charge for the intangible asset was 02 million see above for further discussion 

employee benefits  we maintain funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans in the us and a number of other countries that cover employees who meet eligibility requirements in addition we sponsor postretirement benefit plans which provide healthcare benefits for eligible employees who retire or become disabled the measurement of annual cost and obligations under these defined benefit postretirement plans is subject to a number of assumptions which are specific for each of our us and foreign plans the assumptions which are reviewed at least annually are relevant to both the plan assets where applicable and the obligation for benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees two of the most critical assumptions in determining pension and retiree medical plan expense are the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement age rates of compensation increases mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience for our funded plans we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our plan assets as well as historical and expected rates of return in estimating the longterm rate of return on plan assets under us gaap differences between actual and expected results are generally accumulated in other comprehensive income loss as actuarial gains or losses and subsequently amortized into earnings over future periods 

changes in key assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position we estimate that every 25 basis point reduction in our longterm rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by 06 million and every 25 basis point reduction in our discount rate would increase pension expense by 06 million a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations our net pension underfunded balance at december 31 2014 was 762 million compared to 761 million at december 31 2013 our underfunded balance for other postretirement benefits was 101 million at december 31 2014 compared to 92 million at december 31 2013 

in october 2014 the society of actuaries released final reports containing new mortality tables and an improvement scale that suggested significant mortality improvements after an analysis of our actual mortality experience we adopted the rp2014 mortality table without collar adjustment and applied scale bb 2dimensional mortality improvements this adoption increased our us benefit obligations by 61 million at december 31 2014 

income taxes  we estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation in addition deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established to recognize differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities we maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized the recoverability of tax assets is subject to our estimates of future profitability generally at the respective subsidiary company and country level changes in tax legislation business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined 

when accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements we apply a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 

contingent consideration 

the fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to smartdose smartdose contingent consideration was initially determined using a probabilityweighted income approach and is revalued at each reporting date or more frequently if circumstances dictate changes in the fair value of this obligation are recorded as income or expense within other income expense in our consolidated statements of income the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration are the sales projections the probability of success factors and the discount rate significant increases or decreases in any of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement as development and commercialization of smartdose progresses we may need to update the sales projections the probability of success factors and the discount rate used this could result in a material increase or decrease to the contingent consideration liability 

see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 2 new accounting standards  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on accounting and reporting standards considered in the preparation and presentation of our financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risk factors such as fluctuating interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and increasing commodity prices these risk factors can impact our results of operations cash flows and financial position to manage these risks we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps call options and forward exchange contracts for periods consistent with and for notional amounts equal to or less than the underlying exposures in accordance with company policy derivative financial instruments are not used for speculation or trading purposes 

foreign currency exchange risk 

sales outside of the us accounted for 54 of consolidated net sales in 2014 virtually all of these sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into us dollars for consolidated reporting purposes although the majority of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary they may also hold assets or liabilities denominated in other currencies these items may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains and losses as a result our results of operations and financial position are exposed to changing currency exchange rates we periodically use forward contracts to hedge certain transactions or to neutralize monthend balance sheet exposures on crosscurrency intercompany loans 

we have designated our €611 million euro note b and our €210 million eurodenominated borrowings under our revolving credit facility as a hedge of our net investment in certain european subsidiaries we also have ¥5000 million in yendenominated borrowings under our revolving credit facility which has been designated as a hedge of our net investment in daikyo at december 31 2014 a net cumulative foreign currency translation gain on these hedges of 54 million net of tax of 33 million was recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss 

interest rate risk    

as a result of our normal borrowing activities we have longterm debt with both fixed and variable interest rates longterm debt consists of senior notes revolving credit facilities and capital lease obligations our exposures to fluctuations in interest rates are managed to the extent considered necessary by entering into interest rate swap agreements 

the following table summarizes our interest rate risksensitive instruments 



1 as of december 31 2014  we have two interest rate swap agreements outstanding the first agreement is designed to protect against volatility in variable interest rates payable on our 250 million senior floating rate notes maturing july 28 2015 “series b notes” at december 31 2014  this agreement had a fair value of 06 million unfavorable to the company which was recorded as a current liability the second agreement is a forwardstart interest rate swap designed to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the applicable interest rate of our 392 million fiveyear term loan at december 31 2014  this agreement had a fair value of 30 million unfavorable to the company which was recorded as a noncurrent liability refer to note 9 derivative financial instruments  for additional information on these interest rate hedges 

commodity price risk 

many of our packaging systems products are made from synthetic elastomers which are derived from the petroleum refining process we purchase the majority of our elastomers via longterm supply contracts some of which contain clauses that provide for surcharges related to fluctuations in crude oil prices in recent years increases in raw material costs have had an adverse impact on us we expect the volatility in raw material prices to continue we will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects on gross profit 

in november 2014 we purchased a series of call options for a total of 134700 barrels of crude oil to mitigate our exposure to such oilbased surcharges and protect operating cash flows with regard to a portion of our forecasted elastomer purchases through december 2015 with these contracts we may benefit from a decline in crude oil prices as there is no downward exposure other than the 01 million premium that we paid to purchase the contracts 

during the year ended december 31 2014 and 2013 a loss of 01 million and 01 million respectively was recorded in cost of goods and services sold related to call options

business segments 

our business operations are organized into two reportable segments which are aligned with the underlying markets and customers they serve our reportable segments are the pharmaceutical packaging systems segment “packaging systems” and the pharmaceutical delivery systems segment “delivery systems” 

packaging systems segment 

our packaging systems segment develops manufactures and sells primary packaging components and systems for injectable drug delivery including stoppers and seals for vials closures and other components used in syringe intravenous and blood collection systems and prefillable syringe components the growth strategy for packaging systems includes organic growth through market segmentation newproduct innovation strategic acquisitions and geographic expansion we have manufacturing facilities in north and south america europe and asia with affiliated companies in mexico and japan see item 2 properties    for additional information on our manufacturing and other sites 

packaging systems consists of three operating segments  americas europe and asia pacific  which are aggregated for reporting purposes 

packaging systems products generally consist of elastomeric components offered in a variety of standard and customerspecific configurations and formulations which are available with advanced barrier films and coatings to enhance their performance west flurotec barrier film is applied to reduce the risk of product loss by contamination and protect the shelf life of packaged drugs we also apply a teflon coating to the surface of stoppers and plungers to improve compatibility between the closure and the drug b2coating is a coating applied to the surface of stoppers and plungers using a process that eliminates the need for conventional silicone application it helps manufacturers reduce product rejections due to trace levels of silicone molecules found in noncoated packaged drug compounds flurotec and b2coating technologies are licensed from daikyo 

in addition our westar® rs and westar ru postmanufacturing processes are documented and fully validated procedures for washing and siliconizing stoppers and syringe components to remove biological materials and endotoxins the westar rs process prepares components for introduction into the customers sterilizer and the westar ru process provides sterilized components these processes increase the overall efficiency of injectable drug production by outsourcing component processing thereby eliminating steps otherwise required in each of our customers manufacturing processes and help to assure compliance with the latest regulatory requirements for component preparation we also offer envision™ components that are inspected using automated vision inspection systems ensuring that components plungers and stoppers meet enhanced quality specifications for visible and subvisible particulate and contamination 

our recentlyintroduced novapure ®  components which include serum and lyophilization stoppers and syringe plungers incorporate quality by design principles and are manufactured utilizing advanced process technologies the closures provide the highest levels of quality to the market helping to ensure the safety efficacy and purity of injectable drug products 

our tamperevident flipoff® seals are sold in a wide range of sizes and colors to meet customers needs for product identification and differentiation the seals can be provided using proprietary printing for cautionary statements and embossing technology that can serve as a counterfeiting deterrence 

as an adjunct to our packaging systems products we offer contract analytical laboratory services for testing and evaluating primary drugpackaging components and their compatibility with the contained drug formulation west analytical services provides us and our customers with indepth knowledge and analysis of the interaction and compatibility of drug products with elastomer glass and plastic packaging components our analytical laboratories also provide specialized testing for complete drug delivery systems 

see note 4 segment information  for net sales information for packaging systems 

delivery systems segment 

our delivery systems segment develops manufactures and sells safety and administration systems multicomponent systems for drug administration and a variety of custom contractmanufacturing solutions targeted to the healthcare and consumerproducts industries delivery systems has expertise in product design and development including inhouse mold design and construction an engineering center for developmental and prototype tooling process design and validation and highspeed automated assemblies in addition delivery systems is responsible for the continued development and commercialization of our line of proprietary healthcare administrative and advanced injection systems including daikyo cz smartdose® and other systems delivery systems has manufacturing operations in north america and europe see item 2 properties  for additional information on our manufacturing and other sites 

delivery systems offers a variety of products and services which are described below 

we offer customer contractmanufacturing and assembly solutions which use such technologies as multicomponent molding inmold labeling ultrasonic welding and clean room molding and device assembly used to manufacture customerowned components and devices used in surgical diagnostic ophthalmic other drug delivery systems personal care and consumer products 

our administration systems include sterile devices for the administration of drug products including patented products such as the mixject tm  transfer device the mix2vial tm  needleless reconstitution system and vial adapters 

examples of our safety systems that are designed to prevent needle sticks are éris tm and novaguard tm sa for prefilled syringes and novaguard lp for luer lock syringes 

the daikyo cz 1ml long insert needle syringe system is the markets first syringe system without silicone oil lubrication applied to the barrel or plunger that incorporates an insertmolded needle to avoid the need for adhesive the luer lock version of the daikyo cz syringe system was introduced previously along with several sizes of sterile vials additional sizes of vials continue to be introduced cz technology is licensed from daikyo 

our smartdose electronic patch injector system is under evaluation by many biopharmaceutical companies this system is designed for controlled subcutaneous delivery of high volume and high viscosity drugs using prefilled daikyo cz cartridges the system is fully programmable has a single pushbutton operation and a hidden needle for safety 

the confidose® autoinjector and selfdose tm  selfinjection systems enhance patient compliance and safety the needle remains shielded at all times and retracts automatically after the injection these systems eliminate preparation steps and automate the injection of drugs providing patients with a sterile singleuse disposable system that can be readily used at home 

see note 4 segment information  for net sales information for delivery systems 

restructuring initiatives 

in december 2010 our board of directors approved a restructuring plan the 2010 plan designed to reduce our cost structure and improve operating efficiency the 2010 plan involved the 2011 closure of a plant in the united states us a reduction in operations at a manufacturing facility in england and the elimination of certain operational and administrative functions at other locations under the 2010 plan we incurred restructuring and related charges of 219 million including 21 million in 2012 and 53 million in 2011 we did not incur any restructuring and related charges related to the 2010 plan during 2013 and we do not expect to incur any future charges related to the 2010 plan the remaining restructuring obligations related to the 2010 plan were reduced to zero at december 31 2013 

see note 2 restructuring and other items  for further discussion 

international 

we have significant operations outside of the us which are managed through the same business segments as our us operations – packaging systems and delivery systems sales outside of the us accounted for 55 of consolidated net sales in 2013 for a geographic breakdown of sales see note 4 segment information  

although the general business processes are similar to the domestic business international operations are exposed to additional risks these risks include currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar multiple tax jurisdictions and particularly in south america and israel political and social issues that could destabilize local markets and affect the demand for our products 

see further discussion of our international operations the risks associated with our international operations and our attempt to minimize some of these risks in part i item 1a risk factors  part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resources part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  note 1   under the captions financial instruments  and foreign currency translation and note 11 derivative financial instruments  

raw materials 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers aluminum and plastic elastomers include both natural and synthetic materials we currently have access to adequate supplies of these raw materials to meet our production needs through agreements with suppliers 

we employ a supplychain management strategy in our business segments which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply due to regulatory control over our production processes and the cost and time involved in qualifying suppliers we rely on singlesource suppliers for many critical raw materials we purchase certain of our raw materials in the open market this strategy increases the risk that our supply chain may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production problem these risks are managed where possible by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites rigorous quality control systems surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in case of an interruption in production 

intellectual property rights 

intellectual property including patents trade secrets and knowhow is important to our business we own or license intellectual property rights including issued patents and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries that relate to various aspects of our products in particular key valueadded and proprietary products and processes are licensed from daikyo our intellectual property rights have been useful in establishing our market share and in the growth of our business and are expected to continue to be of value in the future although important in the aggregate we do not consider our business to be materially dependent on any individual patent or license 

seasonality 

although our packaging systems business is not inherently seasonal sales and operating profit in the second half of the year are typically lower than the first half primarily due to scheduled plant shutdowns in conjunction with our customers production schedules and the yearend impact of holidays on production 

working capital 

we are required to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet customer requirements in addition some of our supply agreements require us to purchase inventory in bulk orders which increases inventory levels but decreases the risk of supply interruption levels of inventory are also influenced by the seasonal patterns addressed above for a more detailed discussion of working capital please see the discussion in part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resource s 

marketing 

our packaging systems customers include practically every major branded pharmaceutical generic and biopharmaceutical company in the world packaging systems components and other products are sold to major pharmaceutical biotechnology and hospital supplymedical device companies which incorporate them into their products for distribution to the ultimate enduser 

our delivery systems segment sells to many of the worlds largest pharmaceutical biopharmaceutical and medical device companies and to large customers within the personal care and foodandbeverage industries delivery systems components generally are incorporated into our customers manufacturing lines for further processing or assembly 

our products and services are distributed primarily through our own sales force and distribution network with limited use of contract sales agents and regional distributors 

our ten largest customers accounted for 392 of our consolidated net sales in 2013 but none of these customers individually accounted for more than 10 of net sales 

order backlog 

at december 31 2013 and 2012 the order backlog for packaging systems was 3366 million and 3491 million respectively the decrease in the order backlog for packaging systems reflects a combination of factors including several customers completing strategic stockbuilding and our improved delivery performance and resulting shorter leadtimes particularly for some key highvalue products order backlog includes firm orders placed by customers for manufacture over a period of time according to their schedule or upon confirmation by the customer we also have contractual arrangements with a number of our customers products covered by these contracts are included in our backlog only as orders are received the entire order backlog for packaging systems at december 31 2013 is expected to be filled during 2014 

competition 

we compete with several companies across our packaging systems product lines however we believe that we supply a major portion of the us market for pharmaceutical elastomer and metal packaging components and also have a significant share of the european market for these components because of the special nature of our pharmaceutical packaging components and our longstanding participation in the market competition is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive costcontrol programs across their operations 

we differentiate ourselves from our competition as a fullservice valueadded global supplier that can provide presale formula and engineering development analytical services regulatory expertise and postmanufacturing technologies as well as aftersale technical support customers also appreciate the global scope of wests manufacturing capability and our ability to produce many products at multiple sites 

our delivery systems business competes in very competitive markets for both healthcare and consumer products the markets we serve are also served by many competitors and therefore our market shares are generally less than 5 of the total global markets the competition varies from smaller regional companies to large global molders that command significant market shares there are extreme cost pressures and many of our customers look offshore to reduce cost we differentiate ourselves by leveraging our global capability and by employing new technologies such as highspeed automated assembly insertmolding multishot molding and expertise with multiplepiece closure systems 

because of the more demanding regulatory requirements in the medical device component area there are a smaller number of competitors mostly largescale companies we compete for this market on the basis of our reputation for quality and reliability in engineering and project management diverse contract manufacturing capabilities and knowledge of and experience in complying with fda requirements with our range of proprietary technologies we compete with new and established companies in the area of drug delivery devices including suppliers of prefillable syringes autoinjectors safety needles and other proprietary systems 

research and development activities 

we maintain our own researchscale production facilities and laboratories for developing new products and offer contract engineering design and development services to assist customers with new product development our quality control regulatory and laboratory testing capabilities are used to ensure compliance with applicable manufacturing and regulatory standards for primary and secondary pharmaceutical packaging components the engineering departments are responsible for product and tooling design and testing and for the design and construction of processing equipment we continue to seek new innovative opportunities for acquisition licensing partnering or development within injectable packaging and delivery systems most of which will be manufactured and marketed by our delivery systems segment research and development spending will continue to increase as we pursue innovative strategic platforms in prefillable syringe injectable container advanced injection and safety and administration systems 

commercial development of our new products and services for medical and pharmaceutical applications commonly requires several years new products that we develop may require separate approval as medical devices and products that are intended to be used in packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical products will be subject to both customer acceptance of our products and regulatory approval of the customers products following our development period 

we spent 151 million in 2013 127 million in 2012 and 116 million in 2011 on research and development for packaging systems delivery systems incurred research and development costs of 228 million 205 million and 175 million in the years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2013 and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes in 2014 

employees 

as of december 31 2013 we employed approximately 6900 people in our operations throughout the world 




 item 1a risk factors 

the statements in this section describe major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this form 10k contains some forwardlooking statements that are based on managements beliefs and assumptions current expectations estimates and forecasts we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forwardlooking statements such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts we have attempted wherever possible to identify forwardlooking statements by using words such as “estimate” “expect” “intend” “believe” “plan” “anticipate” and other words and terms of similar meaning in particular these include statements relating to future actions business plans and prospects new products future performance or results of current or anticipated products sales efforts expenses interest rates foreignexchange rates economic effects the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results 

many of the factors that will determine our future results are beyond our ability to control or predict achievement of future results is subject to known or unknown risks or uncertainties and therefore actual results could differ materially from past results and those expressed or implied in any forwardlooking statement you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements 

unless required by applicable securities law we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise we also refer you to further disclosures we make on related subjects in our quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k to the sec 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 

the current uncertainty in the global economy including the continuing effects of recession or slow economic growth in the us and europe may negatively affect our operating results examples of the effects of these continuing global economic challenges include our suppliers and our customers inability to access the credit markets at commercially reasonable rates reduction in sales due to customers decreasing their inventories in the nearterm or longterm or due to liquidity difficulties reduction in sales due to shortages of materials we purchase from our suppliers reduction in research and development efforts and expenditures by our customers our inability to hedge our currency and raw material risks sufficiently or at commercially reasonable prices insolvency of suppliers or customers inflationary pressures on our supplies or our products and increased expenses due to growing taxation of corporate profits or revenues our operating results in one or more geographic regions may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region if economic and market conditions in the us or europe weaken further we may experience material adverse impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our sales and profitability are largely dependent on the sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products if the products developed by our customers in the future use another delivery system our sales and profitability could suffer 

our business depends to a substantial extent on customers continued sales and development of products that are delivered by injection if our customers fail to continue to sell develop and deploy new injectable products or we are unable to develop new products that assist in the delivery of drugs by alternative methods our sales and profitability may suffer 

if we are unable to provide comparative value advantages timely fulfillment of customer orders or resist pricing pressure we will have to reduce our prices which may reduce our profit margins 

we compete with several companies across our major product lines because of the special nature of these products competition is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive cost control programs across their entire operations competitors often compete on the basis of price we differentiate ourselves from our competition as a fullservice valueadded supplier that is able to provide presale compatibility studies and other services and sophisticated postsale technical support on a global basis however we face continued pricing pressure from our customers and competitors if we are unable to resist or to offset the effects of continued pricing pressure through our valueadded services improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures or if we have to reduce our prices our sales and profitability may suffer 

consolidation in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries have experienced a significant amount of consolidation as a result of this consolidation competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased in addition group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has placed pricing pressure on suppliers further consolidation within the industries we serve could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products 

we are subject to regulation by governments around the world and if these regulations are not complied with existing and future operations may be curtailed and we could be subject to liability 

the design development manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our products and our customers products that incorporate our products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the us europe and other countries including the fda and the european medicines agency complying with governmental regulation can be costly and can result in required modification or withdrawal of existing products and a substantial delay in the introduction of new products failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or failure to obtain regulatory approval for a new product could result in expenses and actions that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

products incorporating our technologies are subject to regulations and extensive approval or clearance processes which make the timing and success of newproduct commercialization difficult to predict 

the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is expensive and timeconsuming historically most medical devices incorporating our technologies have been subject to the fdas 510k marketing approval process which typically lasts from six to nine months supplemental or full premarket approval reviews require a significantly longer period delaying commercialization pharmaceutical products incorporating our technologies are subject to the fdas new drug application process which typically takes a number of years to complete   additionally biotechnology products incorporating our technologies are subject to the fdas biologics license application process which also typically takes a number of years to complete outside of the us sales of medical devices and pharmaceutical or biotechnology products are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary from country to country the time required to obtain approval for sale internationally may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 

changes in the regulation of drug products and devices may increase competitive pressure and adversely affect our business 

an effect of the governmental regulation of our customers drug products devices and manufacturing processes is that compliance with regulations makes it costly and timeconsuming for customers to substitute or replace components and devices produced by one supplier with those from another the regulation of our customers products that incorporate our components and devices has increased over time if the applicable regulations were to be modified in a way that reduced the cost and time involved for customers to substitute one suppliers components or devices for those made by another it is likely that the competitive pressure would increase and adversely affect our sales and profitability 

if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights we may harm our ability to compete 

our patents trademarks and other intellectual property are important to our business we rely on patent trademark copyright trade secret and other intellectual property laws as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary information technologies and process we also have obligations with respect to the nonuse and nondisclosure of third party intellectual property we may need to engage in litigation or similar activities to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others any such litigation could require us to expend significant resources and divert the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel from our business operations we cannot assure you that the steps we will take to prevent misappropriation infringement or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of others will be successful in addition effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for some of our trademarks and patents in some countries failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business and results of operations in addition we may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar or duplicative to ours 

disruption in our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make and sell products and have a negative impact on our reputation performance or financial condition 

we have manufacturing sites all over the world in addition in some instances the manufacturing of certain product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants the functioning of our manufacturing and distribution assets and systems could be disrupted for reasons either within or beyond our control including extreme weather or longerterm climatic changes natural disasters pandemic war accidental damage disruption to the supply of material or services product quality and safety issues systems failure workforce actions or environmental contamination there is a risk that incident management systems in place may prove inadequate and that any disruption may materially adversely affect our ability to make and sell products and therefore materially adversely affect our reputation performance or financial condition 

the medical technology industry is very competitive and customer demands andor new products in the marketplace could cause a reduction in demand 

the medical technology industry is subject to rapid technological changes and we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold we face this competition from a wide range of companies these include large medical device companies some of which have greater financial and marketing resources than we do we also face competition from firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets in some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for diseases that may be delivered without a medical device the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology may render some of our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive in addition failure to meet increased customer quality expectations could cause a reduction in demand 

our international sales and operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that vary by country and which could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

we conduct business in most of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world our international operations and our ability to implement our overall business strategy including our plan to continue expanding into emerging andor fastergrowing markets outside the us are subject to risks and uncertainties that can vary by country and include transportation delays and interruptions political and economic instability and disruptions imposition of duties and tariffs import and export controls the risks of divergent business expectations or cultural incompatibility inherent in establishing and maintaining operations in foreign countries difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations labor strikes andor disputes and potentially adverse tax consequences limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies with third parties or our joint venture partners outside of the us could also create exposure in addition we may not be able to operate in compliance with foreign laws and regulations or comply with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject in the event that these laws or regulations change any of these events could have an adverse effect on our international operations in the future by reducing the demand for our products decreasing the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

sales outside of the us accounted for 55 of our consolidated net sales in 2013 we anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales and we intend to continue our expansion into emerging andor fastergrowing markets outside of the us in addition many of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside of the us virtually all of the international sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into us dollars which can result in significant fluctuations in the amount of those sales or earnings the exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future in addition to translation risks we incur currency transaction gains or losses when we or one of our subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction in a currency other than that entitys local currency in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in certain exchange rates we have entered and expect to enter into hedging arrangements including the use of financial derivatives there can be no certainty that we will be able to enter into or maintain effective hedges of currency risks which could have a significant effect on our financial condition and operating results 

disruptions in the supply of key raw materials could adversely impact our operations 

we generally purchase our raw materials and supplies required for the production of our products in the open market for reasons of quality assurance sole source availability or cost effectiveness many components and raw materials are available andor purchased only from a single supplier due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the fda and other regulatory authorities regarding the manufacture of our products we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for these components or materials or do so without excessive cost as a result a reduction or interruption in manufacturing or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components could have a material adverse effect on our business andor results of operations 

raw material and energy prices have a significant impact on our profitability if raw material andor energy prices increase and we cannot pass those price increases on to our customers our profitability and financial condition may suffer 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers which include synthetic and natural material aluminum and plastic in addition our manufacturing facilities consume a wide variety of energy products to fuel heat and cool our operations supply and demand factors which are beyond our control generally affect the price of our raw materials and utility costs if we are unable to pass along increased raw material prices and energy costs to our customers our profitability and thus our financial condition may be adversely affected the prices of many of these raw materials and utilities are cyclical and volatile for example the prices of certain commodities particularly petroleumbased raw materials have in the recent past exhibited rapid changes affecting the cost of synthetic elastomers and plastic while we generally attempt to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of sales price increases historically there has been a time delay between raw material andor energy price increases and our ability to increase the prices of our products in some circumstances we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pressure and other factors 

if we are not timely or successful in newproduct innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems our future revenues and operating income could be adversely affected 

our growth partly depends on newproduct innovation and the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications such as the daikyo cz readytouse prefilled syringe system product development and commercialization is inherently uncertain and is subject to a number of factors outside of our control including any necessary regulatory approvals and commercial acceptance for the products the ultimate timing and successful commercialization of new products and systems requires substantial evaluations of the functional operational clinical and economic viability of the companys products in addition the timely and adequate availability of filling capacity is essential to both conducting definitive stability trials and the timing of first commercialization of customers products in cz prefilled syringes delays interruptions or failures in developing and commercializing newproduct innovations or proprietary multicomponent systems could adversely affect future revenues and operating income in addition adverse conditions may also result in future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we may not succeed in finding and completing acquisition or other strategic transactions if any which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we have historically engaged in acquisition activity and we may in the future engage in acquisitions or other strategic transactions such as joint ventures or investments in other entities we may be unable to identify suitable targets opportunistic or otherwise for acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future if we identify a suitable candidate our ability to successfully implement the strategic transaction would depend on a variety of factors including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and to comply with the restrictions contained in our debt agreements strategic transactions involve risks including those associated with integrating the operations or maintaining the operations as separate as applicable financial reporting disparate technologies and personnel of acquired companies joint ventures or related companies managing geographically dispersed operations or other strategic investments the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience unknown risks and the potential loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies joint ventures or companies in which we may make strategic investments we may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire or strategically develop in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits relating to any such strategic transactions strategic transactions may be expensive time consuming and may strain our resources strategic transactions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of among other things the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and amortization expenses of other intangible assets in addition strategic transactions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities 

product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 

the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects unanticipated use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market a recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals 

our operations must comply with environmental statutes and regulations and any failure to comply could result in extensive costs which would harm our business 

the manufacture of some of our products involves the use transportation storage and disposal of hazardous or toxic materials and is subject to various environmental protection and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate this has exposed us in the past and could expose us in the future to risks of accidental contamination and events of noncompliance with environmental laws any such occurrences could result in regulatory enforcement or personal injury and property damage claims or could lead to a shutdown of some of our operations which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations we currently incur costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations and these costs may become more significant 

a loss of key personnel or highly skilled employees could disrupt our operations 

our executive officers are critical to the management and direction of our businesses our future success depends in large part on our ability to retain these officers and other key employees including people in technical marketing sales and research positions competition for experienced employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees our business could be adversely affected although we believe that we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise our inability to do so on a timely basis could disrupt the operations of the unit affected or our overall operations in addition because of the complex nature of many of our products and programs we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled engineering staff and workforce our operations could be disrupted by a shortage of available skilled employees 

the uncertain effects of potential climate change legislation could lead to significantly increased costs 

if legislation or regulations are enacted or promulgated in the us europe or asia or any other jurisdictions in which we do business that limit or reduce allowable greenhouse gas emissions and other emissions such restrictions could have a significant effect on our operating and financial decisions including those involving capital expenditures to reduce emissions and our results of operations our manufacturing operations may not be able to operate as planned if we are not able to comply with new legal and regulatory legislation around climate change or it may become too costly to operate in a profitable manner additionally suppliers added expenses could be passed on to us in the form of higher prices and we may not be able to pass on such expenses to our customers through price increases 

federal healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations 

the patient protection and affordable care act the “ppaca” was enacted in march 2010 the ppaca reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures the ppaca also imposes significant new taxes on medical device makers in the form of an excise tax on all us medical device sales as defined under the regulations these factors in turn could result in reduced demand for our products and increased downward pricing pressure it is also possible that the ppaca will result in lower reimbursements for our customers products while the ppaca is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the us the impact of any overall increase in access to healthcare on sales of wests products is uncertain at this time our sales depend in part on the extent to which pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities private insurers and other thirdparty payers for the costs of our products the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers which can vary among public and private sources may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these products in a particular jurisdiction legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the us as part of the ppaca or abroad for example those under consideration in france germany italy and the united kingdom could significantly reduce reimbursement for our customers products which could in turn reduce the demand for our products 

the full effects of the ppaca cannot be known until all of the provisions are implemented and the centers for medicare  medicaid services and other federal and state agencies issue applicable regulations or guidance moreover in the coming years additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our products we will continue to evaluate the ppaca as amended the implementation of regulations or guidance related to various provisions of the ppaca by federal agencies as well as trends and changes that may be encouraged by the legislation and that may potentially impact our business over time 

no assurance can be given that we will continue to pay or declare dividends 

we have historically paid dividends however there can be no assurance that we will pay or declare dividends in the future the actual declaration and payment of future dividends the amount of any such dividends and the establishment of record and payment dates if any are subject to determination by our board of directors each quarter after its review of our thencurrent strategy applicable debt covenants and financial performance and position among other things our declaration and payment of future dividends is subject to risks and uncertainties including deterioration of our financial performance or position inability to declare a dividend in compliance with applicable laws or debt covenants an increase in our cash needs or decrease in available cash and the business judgment of the board of directors that a declaration of a dividend is not in the companys best interests 

our results of operations and earnings may not meet guidance or expectations  

we provide public guidance on our expected results of operations for future periods this guidance is comprised of forwardlooking statements subject to risks and uncertainties including the risks and uncertainties described in this form 10k and in our other public filings and public statements and is based necessarily on assumptions we make at the time we provide such guidance our guidance may not always be accurate if in the future our results of operations for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or if we reduce our guidance for future periods the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 

we are exposed to credit risk on accounts receivable and certain prepayments made in the normal course of business this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

a substantial majority of our outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance in addition we have made prepayments associated with insurance premiums and other advances in the normal course of business while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on trade receivables and other current assets there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk and avoid losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

unauthorized access to our or our customers information and systems could negatively impact our business 

we may face certain security threats including threats to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data and systems we maintain an extensive network of technical security controls policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems in order to address these threats while these measures are designed to prevent detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems certain types of attacks could result in financial or information losses andor reputational harm if we cannot prevent the unauthorized access release andor corruption of our or our customers confidential classified or personally identifiable information our reputation could be damaged andor we could face financial losses 

if we fail to comply with our obligations under our distributorship or license agreements with daikyo or we are unable to renew these agreements on the same or substantially similar terms we could lose license rights that are important to our business 

key valueadded and proprietary products and processes are licensed from our affiliate daikyo including but not limited to daikyo cz flurotec and b2coating technologies our rights to these products and processes are licensed pursuant to agreements that expire in 2017 which we expect to renew prior to their expiration however if we are unsuccessful in renewing these agreements or if the agreements are terminated early because we fail to satisfy our obligations our business could be adversely impacted

our operations 

we are a manufacturer of components and systems for the packaging and delivery of injectable drugs as well as delivery system components for the pharmaceutical healthcare and consumer products industries our products include stoppers and seals for vials prefillable syringe components and systems components for intravenous and blood collection systems safety and administration systems advanced injection systems and contract design and manufacturing services our customers include the leading global producers and distributors of pharmaceuticals biologics medical devices and personal care products we were incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania on july 27 1923 

our business operations are organized into two reportable segments which are aligned with the underlying markets and customers they serve our reportable segments are packaging systems and delivery systems packaging systems develops manufactures and sells primary packaging components and systems for injectable drug delivery including stoppers and seals for vials closures and other components used in syringe intravenous and blood collection systems and prefillable syringe components delivery systems develops manufactures and sells safety and administration systems multicomponent systems for drug administration and a variety of custom contractmanufacturing solutions targeted to the healthcare and consumerproducts industries in addition delivery systems is responsible for the continued development and commercialization of our line of proprietary multicomponent systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications we also maintain global partnerships to share technologies and market products with affiliates in japan and mexico 

as a result of our global manufacturing and distribution presence more than half of our revenues are generated outside of the us in currencies other than the us dollar including 45 in europe and 10 collectively in asia south america and israel fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates therefore can have a significant effect on our consolidated financial results generally our financial results are affected positively by a weaker us dollar and negatively by a stronger us dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business in terms of net sales the most significant foreign currencies are the euro the danish krone the singapore dollar and the british pound with eurodenominated sales representing the majority of sales transacted in foreign currencies in addition we are exposed to the japanese yen yen as we maintain a 25 ownership interest in and we purchase finished goods and other materials from daikyo during 2013 average exchange rates were favorable versus the exchange rates realized in 2012 resulting in higher reported net sales and operating profit of 113 million and 24 million respectively versus 2012

stock effected in the form of a stock dividend the record date for the stock split was september 12 2013 and the 

share distribution occurred on september 26 2013 all share and per share amounts presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the stock 

split 

2013 financial performance highlights 

 

2014 business outlook 

we anticipate continued revenue and margin improvement driven by customers increasing demand for higher product quality which results in higher revenues and margin per unit sold in packaging systems and an increasing percentage of total sales from higher margin proprietary products in delivery systems we continue to believe that actions taken in recent years to increase capacity for certain products reduce costs through restructuring and lean savings efforts and expand into emerging markets will lead to improved profitability as global demand increases we plan to continue funding capital projects related to new products expansion activity and emerging markets for packaging systems and for new proprietary products within delivery systems we believe that our operating results and financial position give us a platform for sustained growth and will enable us to take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business as they arise see part i item 1a risk factors  of this form 10k for further discussion regarding the risks associated with our operations 

results of operations 

we evaluate the performance of our segments based upon among other things segment net sales and operating profit segment operating profit excludes general corporate costs which include executive and director compensation stockbased compensation adjustments to annual incentive plan expense for over or underattainment of targets certain pension and other retirement benefit costs and other corporate facilities and administrative expenses not allocated to the segments also excluded are items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations such items are referred to as other unallocated items and generally include restructuring and related charges certain asset impairments and other specificallyidentified income or expense items 

for the purpose of aiding the comparison of our yearoveryear results we may refer to net sales and other financial results excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates the constantcurrency amounts are calculated by translating the current year’s functional currency results at the prioryear period’s exchange rate these remeasured results excluding effects from currency translation are not in conformity with us gaap and should not be used as a substitute for the related us gaap financial measures the nonus gaap financial measures are incorporated into our discussion and analysis as management uses them in evaluating our results of operations and believes that this information provides users a valuable insight into our results 

percentages in the following tables and throughout the results of operations  section may reflect rounding adjustments

selling general and administrative “sga” costs 



2013 compared to 2012 

consolidated sga costs increased by 168 million or 77 in 2013 including the impact of foreign currency which increased sga costs by 05 million consolidated sga costs for both 2013 and 2012 were 172 of consolidated net sales for 2013 and 2012 

packaging systems – packaging systems sga costs increased by 117 million or 100 in 2013 primarily as a result of increased compensation costs mainly related to merit and headcount increases particularly in asia incremental consulting costs for supply chain initiatives and information technology projects incentive compensation cost increases and foreign currency effects which increased sga costs by 04 million 

delivery systems –  delivery systems sga costs increased by 56 million or 151 in 2013 primarily as a result of increased compensation costs incremental legal sales and marketing costs and foreign currency effects which increased sga costs by 01 million 

corporate –  corporates sga costs decreased by 05 million or 08 in 2013 primarily as decreases in outside services and pension costs were mostly offset by increased stockbased compensation expense the increase in stockbased compensation expense was due to increased performancebased achievement levels and the impact of higher share prices on our incentive and deferred compensation plan liabilities which are indexed to our share price 

2012 compared to 2011 

sga costs increased by 270 million or 141 in 2012 despite the impact of foreign currency which decreased sga costs by 46 million consolidated sga costs for 2012 and 2011 were 172 and 160 respectively of consolidated net sales for 2012 and 2011 

packaging systems – packaging systems sga costs increased by 61 million or 55 in 2012 primarily as a result of increased compensation costs mainly related to headcount increases incentive compensation cost increases and incremental costs related to outside services all of which were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency which decreased sga costs by 43 million 

delivery systems –  delivery systems sga costs increased by 14 million or 39 in 2012 primarily as a result of increased compensation costs mainly related to headcount increases and incentive compensation cost increases all of which were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency which decreased sga costs by 03 million 

corporate –  corporates sga costs increased by 195 million or 434 in 2012 primarily due to increases in stockbased compensation expense incentive compensation costs and us pension expense the increase in stockbased compensation expense was primarily due to increased performancebased achievement levels and the impact of higher share prices on our deferred compensation plan liabilities which are indexed to our share price the increase in incentive compensation costs resulted from our current achievement expectations related to our incentive plans in 2012 we also incurred incremental depreciation expense related to new information technology projects as well as incremental depreciation expense and supply and utility costs related to our new corporate office and research building 

restructuring and other items 

the following table presents restructuring charges and other income and expense items for our segments and corporate and other unallocated items 



other income and expense items consisting primarily of foreign exchange transaction gains and losses gains and losses on the sale of fixed assets and miscellaneous income and charges are generally recorded within segment or corporate results certain restructuring impairments and other specificallyidentified gains and losses considered outside of the control of segment management are not allocated to our segments 

during 2013 we recorded development income of 20 million within delivery systems included in this amount was 10 million of income related to a nonrefundable payment of 200 million received from a customer in june 2013 in return for the exclusive use of smartdose within a specific therapeutic area unearned income related to this payment of 15 million and 175 million was included within other current liabilities and other longterm liabilities respectively at december 31 2013 the unearned income is being recognized as development income on a straightline basis over the remaining thirteenyear term of the agreement the agreement does not include a future minimum purchase commitment from the customer 

during 2012 we recorded development income of 65 million within delivery systems primarily attributable to services and the reimbursement of certain costs 

restructuring and related charges   during 2012 we incurred restructuring and related charges of 21 million to complete the 2010 plan charges incurred during 2012 included facility closure costs and employee severance and benefits associated with a reduction in operations at a manufacturing facility in england as well as facility closure costs associated with the 2011 closure of a plant in the us during 2012 we finalized an agreement concerning future manufacturing and supply requirements at our manufacturing facility in england which triggered an impairment review of the related assets our review concluded that the estimated fair value of these assets no longer exceeded their carrying value and therefore an impairment charge of 15 million was recorded we estimated the fair value of the assets using an income approach based on discounted cash flows offsetting the costs incurred during 2012 were reductions to certain previouslyrecorded obligations under the 2010 plan including a reduction of 17 million following the cancellation of the restructuring initiative at one of our plants in europe as a result of increased customer demand for products and related efficiency improvements at that plant we did not incur any restructuring and related charges related to the 2010 plan during 2013 and we do not expect to incur any future charges related to the 2010 plan the remaining restructuring obligations related to the 2010 plan were reduced to zero at december 31 2013 

during 2011 we incurred restructuring and related charges of 53 million associated with the 2010 plan charges associated with the plan in 2011 were primarily associated with the 2011 closure of a plant in the us a reduction of operations at a manufacturing facility in england and the elimination of certain operational and administrative functions in other locations 

impairment charge  – during 2012 as a result of continuing delays and lowerthanexpected demand we updated the sales projections related to one of our delivery systems’ product lines the revised projections triggered an impairment review of the associated assets our review concluded that the estimated fair value of the product line no longer exceeded the carrying value of the related assembly equipment and intangible asset and therefore an impairment charge of 34 million was recorded we estimated the fair value of the asset group using an income approach based on discounted cash flows 

special separation benefits  – during 2011 we incurred 29 million in special separation benefits related to the retirement of our former president and chief operating officer these costs consisted primarily of stockbased compensation expense and a settlement loss related to one of our nonqualified defined benefit pension plans the respective equity compensation arrangements were amended to allow certain of his awards to continue to vest over the original vesting period instead of being forfeited upon separation resulting in a revaluation of the awards and acceleration of expense 

acquisitionrelated contingencies  – during 2013 2012 and 2011 we increased the liability for contingent consideration related to our 2010 acquisition of smartdose technology smartdose contingent consideration by 10 million 12 million and 05 million respectively due to the time value of money and adjustments related to changes in sales projections during 2011 we also reduced the liability for contingent consideration related to our 2009 acquisition of the éris safety syringe system “éris contingent consideration” by 08 million bringing the liability balance to zero this reduction reflects our assessment that none of the contractual operating targets will be achieved over the earnout period which ends in 2014 beginning in 2013 these adjustments are included within delivery systems results

operating profit 

the following table presents operating profit loss by reportable segment corporate and other unallocated costs 



2013 compared to 2012 

consolidated operating profit increased by 273 million or 202 in 2013 including a favorable foreign currency impact of 24 million consolidated operating profit margin increased by 12 margin points in 2013 

packaging systems –  packaging systems’ operating profit increased by 295 million or 157 in 2013 including a favorable foreign exchange impact of 22 million due to the factors described above 

delivery systems –  delivery systems’ operating profit decreased by 90 million or 489 in 2013 despite a favorable foreign exchange impact of 02 million due to the factors described above 

corporate –  corporate costs decreased by 01 million or 02 in 2013 due to the factors described above 

2012 compared to 2011 

consolidated operating profit increased by 255 million or 233 in 2012 despite an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 77 million 

packaging systems –  packaging systems’ operating profit increased by 349 million or 229 in 2012 despite an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 75 million due to the factors described above 

delivery systems –  delivery systems’ operating profit increased by 86 million or 878 in 2012 despite an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 02 million due to the factors described above 

corporate –  corporate costs increased by 193 million or 431 in 2012 due to the factors described above 

loss on debt extinguishment 

during the year ended december 31 2013 we repurchased 25 million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible debentures resulting in a pretax loss on debt extinguishment of 02 million the majority of which consisted of the premium over par value during the year ended december 31 2012 we recognized a pretax loss on debt extinguishment of 116 million related to our repurchase of 1584 million of our convertible debentures which consisted of a 62 million premium over par value 44 million writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs and 10 million in transaction costs 

interest expense net 

the following table presents interest expense net by significant component 



2013 compared to 2012 

interest expense net increased by 02 million or 13 in 2013 primarily due to a decrease in capitalized interest as less capital projects were in progress in 2013 as compared to 2012 interest expense was constant at 186 million for both 2013 and 2012 as the impact of the higher interest rate associated with the fiveyear team loan that we entered into in 2013 for our new corporate office and research building was offset by the impact of less debt outstanding during 2013 

2012 compared to 2011 

interest expense net decreased by 20 million or 118 in 2012 primarily due to increased capitalized interest resulting from recentlycompleted or ongoing capital projects as well as the impact of the retirement at maturity of our 500 million series a floating rate notes and the expiration of the related interest rate swap agreement which we financed under our lowerrate senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility agreement the new credit agreement see note 10 debt  for further discussion of the new credit agreement 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes was 402 million 327 million and 235 million for the years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively resulting in effective tax rates of 274 302 and 253 respectively 

the decrease in the effective tax rate for 2013 and the increase in the effective tax rate for 2012 reflects the nondeductibility of the purchase premium paid during 2012 related to the extinguishment of our convertible debt and the impact of the discrete tax items discussed below the increase in the effective tax rate for 2012 also reflects changes in our geographic mix of earnings and the absence of the research and development tax credit in 2012 as the tax credit expired in 2011 and was not reinstated until the enactment of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 the “act” in january 2013 in accordance with us gaap although the act retroactively reinstated the tax credit for two years from january 1 2012 through december 31 2013 it was not taken into account for financial reporting purposes until 2013 had the act been signed prior to january 2013 our effective tax rate for 2012 would have been reduced by approximately 10 

during 2013 we recorded a discrete tax charge of 35 million which related to the finalization of a beneficial agreement with local tax authorities in israel that clarified the future tax status of our entities in israel and settled a tax audit for the years 2009 through 2011 during 2013 we also recorded a discrete tax charge of 13 million resulting from the impact of a change in the enacted tax rate in the united kingdom on our previouslyrecorded deferred tax asset balances and a discrete tax benefit of 13 million related to the reinstatement of the research and development tax credit in january 2013 

during 2012 as a result of the finalization of estimates of foreign tax credits available with respect to a dividend from one of our foreign subsidiaries we recorded a discrete tax charge of 10 million we also recorded a discrete tax charge of 08 million resulting from the impact of a change in the enacted tax rate in the united kingdom on our previouslyrecorded deferred tax balances and recorded a discrete tax charge of 03 million reduction of our deferred tax assets associated with the legal restructuring of the ownership of our puerto rico operations 

during 2011 we recorded 14 million in net discrete tax charges from changes in international tax rates that affected our deferred tax carrying values 

as of december 31 2013 we had 71 million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits of which 69 million if recognized would favorably impact the effective income tax rate it is reasonably possible that due to the expiration of statutes and the closing of tax audits the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced by approximately 04 million during the next twelve months which would favorably impact our effective tax rate 

equity in net income of affiliated companies 

equity in net income of affiliated companies represents the contribution to earnings from our 25 ownership interest in daikyo and our 49 ownership interest in four companies in mexico equity in net income of affiliated companies was 54 million 48 million and 63 million for the years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively equity in net income of affiliated companies increased by 06 million or 125 in 2013 primarily due to favorable operating results in mexico equity in net income of affiliated companies decreased by 15 million or 238 in 2012 primarily due to startup costs for a new production facility and increased sga costs at daikyo 

purchases from and royalty payments made to affiliates totaled 677 million in 2013 752 million in 2012 and 664 million in 2011 the majority of which related to a distributorship agreement with daikyo that allows us to purchase and resell daikyo products sales to affiliates were 59 million 35 million and 45 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

net income 

net income in 2013 was 1123 million or 157 per diluted share compared to 807 million or 115 per diluted share in 2012 our 2013 results included the impact of a loss on extinguishment of debt of 02 million and net discrete tax charges of 36 million 

net income in 2012 was 807 million or 115 per diluted share compared to 755 million or 108 per diluted share in 2011 our 2012 results included the impact of restructuring and related charges of 14 million net of 07 million in tax an impairment charge of 21 million net of 13 million in tax an increase in acquisitionrelated contingencies of 10 million net of 02 million in tax a loss on extinguishment of debt of 98 million net of 18 million in tax and discrete tax charges of 21 million 

net income in 2011 was 755 million or 108 per diluted share compared to 653 million or 095 per diluted share in 2010 our 2011 results included the impact of restructuring and related charges of 35 million net of 18 million in tax income from the reduction of acquisitionrelated contingencies of 02 million special separation benefits related to the retirement of our former president and chief operating officer of 18 million net of 11 million in tax and net discrete tax charges of 14 million

cash flows 

the following table presents cash flow data for the years ended december 31  



net cash provided by operating activities 

2013 compared to 2012   

net cash provided by operating activities was 2205 million in 2013 an increase of 331 million from 2012 net cash provided by operating activities increased in 2013 primarily due to the increase in net income and our receipt of a nonrefundable payment of 200 million from a customer in delivery systems related to exclusivity during 2013 both of which were partially offset by higher working capital requirements and the timing of other payments 

2012 compared to 2011 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1874 million in 2012 an increase of 567 million from 2011 net cash provided by operating activities increased in 2012 primarily due to the net sales and gross profit improvements achieved in both packaging systems and delivery systems lower restructuring payments the collection of deposits and the timing of other payments

2013 compared to 2012   

net cash used in investing activities was 1499 million in 2013 an increase of 339 million from 2012 net cash used in investing activities increased in 2013 primarily due to a 206 million increase in capital spending to 1519 million in 2013 the majority of the increased capital spending was related to construction of our new corporate office and research building which began in 2011 and settled in february 2013 construction of our new rubber and metal manufacturing facility in india and various capital projects related to new products expansion activity and emerging markets net cash used in investing activities also increased in 2013 due to the change in our shortterm investment activity during 2013 we sold 191 million and purchased 142 million of shortterm investments during 2012 we sold 456 million and purchased 312 million of shortterm investments the shortterm investments represent certificates of deposit primarily in israel with maturities between ninetyone days and one year at the time of purchase 

2012 compared to 2011   

net cash used in investing activities was 1160 million in 2012 a decrease of 45 million from 2011 net cash used in investing activities decreased in 2012 primarily due to a 400 million net change in shortterm investments as we had net sales of shortterm investments of 144 million in 2012 as compared to net purchases of shortterm investments of 256 million in 2011 the shortterm investments represent certificates of deposit primarily in israel with maturities between ninetyone days and one year at the time of purchase the change related to shortterm investments was partially offset by a 359 million increase in capital spending to 1313 million in 2012 the majority of the increased capital spending was related to construction of our new corporate office and research building which began in 2011 and settled in february 2013 information technology infrastructure improvements and construction of our compressionmolding plant in china 

net cash used in financing activities 

2013 compared to 2012 

net cash used in financing activities was 51 million in 2013 an increase of 17 million from 2012 net cash used in financing activities for 2013 increased primarily due to a reduction in our net debt activity partially offset by a 130 million increase in proceeds from exercises of stock options and stock appreciation rights as compared to 2012 during 2013 upon settlement of our new corporate office and research building we borrowed 428 million under a revolving credit facility which was immediately converted to a fiveyear term loan due january 2018 a portion of the loan was used to pay the 353 million in outstanding obligations at december 31 2012 related to the construction and acquisition of the new building during 2013 we also entered into eurodenominated debt under our multicurrency revolving credit facility and used a portion of our multicurrency revolving credit facility to repay our euro note a that matured on february 27 2013 during 2013 we also repurchased 25 million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible debentures during 2012 we used our multicurrency revolving credit facility to fund our repurchase of 1584 million of our convertible debentures and we incurred debt issuance costs of 75 million which primarily consisted of the settlement payment made by us for two treasury lock agreements that we entered into and subsequently terminated we used cash generated from operations and net borrowings to fund the repurchase of our convertible debentures working capital needs capital expenditures and to pay dividends 

we paid cash dividends totaling 268 million 0385 per share and 249 million 0365 per share during 2013 and 2012 respectively

net cash used in financing activities for 2012 included an overall increase in net revolving credit facility borrowings from 2011 and debt issuance costs of 75 million which primarily consisted of the settlement payment made by us for the two forward treasury lock agreements that we entered into and subsequently terminated during 2012 see note 11 derivative financial instruments  and note 10 debt  for further discussion we used cash generated from operations and net borrowings to fund our repurchase of our convertible debentures working capital needs capital expenditures and pension obligations and to pay dividends 

we paid cash dividends totaling 249 million 0365 per share and 232 million 0345 per share during 2012 and 2011 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

the table below presents selected liquidity and capital measures as of 



cash and cash equivalents include all instruments that have maturities of ninety days or less when purchased shortterm investments include all instruments that have maturities between ninetyone days and one year at the time of purchase working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents and total invested capital is defined as the sum of net debt and total equity 

cash and cash equivalents –  our cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2013 consisted of cash held in cash depository accounts with banks around the world and cash invested in highquality shortterm investments the cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2013 included 161 million of cash held by subsidiaries within the us and 2139 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the us primarily in germany israel and singapore which is available to fund operations and growth of nonus subsidiaries repatriating the cash into the us could trigger us federal state and local income tax obligations however we may temporarily access cash held by our nonus subsidiaries without becoming subject to us income tax by entering into shortterm intercompany loans 

working capital   working capital at december 31 2013 increased by 1183 million or 400 during 2013 as compared to 2012 including an increase of 31 million due to foreign currency translation excluding the impact of currency exchange rates cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and inventories increased by 655 million 91 million and 139 million respectively and total current liabilities decreased by 264 million accounts receivable and inventories increased primarily due to increased sales activity related turnover measurements for each were consistent between december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 the decrease in current liabilities was primarily due to our repayment of our euro note a which we refinanced using a portion of our multicurrency revolving credit facility 

debt and credit facilities   the 380 million decrease in total debt at december 31 2013 as compared to december 31 2012 resulted from net repayments and related debt activity of 415 million partially offset by foreign currency rate fluctuations of 35 million 

our sources of liquidity include our multicurrency revolving credit facility which expires in april 2017 and contains a 3000 million committed credit facility and an accordion feature allowing the maximum to be increased through a term loan to 3500 million upon approval by the banks borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to onemonth london interbank offering rates libor plus a margin ranging from 125 to 225 percentage points which is based on the ratio of our senior debt to modified ebitda during 2013 we entered into eurodenominated debt under our multicurrency revolving credit facility and used a portion of our multicurrency revolving credit facility to repay our euro note a that matured on february 27 2013 at december 31 2013 we had 537 million in outstanding longterm borrowings under this facility of which 48 million was denominated in yen 289 million in euros and the remainder in us dollars these borrowings together with outstanding letters of credit of 35 million resulted in a borrowing capacity available under this facility of 2428 million at december 31 2013 we do not expect any significant limitations on our ability to access this source of funds 

in addition in february 2013 upon settlement of our new corporate office and research building we borrowed 428 million under a separate revolving credit facility which was immediately converted to a fiveyear term loan due january 2018 a portion of the loan was used to pay the 353 million in outstanding obligations at december 31 2012 related to the construction and acquisition of the new building borrowings under the loan bear interest at a variable rate equal to onemonth libor plus a margin of 150 percentage points at december 31 2013 413 million was outstanding under this loan of which 20 million was classified as current 

during 2013 we repurchased 25 million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible debentures resulting in a pretax loss on debt extinguishment of 02 million the majority of which consisted of the premium over par value following the repurchase 06 million principal amount of convertible debentures remains outstanding 

pursuant to the financial covenants in our debt agreements we are required to maintain established interest coverage ratios and to not exceed established leverage ratios in addition the agreements contain other customary covenants none of which we consider restrictive to our operations at december 31 2013 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements throughout 2014 

we believe that cash on hand and cash generated from operations together with availability under our multicurrency revolving credit facility will be adequate to address our foreseeable liquidity needs based on our current expectations of our business operations capital expenditures and scheduled payments of debt obligations 

commitments and contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments at december 31 2013 these obligations are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity 



 35 

 

 

 

reserves for uncertain tax positions   the table above does not include 71 million  of total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2013  due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for amounts which may be paid 

letters of credit   we have letters of credit totaling 35 million  supporting the reimbursement of workers compensation and other claims paid on our behalf by insurance carriers the accrual for insurance obligations was 85 million  at december 31 2013  of which 47 million  is in excess of our deductible and therefore is reimbursable by the insurance company 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2013 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases unconditional purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business and outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

managements discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with us gaap the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions some of which are subjective and complex that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our results of operations and financial position 

revenue recognition  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists title and risk of loss have transferred the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured generally sales are recognized upon shipment or upon delivery to our customers site based upon shipping terms or legal requirements some customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes we record rebate costs when sales occur based on our assessment of the likelihood that the required volumes will be attained we also maintain an allowance for product returns as we believe that we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of returns based on our substantial historical experience 

impairment of longlived assets longlived assets including property plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable an asset is considered impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future expected undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset once an asset is considered impaired an impairment loss is recorded within restructuring and other items for the difference between the assets carrying value and its fair value for assets held and used in the business management determines fair value using estimated future cash flows to be derived from the asset discounted to a net present value using an appropriate discount rate for assets held for sale or for investment 

purposes management determines fair value by estimating the proceeds to be received upon sale of the asset less disposition costs 

during 2012 as a result of continuing delays and lowerthanexpected demand we updated the sales projections related to one of our delivery systems product lines the revised projections triggered an impairment review of the associated assets our review concluded that the estimated fair value of the product line no longer exceeded the carrying value of the related assembly equipment and intangible asset and therefore an impairment charge of 34 million was recorded 32 million of which was for the related assembly equipment we estimated the fair value of the asset group using an income approach based on discounted cash flows 

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually following the completion of our annual budget and longrange planning process or whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level which is the same as or one level below our operating segments recent accounting guidance allows entities to first assess qualitative factors including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors and overall financial performance to determine whether it is necessary to perform the first step of the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test we considered this guidance when performing our annual impairment testing but elected to continue utilizing the twostep quantitative impairment test the first step in the twostep test is to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill if the carrying amount exceeds fair value the second step must be performed the second step requires the comparison of the carrying amount of the goodwill to its implied fair value which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired as of the testing date any excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the implied fair value would represent an impairment loss considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test such as future sales future cash flows and longterm growth rates are consistent with internal projections and operating plans amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test are also largely dependent on the continued sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products as well as our timeliness and success in newproduct innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems changes in the estimate of fair value including the estimate of future cash flows could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position no impairment in the carrying value of our reporting units was evident as a result of our annual review of goodwill with the exception of our delivery systems europe reporting unit which had a fair value in excess of its carrying value of 25 and which is largely dependent on the continued and anticipated demand for certain of its contract manufacturing and proprietary safety systems products each of our reporting units whose assets included goodwill had a fair value in excess of its respective carrying value of at least 35 at december 31 2013 the goodwill associated with the delivery systems europe reporting unit equaled 103 million or 90 of our total goodwill 

certain trademarks and inprocess rd have been determined to have indefinite lives and therefore are not subject to amortization similar to the impairment testing for goodwill there is an option to first assess qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test we considered this option when performing our impairment testing but elected to continue utilizing a quantitative test comparing the fair value and carrying value of the asset any excess carrying value would represent an impairment loss fair values are determined using discounted cash flow analyses 

intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 

as discussed above during 2012 an impairment charge of 34 million was recorded as the estimated fair value of one of our delivery systems product lines no longer exceeded the carrying value of the related assembly equipment and intangible asset the impairment charge for the intangible asset was 02 million see above for further discussion 

employee benefits  we maintain funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans in the us and a number of other countries that cover employees that meet eligibility requirements in addition we sponsor postretirement benefit plans which provide healthcare benefits for eligible employees who retire or become disabled the measurement of annual cost and obligations under these defined benefit postretirement plans is subject to a number of assumptions which are specific for each of our us and foreign plans the assumptions which are reviewed at least annually are relevant to both the plan assets where applicable and the obligation for benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees two of the most critical assumptions in determining pension and retiree medical plan expense are the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement age rates of compensation increases mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience for our funded plans we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our plan assets as well as historical and expected rates of return in estimating the longterm rate of return on plan assets under us gaap differences between actual and expected results are generally accumulated in other comprehensive income loss as actuarial gains or losses and subsequently amortized into earnings over future periods 

changes in key assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position we estimate that every 25 basis point reduction in our longterm rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by 06 million and every 25 basis point reduction in our discount rate would increase pension expense by 05 million a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations our net pension underfunded balance at december 31 2013 was 761 million compared to 1122 million at december 31 2012 our underfunded balance for other postretirement benefits was 91 million at december 31 2013 compared to 260 million at december 31 2012 

income taxes  we estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation in addition deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established to recognize differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities we maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized the recoverability of tax assets is subject to our estimates of future profitability generally at the respective subsidiary company and country level changes in tax legislation business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined 

when accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements we apply a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 

contingent consideration 

the fair value of the smartdose contingent consideration was determined at the acquisition date using a probabilityweighted income approach and is revalued at each reporting date or more frequently if circumstances dictate changes in the fair value of this obligation are recorded as income or expense within restructuring and other items in our consolidated statements of income the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our contingent consideration are the sales projections the probability of success factors and the discount rate used in the calculation significant increases or decreases in any of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement as development and commercialization of smartdose progresses we may need to update the sales projections the probability of success factors and the discount rate used this could result in a material increase or decrease to the contingent consideration liability 

see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 16 new accounting standards  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on accounting and reporting standards considered in the preparation and presentation of our financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risk factors such as fluctuating interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and increasing commodity prices these risk factors can impact our results of operations cash flows and financial position to manage these risks we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps call options and forward exchange contracts for periods consistent with and for notional amounts equal to or less than the underlying exposures in accordance with company policy derivative financial instruments are not used for speculation or trading purposes 

foreign currency exchange risk 

sales outside of the us accounted for 55 of consolidated net sales in 2013 virtually all of these sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into us dollars for consolidated reporting purposes although the majority of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary they may also hold assets or liabilities denominated in other currencies these items may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains and losses as a result our results of operations and financial position are exposed to changing currency exchange rates we periodically use forward contracts to hedge certain transactions or to neutralize monthend balance sheet exposures on crosscurrency intercompany loans 

we have designated our €611 million euro note b and our €210 million eurodenominated borrowings under our revolving credit facility as a hedge of our net investment in certain european subsidiaries we also have 5000 million in yendenominated borrowings under our revolving credit facility which has been designated as a hedge of our net investment in daikyo at december 31 2013 a net cumulative foreign currency translation loss on these hedges of 31 million net of tax of 19 million was recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss 

interest rate risk    

as a result of our normal borrowing activities we have longterm debt with both fixed and variable interest rates longterm debt consists of senior notes convertible debentures revolving credit facilities and capital lease obligations our exposures to fluctuations in interest rates are managed to the extent considered necessary by entering into interest rate swap agreements 

the following table summarizes our interest rate risksensitive instruments 



1 as of december 31 2013  we have two interest rate swap agreements outstanding the first agreement is designed to protect against volatility in variable interest rates payable on our 250 million senior floating rate notes maturing july 28 2015 “series b notes” the second is a forwardstart interest rate swap designed to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the applicable interest rate of our 413 million fiveyear term loan at december 31 2013  these agreements had a fair value of 56 million unfavorable to the company which was recorded as a noncurrent liability refer to note 11 derivative financial instruments  for additional information on these interest rate hedges 

commodity price risk 

many of our packaging systems products are made from synthetic elastomers which are derived from the petroleum refining process we purchase the majority of our elastomers via longterm supply contracts some of which contain clauses that provide for surcharges related to fluctuations in crude oil prices in recent years increases in raw material costs have had an adverse impact on us we expect the volatility in raw material prices to continue we will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects on gross profit 

in february 2013 we purchased a series of call options intended to mitigate our exposure to such oilbased surcharges and protect operating cash flows with regard to a portion of our forecasted elastomer purchases during the months of july through december 2013 by capping our cost of the crude oil component of elastomer prices this allows us to limit our exposure to increasing petroleum prices these call options were not designated as hedging instruments as of december 31 2013 there were no options outstanding

business segments 

our business operations are organized into two reportable segments which are aligned with the underlying markets and customers they serve our reportable segments are the pharmaceutical packaging systems segment “packaging systems” and the pharmaceutical delivery systems segment “delivery systems” 

packaging systems segment 

our packaging systems segment develops manufactures and sells primary packaging components and systems for injectable drug delivery including stoppers and seals for vials closures and other components used in syringe intravenous and blood collection systems and prefillable syringe components the growth strategy for packaging systems includes organic growth through market segmentation newproduct innovation strategic acquisitions and geographic expansion we have manufacturing facilities in north and south america europe and asia with affiliated companies in mexico and japan see item 2 properties    for additional information on our manufacturing and other sites 

packaging systems consists of three operating segments  americas europe and asia pacific  which are aggregated for reporting purposes 

packaging systems products generally consist of elastomeric components offered in a variety of standard and customerspecific configurations and formulations which are available with advanced barrier films and coatings to enhance their performance west flurotec barrier film is applied using a patented molding process to reduce the risk of product loss by contamination and protect the shelf life of packaged drugs we also apply a teflon coating to the surface of stoppers and plungers to improve compatibility between the closure and the drug b2coating is a coating applied to the surface of stoppers and plungers using a patented process that eliminates the need for conventional silicone application it helps manufacturers reduce product rejections due to trace levels of silicone molecules found in noncoated packaged drug compounds flurotec and b2coating technologies are licensed from daikyo seiko ltd 

in addition our westar® rs and westar ru postmanufacturing processes are documented and fully validated procedures for washing and siliconizing stoppers and syringe components to remove biological materials and endotoxins the westar rs process prepares components for introduction into the customers sterilizer and the westar ru process provides sterilized components these processes increase the overall efficiency of injectable drug production by outsourcing component processing thereby eliminating steps otherwise required in each of our customers manufacturing processes and help to assure compliance with the latest regulatory requirements for component preparation we also offer envision™ components that are inspected using automated vision inspection systems ensuring that components plungers and stoppers meet enhanced quality specifications for visible and subvisible particulate and contamination 

our recentlyintroduced novapure ®  components which include serum and lyophilization stoppers and syringe plungers incorporate quality by design principles and are manufactured utilizing advanced process technologies the closures provide the highest levels of quality to the market helping to ensure the safety efficacy and purity of injectable drug products 

our tamperevident flipoff® seals are sold in a wide range of sizes and colors to meet customers needs for product identification and differentiation the seals can be provided using proprietary printing for cautionary statements and embossing technology that can serve as a counterfeiting deterrence 

as an adjunct to our packaging systems products we offer contract analytical laboratory services for testing and evaluating primary drugpackaging components and their compatibility with the contained drug formulation west analytical services provides us and our customers with indepth knowledge and analysis of the interaction and compatibility of drug products with elastomer glass and plastic packaging components our analytical laboratories also provide specialized testing for complete drug delivery systems 

see note 5 segment information  for net sales information for packaging systems 

delivery systems segment 

our delivery systems segment develops manufactures and sells safety and administration systems multicomponent systems for drug administration and a variety of custom contractmanufacturing solutions targeted to the healthcare and consumerproducts industries delivery systems has expertise in product design and development including inhouse mold design and construction an engineering center for developmental and prototype tooling process design and validation and highspeed automated assemblies in addition delivery systems is responsible for the continued development and commercialization of our line of proprietary healthcare administrative and advanced injection systems including daikyo cz smartdose® and other systems delivery systems has manufacturing operations in north america and europe see item 2 properties  for additional information on our manufacturing and other sites 

delivery systems offers a variety of products and services which are described below 

we offer customer contractmanufacturing and assembly solutions which use such technologies as multicomponent molding inmold labeling ultrasonic welding and clean room molding and device assembly used to manufacture customerowned components and devices used in surgical diagnostic ophthalmic other drug delivery systems personal care and consumer products 

our administration systems include sterile devices for the administration of drug products including patented products such as the mixject tm  transfer device the mix2vial tm  needleless reconstitution system and vial adapters 

examples of our safety systems that are designed to prevent needle sticks are éris tm  and bsafe® for prefilled syringes and novaguard tm  for luer lock syringes 

the daikyo cz 1ml long insert needle syringe system is the markets first syringe system without silicone oil lubrication applied to the barrel or plunger and that incorporates an insertmolded needle to avoid the need for adhesive the luer lock version of the daikyo cz syringe system was introduced previously along with several sizes of sterile vials additional sizes of vials continue to be introduced cz technology is licensed from daikyo seiko ltd 

our smartdose electronic patch injector system was introduced during 2010 and is under evaluation by many biopharmaceutical companies this system is designed for controlled subcutaneous delivery of high volume and high viscosity drugs using prefilled daikyo cz cartridges the system is fully programmable has a single pushbutton operation and a hidden needle for safety 

the confidose® and selfdose tm  autoinjector systems enhance patient compliance and safety the needle remains shielded at all times and retracts automatically after the injection these systems eliminate preparation steps and automate the injection of drugs providing patients with a sterile singleuse disposable system that can be readily used at home 

see note 5 segment information  for net sales information for delivery systems 

restructuring initiatives 

in december 2010 our board of directors approved a restructuring plan the 2010 plan designed to reduce our cost structure and improve operating efficiency the plan involved the 2011 closure of a plant in the united states a reduction in operations at a manufacturing facility in england and the elimination of certain operational and administrative functions in other locations under this plan we incurred total restructuring and related charges of 219 million including 21 million in 2012 we do not expect to incur any future charges related to the 2010 plan and the remaining restructuring obligations at december 31 2012 will be reduced to zero as payments are made 

see note 3 restructuring and other items  for further discussion 

international 

we have significant operations outside of the united states they are managed through the same business segments as our us operations – packaging systems and delivery systems sales outside of the united states account for 53 of consolidated net sales for a geographic breakdown of sales see note 5 segment information  

although the general business processes are similar to the domestic business international operations are exposed to additional risks these risks include currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar multiple tax jurisdictions and particularly in south america and israel political and social issues that could destabilize local markets and affect the demand for our products 

see further discussion of our international operations the risks associated with our international operations and our attempt to minimize some of these risks in part i item 1a risk factors  part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resources part ii item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  note 1   under the captions financial instruments  and foreign currency translation and note 12 derivative financial instruments  

raw materials 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers aluminum and plastic elastomers include both natural and synthetic materials we have access to adequate supplies of these raw materials to meet our production needs through agreements with suppliers 

we employ a supplychain management strategy in our business segments which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply due to regulatory control over our production processes and the cost and time involved in qualifying suppliers we rely on singlesource suppliers for many critical raw materials this strategy increases the risk that our supply chain may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production problem these risks are managed where possible by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites rigid quality control systems surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in case of an interruption in production 

intellectual property rights 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business we own or license numerous patents and have patent applications pending in the united states and in other countries that relate to various aspects of our products in addition key valueadded and proprietary products and processes are licensed from daikyo seiko ltd our patents and other proprietary rights have been useful in establishing our market share and in the growth of our business and are expected to continue to be of value in the future as we continue to develop proprietary products although important in the aggregate we do not consider our business to be materially dependent on any individual patent or license 

we also rely on trade secrets manufacturing knowhow and continuing technological innovations as well as inlicensing opportunities to maintain and further develop our competitive position particularly in the area of formulation development and tooling design 

seasonality 

although our packaging systems business is not inherently seasonal sales and operating profit in the second half of the year are typically lower than the first half primarily due to scheduled plant shutdowns in conjunction with our customers production schedules and the yearend impact of holidays on production 

working capital 

we are required to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet customer requirements in addition some of our supply agreements require us to purchase inventory in bulk orders which increases inventory levels but decreases the risk of supply interruption levels of inventory are also influenced by the seasonal patterns addressed above for a more detailed discussion of working capital please see the discussion in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resource s 

marketing 

our packaging systems customers include practically every major branded pharmaceutical generic and biopharmaceutical company in the world packaging systems components and other products are sold to major pharmaceutical biotechnology and hospital supplymedical device companies which incorporate them into their products for distribution to the ultimate enduser 

our delivery systems segment sells to many of the worlds largest pharmaceutical biopharmaceutical and medical device companies and to large customers within the personal care and foodandbeverage industries delivery systems components generally are incorporated into our customers manufacturing lines for further processing or assembly 

our products and services are distributed primarily through our own sales force and distribution network with limited use of contract sales agents and regional distributors 

our ten largest customers accounted for 404 of our consolidated net sales in 2012 but none of these customers individually accounted for more than 10 of net sales 

order backlog 

at december 31 2012 our order backlog was 3540 million all of which is expected to be filled during 2013 the order backlog was 2898 million at the end of 2011 the increase is primarily due to a lengthening of the average leadtime for sales orders as well as sales growth for higher value products order backlog includes firm orders placed by customers for manufacture over a period of time according to their schedule or upon confirmation by the customer we also have contractual arrangements with a number of our customers products covered by these contracts are included in our backlog only as orders are received 

competition 

we compete with several companies across our packaging systems product lines however we believe that we supply a major portion of the us market for pharmaceutical elastomer and metal packaging components and also have a significant share of the european market for these components because of the special nature of our pharmaceutical packaging components and our longstanding participation in the market competition is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive costcontrol programs across their operations 

we differentiate ourselves from our competition as a fullservice valueadded global supplier that can provide presale formula and engineering development analytical services regulatory expertise and postmanufacturing technologies as well as aftersale technical support customers also appreciate the global scope of wests manufacturing capability and our ability to produce many products at multiple sites 

our delivery systems business competes in very competitive markets for both healthcare and consumer products the markets we serve are also served by many competitors and therefore our market shares are generally less than 5 of the total global markets the competition varies from smaller regional companies to large global molders that command significant market shares there are extreme cost pressures and many of our customers look offshore to reduce cost we differentiate ourselves by leveraging our global capability and by employing new technologies such as highspeed automated assembly insertmolding multishot molding and expertise with multiplepiece closure systems 

because of the more demanding regulatory requirements in the medical device component area there are a smaller number of competitors mostly largescale companies we compete for this market on the basis of our reputation for quality and reliability in engineering and project management diverse contract manufacturing capabilities and knowledge of and experience in complying with fda requirements with our range of proprietary technologies we compete with new and established companies in the area of drug delivery devices including suppliers of prefillable syringes autoinjectors safety needles and other proprietary systems 

research and development activities 

we maintain our own researchscale production facilities and laboratories for developing new products and offer contract engineering design and development services to assist customers with new product development our quality control regulatory and laboratory testing capabilities are used to ensure compliance with applicable manufacturing and regulatory standards for primary and secondary pharmaceutical packaging components the engineering departments are responsible for product and tooling design and testing and for the design and construction of processing equipment we continue to seek new innovative opportunities for acquisition licensing partnering or development within injectable packaging and delivery systems most of which will be manufactured and marketed by our delivery systems segment research and development spending will continue to increase as we pursue innovative strategic platforms in prefillable syringe injectable container advanced injection and safety and administration systems 

commercial development of our new products and services for medical and pharmaceutical applications commonly requires several years new products that we develop may require separate approval as medical devices and products that are intended to be used in packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical products will be subject to both customer acceptance of our products and regulatory approval of the customers products following our development period 

we spent 127 million in 2012 116 million in 2011 and 98 million in 2010 on research and development for the packaging systems segment the delivery systems segment incurred research and development costs of 205 million 175 million and 141 million in the years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2012 and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes in 2013 

employees 

as of december 31 2012 we employed approximately 6700 people in our operations throughout the world 




 item 1a risk factors 

the statements in this section describe major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this form 10k contains some forwardlooking statements that are based on managements beliefs and assumptions current expectations estimates and forecasts we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forwardlooking statements such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts we have attempted wherever possible to identify forwardlooking statements by using words such as “estimate” “expect” “intend” “believe” “plan” “anticipate” and other words and terms of similar meaning in particular these include statements relating to future actions business plans and prospects new products future performance or results of current or anticipated products sales efforts expenses interest rates foreignexchange rates economic effects the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results 

many of the factors that will determine our future results are beyond our ability to control or predict achievement of future results is subject to known or unknown risks or uncertainties and therefore actual results could differ materially from past results and those expressed or implied in any forwardlooking statement you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements 

unless required by applicable securities law we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise we also refer you to further disclosures we make on related subjects in our quarterly reports on form 10q and 8k reports to the sec 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 

the current uncertainty in the global economy including the continuing effects of recession or slow economic growth in the united states and europe may negatively affect our operating results examples of the effects of these continuing global economic challenges include our suppliers and our customers inability to access the credit markets at commercially reasonable rates reduction in sales due to customers decreasing their inventories in the nearterm or longterm or due to liquidity difficulties reduction in sales due to shortages of materials we purchase from our suppliers reduction in research and development efforts and expenditures by our customers our inability to hedge our currency and raw material risks sufficiently or at commercially reasonable prices insolvency of suppliers or customers inflationary pressures on our supplies or our products and increased expenses due to growing taxation of corporate profits or revenues our operating results in one or more geographic regions may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region if economic and market conditions in the united states or europe weaken further we may experience material adverse impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our sales and profitability are largely dependent on the sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products if the products developed by our customers in the future use another delivery system our sales and profitability could suffer 

our business depends to a substantial extent on customers continued sales and development of products that are delivered by injection if our customers fail to continue to sell develop and deploy new injectable products or we are unable to develop new products that assist in the delivery of drugs by alternative methods our sales and profitability may suffer 

if we are unable to provide comparative value advantages timely fulfillment of customer orders or resist pricing pressure we will have to reduce our prices which may reduce our profit margins 

we compete with several companies across our major product lines because of the special nature of these products competition is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive cost control programs across their entire operations competitors often compete on the basis of price we differentiate ourselves from our competition as a fullservice valueadded supplier that is able to provide presale compatibility studies and other services and sophisticated postsale technical support on a global basis however we face continued pricing pressure from our customers and competitors if we are unable to resist or to offset the effects of continued pricing pressure through our valueadded services improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures or if we have to reduce our prices our sales and profitability may suffer 

consolidation in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries have experienced a significant amount of consolidation as a result of this consolidation competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased in addition group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has placed pricing pressure on suppliers further consolidation within the industries we serve could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products 

we are subject to regulation by governments around the world and if these regulations are not complied with existing and future operations may be curtailed and we could be subject to liability 

the design development manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our products and our customers products that incorporate our products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the united states europe and other countries including the fda and the european medicines agency complying with governmental regulation can be costly and can result in required modification or withdrawal of existing products and a substantial delay in the introduction of new products failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or failure to obtain regulatory approval for a new product could result in expenses and actions that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

products incorporating our technologies are subject to regulations and extensive approval or clearance processes which make the timing and success of newproduct commercialization difficult to predict 

the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is expensive and timeconsuming historically most medical devices incorporating our technologies have been subject to the fdas 510k marketing approval process which typically lasts from six to nine months supplemental or full premarket approval reviews require a significantly longer period delaying commercialization pharmaceutical products incorporating our technologies are subject to the fdas new drug application process which typically takes a number of years to complete   additionally biotechnology products incorporating our technologies are subject to the fdas biologics license application process which also typically takes a number of years to complete outside of the united states sales of medical devices and pharmaceutical or biotechnology products are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary from country to country the time required to obtain approval for sale internationally may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 

changes in the regulation of drug products and devices may increase competitive pressure and adversely affect our business 

an effect of the governmental regulation of our customers drug products devices and manufacturing processes is that compliance with regulations makes it costly and timeconsuming for customers to substitute or replace components and devices produced by one supplier with those from another the regulation of our customers products that incorporate our components and devices has increased over time if the applicable regulations were to be modified in a way that reduced the cost and time involved for customers to substitute one suppliers components or devices for those made by another it is likely that the competitive pressure would increase and adversely affect our sales and profitability 

if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights we may harm our ability to compete 

our patents trademarks and other intellectual property are important to our business we rely on patent trademark copyright trade secret and other intellectual property laws as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary information technologies and process we also have obligations with respect to the nonuse and nondisclosure of third party intellectual property we may need to engage in litigation or similar activities to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others any such litigation could require us to expend significant resources and divert the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel from our business operations we cannot assure you that the steps we will take to prevent misappropriation infringement or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of others will be successful in addition effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for some of our trademarks and patents in some countries failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business and results of operations in addition we may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar or duplicative to ours 

disruption in our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make and sell products and have a negative impact on our reputation performance or financial condition 

we have manufacturing sites all over the world in addition in some instances the manufacturing of certain product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants the functioning of our manufacturing and distribution assets and systems could be disrupted for reasons either within or beyond our control including extreme weather or longerterm climatic changes natural disasters pandemic war accidental damage disruption to the supply of material or services product quality and safety issues systems failure workforce actions or environmental contamination there is a risk that incident management systems in place may prove inadequate and that any disruption may materially adversely affect our ability to make and sell products and therefore materially adversely affect our reputation performance or financial condition 

the medical technology industry is very competitive and new products may replace our products or cause a reduction in demand 

the medical technology industry is subject to rapid technological changes and we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold we face this competition from a wide range of companies these include large medical device companies some of which have greater financial and marketing resources than we do we also face competition from firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets in some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for diseases that may be delivered without a medical device the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology may render some of our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive 

risks associated with foreign operations including changes in importexport duties political or economic climates or exchange rates may adversely affect our business 

we conduct business in most of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world virtually all of the international sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into us dollars which can result in significant fluctuations in the amount of those sales or earnings the exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future in addition to translation risks we incur currency transaction gains or losses when we or one of our subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction in a currency other than that entitys local currency the main currencies to which we are exposed besides the us dollar are the euro british pound danish krone singapore dollar and japanese yen in order to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in certain exchange rates we have entered and expect to enter into hedging arrangements including the use of financial derivatives there can be no certainty that we will be able to enter into or maintain effective hedges of currency risks which could have a significant effect on our financial condition and operating results 

our international operations are also exposed to the following risks transportation delays and interruptions political and economic instability and disruptions imposition of duties and tariffs import and export controls the risks of divergent business expectations or cultural incompatibility inherent in establishing and maintaining operations in foreign countries difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations labor strikes andor disputes and potentially adverse tax consequences limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies with third parties or our joint venture partners outside of the united states could also create exposure in addition we may not be able to operate in compliance with foreign laws and regulations or comply with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject in the event that these laws or regulations change any of these events could have an adverse effect on our international operations in the future by reducing the demand for our products decreasing the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

disruptions in the supply of key raw materials and difficulties in the supplier qualification process could adversely impact our operations 

we employ a supply chain management strategy in our reporting segments which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply this strategy has reduced the number of raw material suppliers we have used in recent years this increases the risk that our supply lines may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production problem or financial difficulties if one of our suppliers is unable to supply materials needed for our products or our strategies for managing these risks are unsuccessful we may be unable to complete the process of qualifying new replacement materials for some programs in time to meet future production needs prolonged disruptions in the supply of any of our key raw materials difficulty completing qualification of new sources of supply or in implementing the use of replacement materials or new sources of supply could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition or cash flows 

raw material and energy prices have a significant impact on our profitability if raw material andor energy prices increase and we cannot pass those price increases on to our customers our profitability and financial condition may suffer 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers which include synthetic and natural material aluminum and plastic in addition our manufacturing facilities consume a wide variety of energy products to fuel heat and cool our operations supply and demand factors which are beyond our control generally affect the price of our raw materials and utility costs if we are unable to pass along increased raw material prices and energy costs to our customers our profitability and thus our financial condition may be adversely affected the prices of many of these raw materials and utilities are cyclical and volatile for example the prices of certain commodities particularly petroleumbased raw materials have in the recent past exhibited rapid changes affecting the cost of synthetic elastomers and plastic while we generally attempt to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of sales price increases historically there has been a time delay between raw material andor energy price increases and our ability to increase the prices of our products in some circumstances we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pressure and other factors 

if we are not timely or successful in newproduct innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems our future revenues and operating income could be adversely affected 

our growth partly depends on newproduct innovation and the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications such as the daikyo cz readytouse prefilled syringe system product development and commercialization is inherently uncertain and is subject to a number of factors outside of our control including any necessary regulatory approvals and commercial acceptance for the products the ultimate timing and successful commercialization of new products and systems requires substantial evaluations of the functional operational clinical and economic viability of the companys products in addition the timely and adequate availability of filling capacity is essential to both conducting definitive stability trials and the timing of first commercialization of customers products in cz prefilled syringes delays interruptions or failures in developing and commercializing newproduct innovations or proprietary multicomponent systems could adversely affect future revenues and operating income in addition adverse conditions may also result in future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we may not succeed in finding and completing acquisition or other strategic transactions if any which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we have historically engaged in acquisition activity and we may in the future engage in acquisitions or other strategic transactions such as joint ventures or investments in other entities we may be unable to identify suitable targets opportunistic or otherwise for acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future if we identify a suitable candidate our ability to successfully implement the strategic transaction would depend on a variety of factors including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and to comply with the restrictions contained in our debt agreements strategic transactions involve risks including those associated with integrating the operations or maintaining the operations as separate as applicable financial reporting disparate technologies and personnel of acquired companies joint ventures or related companies managing geographically dispersed operations or other strategic investments the diversion of managements attention from other business concerns the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience unknown risks and the potential loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies joint ventures or companies in which we may make strategic investments we may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire or strategically develop in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits relating to any such strategic transactions strategic transactions may be expensive time consuming and may strain our resources strategic transactions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of among other things the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and amortization expenses of other intangible assets in addition strategic transactions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities 

product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 

the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects unanticipated use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market a recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals 

our operations must comply with environmental statutes and regulations and any failure to comply could result in extensive costs which would harm our business 

the manufacture of some of our products involves the use transportation storage and disposal of hazardous or toxic materials and is subject to various environmental protection and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate this has exposed us in the past and could expose us in the future to risks of accidental contamination and events of noncompliance with environmental laws any such occurrences could result in regulatory enforcement or personal injury and property damage claims or could lead to a shutdown of some of our operations which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations we currently incur costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations and these costs may become more significant 

a loss of key personnel or highly skilled employees could disrupt our operations 

our executive officers are critical to the management and direction of our businesses our future success depends in large part on our ability to retain these officers and other key employees including people in technical marketing sales and research positions competition for experienced employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees our business could be adversely affected although we believe that we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise our inability to do so on a timely basis could disrupt the operations of the unit affected or our overall operations in addition because of the complex nature of many of our products and programs we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled engineering staff and workforce our operations could be disrupted by a shortage of available skilled employees 

the uncertain effects of potential climate change legislation could lead to significantly increased costs 

if legislation or regulations are enacted or promulgated in the united states europe or asia or any other jurisdictions in which we do business that limit or reduce allowable greenhouse gas emissions and other emissions such restrictions could have a significant effect on our operating and financial decisions including those involving capital expenditures to reduce emissions and our results of operations our manufacturing operations may not be able to operate as planned if we are not able to comply with new legal and regulatory legislation around climate change or it may become too costly to operate in a profitable manner additionally suppliers added expenses could be passed on to us in the form of higher prices and we may not be able to pass on such expenses to our customers through price increases 

federal healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations 

the patient protection and affordable care act the “ppaca” was enacted in march 2010 the ppaca reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures the ppaca also imposes significant new taxes on medical device makers in the form of an excise tax on all us medical device sales as defined under the regulations these factors in turn could result in reduced demand for our products and increased downward pricing pressure it is also possible that the ppaca will result in lower reimbursements for our customers products while the ppaca is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the united states the impact of any overall increase in access to healthcare on sales of wests products is uncertain at this time our sales depend in part on the extent to which pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities private insurers and other thirdparty payers for the costs of our products the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers which can vary among public and private sources may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these products in a particular jurisdiction legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the united states as part of the ppaca or abroad for example those under consideration in france germany italy and the united kingdom could significantly reduce reimbursement for our customers products which could in turn reduce the demand for our products 

the full effects of the ppaca cannot be known until all of the provisions are implemented and the centers for medicare  medicaid services and other federal and state agencies issue applicable regulations or guidance moreover in the coming years additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our products we will continue to evaluate the ppaca as amended the implementation of regulations or guidance related to various provisions of the ppaca by federal agencies as well as trends and changes that may be encouraged by the legislation and that may potentially impact our business over time 

no assurance can be given that we will continue to pay or declare dividends 

we have historically paid dividends however there can be no assurance that we will pay or declare dividends in the future the actual declaration and payment of future dividends the amount of any such dividends and the establishment of record and payment dates if any are subject to determination by our board of directors each quarter after its review of our thencurrent strategy applicable debt covenants and financial performance and position among other things our declaration and payment of future dividends is subject to risks and uncertainties including deterioration of our financial performance or position inability to declare a dividend in compliance with applicable laws or debt covenants an increase in our cash needs or decrease in available cash and the business judgment of the board of directors that a declaration of a dividend is not in the companys best interests

we are exposed to credit risk on accounts receivable and certain prepayments made in the normal course of business this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

a substantial majority of our outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance in addition we have made prepayments associated with insurance premiums and other advances in the normal course of business while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on trade receivables and other current assets there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk and avoid losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

unauthorized access to our or our customers information and systems could negatively impact our business 

we face certain security threats including threats to the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data and systems we maintain an extensive network of technical security controls policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems in order to address these threats while these measures are designed to prevent detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems certain types of attacks could result in financial or information losses andor reputational harm if we cannot prevent the unauthorized access release andor corruption of our or our customers confidential classified or personally identifiable information our reputation could be damaged andor we could face financial losses 

if we fail to comply with our obligations under our distributorship or license agreements with daikyo or we are unable to renew these agreements on the same or substantially similar terms we could lose license rights that are important to our business 

key valueadded and proprietary products and processes are licensed from our affiliate daikyo seiko ltd including but not limited to daikyo cz flurotec and b2coating technologies our rights to these products and processes are licensed pursuant to agreements that expire in 2017 part of our longterm strategy is dependent upon these rights if we fail to renew these agreements or if the agreements are terminated early because we fail to satisfy our obligations our business could be adversely impacted

throughout this section references to “notes” refer to the footnotes included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k unless otherwise indicated 

our operations 

we are a manufacturer of components and systems for the packaging and delivery of injectable drugs as well as delivery system components for the pharmaceutical healthcare and consumer products industries our products include stoppers and seals for vials prefillable syringe components and systems components for intravenous and blood collection systems safety and administration systems advanced injection systems and contract design and manufacturing services our customers include the leading global producers and distributors of pharmaceuticals biologics medical devices and personal care products we were incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania on july 27 1923 

our business operations are organized into two reportable segments which are aligned with the underlying markets and customers they serve our reportable segments are the pharmaceutical packaging systems segment “packaging systems” and the pharmaceutical delivery systems segment “delivery systems” packaging systems develops manufactures and sells primary packaging components and systems for injectable drug delivery including stoppers and seals for vials closures and other components used in syringe intravenous and blood collection systems and prefillable syringe components delivery systems develops manufactures and sells safety and administration systems multicomponent systems for drug administration and a variety of custom contractmanufacturing solutions targeted to the healthcare and consumerproducts industries in addition delivery systems is responsible for the continued development and commercialization of our line of proprietary multicomponent systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications we also maintain global partnerships to share technologies and market products with affiliates in japan and mexico 

as a result of our global manufacturing and distribution presence more than half of our revenues are generated outside of the united states in currencies other than the us dollar including 43 in europe and 10 collectively in asia south america and israel fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates therefore can have a significant effect on our consolidated financial results generally our financial results are affected positively by a weaker us dollar and negatively by a stronger us dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business in terms of net sales the most significant foreign currencies are the euro the danish krone and the british pound with eurodenominated sales representing the majority of sales transacted in foreign currencies in addition we are exposed to japanese yen as we maintain a 25 ownership interest in and we purchase finished goods and other materials from daikyo seiko ltd during 2012 average exchange rates were unfavorable versus the exchange rates realized in 2011 resulting in lower reported net sales and operating profit of 461 million and 77 million respectively versus 2011

2013 business outlook 

our business outlook for 2013 anticipates continued revenue improvement driven by customers moving up the product quality and value scale in packaging systems and increasing growth in delivery systems proprietary products as customers accelerate their precommercial efforts in particular we will continue to focus on the expansion of our highvalue closure products and proprietary delivery systems including czbased containment systems we continue to believe that actions taken in recent years to increase capacity for certain products reduce costs through restructuring and lean savings efforts and expand into emerging markets will lead to improved profitability as global demand increases we plan to continue funding capital projects in emerging markets for packaging systems and for new proprietary products within delivery systems during 2013 we expect our capital spending to be up to 150 million for projects such as our new rubber and metal manufacturing facility in india this amount excludes approximately 35 million associated with the construction of our new corporate office and research building which began in 2011 and settled in february 2013 we believe that our strong financial position gives us a platform for sustained growth and will enable us to take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business as they arise see part i item 1a risk factors  of this form 10k for further discussion regarding the risks associated with our operations 

results of operations 

we evaluate the performance of our segments based upon among other things segment net sales and operating profit segment operating profit excludes general corporate costs which include executive and director compensation stockbased compensation adjustments to annual incentive plan expense for over or underattainment of targets certain pension and other retirement benefit costs and other corporate facilities and administrative expenses not allocated to the segments also excluded are items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations such items are referred to as other unallocated items and generally include restructuring and related charges certain asset impairments and other specificallyidentified income or expense items 

for the purpose of aiding the comparison of our yearoveryear results we may refer to net sales and other financial results excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates the constantcurrency amounts are calculated by translating the current year’s functional currency results at the prioryear period’s exchange rate these remeasured results excluding effects from currency translation are not in conformity with us gaap and should not be used as a substitute for the related us gaap financial measures the nonus gaap financial measures are incorporated into our discussion and analysis as management uses them in evaluating our results of operations and believes that this information provides users a valuable insight into our results 

percentages in the following tables and throughout the results of operations  section may reflect rounding adjustments 

net sales 

the following table presents net sales consolidated and by reportable segment 



2012 compared to 2011 

consolidated net sales increased by 741 million or 62 in 2012 despite an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 461 million excluding foreign currency effects consolidated net sales increased by 1202 million or 101 a favorable mix of products and unit volume growth contributed 71 percentage points of the increase and sales price increases contributed 30 percentage points 

packaging systems –  packaging systems’ net sales increased by 577 million or 67 in 2012 despite an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 401 million excluding foreign exchange effects net sales increased by 978 million or 114 a favorable mix of products and unit volume growth contributed 75 percentage points of the increase and sales price increases contributed 39 percentage points in addition to increases in the sales of our standard pharmaceutical packaging components there continued to be strong growth in sales of our higherquality product offerings that reduce particulate contamination and create efficiencies in our customers manufacturing processes including westar readytouse components fluroteccoated closures and the envision line of visioninspected components 

delivery systems –  delivery systems’ net sales increased by 154 million or 46 in 2012 despite an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 60 million excluding foreign exchange effects net sales increased by 214 million or 64 a favorable mix of products and unit volume growth contributed 58 percentage points of the increase and sales price increases contributed 06 percentage points our sales increases during 2012 were led by an increase in healthcarerelated contract manufacturing revenue and higher sales of our proprietary administration systems and éris safety syringe product lines partially offset by a decline in consumer product sales 

2011 compared to 2010 

consolidated net sales increased by 876 million or 79 in 2011 including a favorable foreign exchange impact of 302 million excluding foreign currency effects consolidated net sales increased by 574 million or 52 sales volume contributed 39 percentage points of the increase and sales price increases contributed 13 percentage points of the increase

delivery systems –  delivery systems’ net sales increased by 126 million or 39 in 2011 including a favorable foreign exchange impact of 30 million excluding foreign exchange effects net sales increased by 96 million or 30 a favorable mix of products and sales volume contributed 38 percentage points of the increase partially offset by lower sales prices of 08 percentage points the majority of the sales growth resulted from increased sales 

of contractmanufactured healthcare devices and proprietary administration systems during 2011 despite sales price increases to offset the increased cost of plastic resin overall sales prices were lower due to scheduled price reductions under certain contractmanufacturing agreements 

the intersegment sales elimination which is required for the presentation of consolidated net sales represents the elimination of components sold between our segments 

gross profit 

the following table presents gross profit and related gross margins consolidated and by reportable segment 



2012 compared to 2011 

consolidated gross profit increased by 484 million or 143 in 2012 despite an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 127 million consolidated gross margin increased by 21 percentage points in 2012 primarily as a result of sales price increases and a favorable mix of products sold all of which increased the consolidated gross margin by 36 percentage points improved production and volumerelated efficiencies also increased our consolidated gross margin by 06 percentage points these favorable items were partially offset by the impact of increased raw material costs which reduced our consolidated gross margin by 09 percentage points and wage benefit and other cost increases which reduced our consolidated gross margin by 12 percentage points 

packaging systems –  packaging systems’ gross profit increased by 419 million or 152 in 2012 despite an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 121 million packaging systems’ gross margin increased by 26 percentage points in 2012 primarily as a result of sales price increases and a favorable mix of products sold all of which increased packaging systems’ gross margin by 44 percentage points improved production and volumerelated efficiencies also increased packaging systems’ gross margin by 05 percentage points these favorable items were partially offset by the impact of increased raw material costs and increased wages benefits and other costs which reduced packaging systems’ gross margin by 13 percentage points and 10 percentage points respectively 

delivery systems –  delivery systems’ gross profit increased by 65 million or 104 in 2012 despite an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 06 million delivery systems’ gross margin increased by 11 percentage points in 2012 production efficiencies and favorable raw material prices contributed 10 percentage points and 04 percentage points of the increase respectively partially offset by the net impact of wage benefit and other cost increases in excess of our sales price increases 

2011 compared to 2010 

consolidated gross profit increased by 212 million or 67 in 2011 including a favorable foreign exchange impact of 78 million consolidated gross margin decreased by 03 percentage points in 2011 primarily due to the impact of increased raw material costs which reduced our consolidated gross margin by 22 percentage points sales price increases and product mix improvements increased our gross margin by 15 percentage points but the impact was partially offset by wage and benefit increases which reduced our consolidated gross margin by 06 percentage points improved production efficiencies and cost saving initiatives contributed 13 percentage points to our change in consolidated gross margin in 2011 the majority of the higher raw material costs related to natural rubber and materials linked to hydrocarbon prices such as synthetic polymers and plastic resins 

packaging systems –  packaging systems’ gross profit increased by 185 million or 72 in 2011 including a favorable foreign exchange impact of 75 million packaging systems’ gross margin decreased by 07 percentage points in 2011 primarily due to the impact of increased raw material costs which reduced packaging systems’ gross margin by 25 percentage points sales price increases and a temporary raw material surcharge partially offset the impact from higher raw material costs and other inflationary increases improved production efficiencies contributed 14 percentage points to the change in packaging systems’ gross margin 

delivery systems –  delivery systems’ gross profit increased by 27 million or 45 in 2011 including a favorable foreign exchange impact of 03 million delivery system’s gross margin increased by 01 percentage points in 2011 margin growth was constrained in 2011 due to the impact of contractuallymandated sales price decreases and increased raw material costs which combined to reduce delivery systems’ gross margin by 20 percentage points these factors were fully offset by an improved product mix production efficiencies and lower overhead resulting from our restructuring initiatives 

research and development “rd” costs 



2012 compared to 2011 

rd costs increased by 41 million or 141 in 2012 primarily as a result of development work on the smartdose electronic patch injector system and increased investment in nextgeneration packaging components 

2011 compared to 2010 

rd costs increased by 52 million or 218 in 2011 primarily as a result of development work on the smartdose electronic patch injector system as well as continued development and validation activities for new advanced packaging and readytouse components and formulations 

selling general and administrative “sga” costs 



2012 compared to 2011 

sga costs increased by 270 million or 141 in 2012 primarily due to increases in stockbased compensation expense incentive compensation costs information technology costs and us pension expense all of which were partially offset by foreign currency translation effects which decreased sga costs by 46 million the increase in stockbased compensation expense was primarily due to increased performancebased achievement levels and the impact of higher share prices on our deferred compensation plan liabilities which are indexed to our share price the increase in incentive compensation costs resulted from our current achievement expectations related to our incentive plans in 2012 we also incurred incremental depreciation expense related to new information technology projects as well as incremental depreciation expense and supply and utility costs related to our new corporate office and research building 

2011 compared to 2010 

sga costs increased by 34 million or 18 in 2011 including foreign currency translation effects of 31 million and increased costs for outside services and information technology partially offset by lower stockbased compensation expense resulting from the impact of lower share prices on our deferred compensation plan liabilities which are indexed to our stock price 

restructuring and other items 

the following table presents restructuring charges and other income and expense items for our segments and corporate and other unallocated items 



other income and expense items consisting primarily of gains and losses on the sale of fixed assets foreign exchange transaction gains and losses and miscellaneous income are generally recorded within segment or corporate results certain restructuring impairments and other specificallyidentified gains and losses considered outside of the control of segment management are not allocated to our segments 

during 2012 segment results also included development income of 65 million primarily attributable to services provided to and the reimbursement of certain costs from a delivery systems’ customer 

restructuring and related charges   during 2012 we incurred restructuring and related charges of 21 million to complete the 2010 plan charges incurred during 2012 included facility closure costs and employee severance and benefits associated with a reduction in operations at a manufacturing facility in england as well as facility closure costs associated with the 2011 closure of a plant in the united states during 2012 we finalized an agreement concerning future manufacturing and supply requirements at our manufacturing facility in england which triggered an impairment review of the related assets our review concluded that the estimated fair value of these assets no longer exceeded their carrying value and therefore an impairment charge of 15 million was recorded we estimated the fair value of the assets using an income approach based on discounted cash flows offsetting the costs incurred during 2012 were reductions to certain previouslyrecorded obligations under the 2010 plan including a reduction of 17 million following the cancellation of the restructuring initiative at one of our plants in europe as a result of increased customer demand for products and related efficiency improvements at that plant we do not expect to incur any future charges related to the 2010 plan and the remaining restructuring obligations at december 31 2012 will be reduced to zero as payments are made 

during 2011 we incurred restructuring and related charges of 53 million associated with the 2010 plan charges associated with the plan in 2011 were primarily associated with the 2011 closure of a plant in the united states a reduction of operations at a manufacturing facility in england and the elimination of certain operational and administrative functions in other locations 

during 2010 we incurred restructuring and related charges of 159 million comprised of employee severance and benefits of 105 million fixed asset impairment charges of 44 million and fixed asset relocation costs and other related charges of 10 million the majority of these charges related to the 2010 plan which was designed to reduce our cost structure and improve operating efficiency 

impairment charge  – during 2012 as a result of continuing delays and lowerthanexpected demand we updated the sales projections related to one of our delivery systems’ product lines the revised projections triggered an impairment review of the associated assets our review concluded that the estimated fair value of the product line no longer exceeded the carrying value of the related assembly equipment and intangible asset and therefore an impairment charge of 34 million was recorded we estimated the fair value of the asset group using an income approach based on discounted cash flows 

special separation benefits  – during 2011 we incurred 29 million in special separation benefits related to the retirement of our former president and chief operating officer these costs consisted primarily of stockbased compensation expense and a settlement loss related to one of our nonqualified defined benefit pension plans the respective equity compensation arrangements were amended to allow certain of his awards to continue to vest over the original vesting period instead of being forfeited upon separation resulting in a revaluation of the awards and acceleration of expense 

acquisitionrelated contingencies  – during 2012 and 2011 we increased the liability for contingent consideration related to our 2010 acquisition of technology used in our smartdose ™  electronic patch injector system smartdose contingent consideration by 12 million and 05 million respectively due to fair value adjustments during 2011 and 2010 we reduced the liability for contingent consideration related to our july 2009 acquisition of the eris safety syringe system “éris contingent consideration”by 08 million and 18 million respectively bringing the liability balance to zero this reduction reflects our assessment that none of the contractual operating targets will be achieved over the earnout period which ends in 2014 

  

see note 3 restructuring and other items  for further discussion 

operating profit 

the following table presents operating profit loss by reportable segment corporate and other unallocated costs 



2012 compared to 2011 

consolidated operating profit increased by 255 million or 233 in 2012 despite an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 77 million consolidated operating profit increased primarily due to the increase in consolidated gross profit described above and the decrease in restructuring and other items previously described both of which were partially offset by the increases in rd and sga costs described above 

packaging systems –  packaging systems’ operating profit increased by 349 million or 229 in 2012 despite an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 75 million packaging systems’ operating profit increased primarily due to the increase in packaging systems’ gross profit described above partially offset by increases in rd and sga costs 

delivery systems –  delivery systems’ operating profit increased by 86 million or 878 in 2012 despite an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 02 million delivery systems’ operating profit increased primarily due to the increase in delivery systems’ gross profit described above and the recognition of development income primarily attributable to services provided to and the reimbursement of certain costs from a delivery systems customer both of which were partially offset by increases in rd and sga costs 

corporate –  corporate’s operating loss increased by 193 million or 431 in 2012 primarily due to increases in stockbased compensation expense incentive compensation costs and us pension expense the increase in stockbased compensation expense was primarily due to increased performancebased achievement levels and the impact of higher share prices on our deferred compensation plan liabilities which are indexed to our share price the increase in incentive compensation costs resulted from our current achievement expectations related to our incentive plans in 2012 we also incurred incremental depreciation expense related to new information technology projects as well as incremental depreciation expense and supply and utility costs related to our new corporate office and research building 

2011 compared to 2010 

consolidated operating profit increased by 189 million or 208 in 2011 including a favorable foreign exchange impact of 45 million consolidated operating profit increased primarily due to the increase in consolidated gross profit described above and the decrease in restructuring and other items previously described both of which were partially offset by the increases in rd costs and sga costs described above 

packaging systems –  packaging systems’ operating profit increased by 133 million or 95 in 2011 including a favorable foreign exchange impact of 43 million packaging systems’ operating profit increased primarily due to the increase in packaging systems’ gross profit described above partially offset by an increase in rd costs primarily due to continued development and validation activities for new advanced packaging and readytouse components and formulations 

delivery systems – delivery systems’ operating profit increased by 01 million or 10 in 2011 delivery systems’ operating profit increased primarily due to the increase in delivery systems’ gross profit described above while its rd costs increased primarily as a result of development work on the smartdose electronic patch injector system 

loss on debt extinguishment 

during the year ended december 31 2012 we recognized a pretax loss on debt extinguishment of 116 million related to our repurchase of our convertible debentures which consisted of a 62 million premium over par value 44 million writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs and 10 million in transaction costs 

interest expense net 

the following table presents interest expense net by significant component 



2012 compared to 2011 

interest expense net decreased by 20 million or 118 in 2012 primarily due to increased capitalized interest resulting from recentlycompleted or ongoing capital projects as well as the impact of the retirement at maturity of our 500 million series a floating rate notes and the expiration of the related interest rate swap agreement which we financed under our lowerrate senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility agreement the new credit agreement see note 11 debt  for further discussion of the new credit agreement 

2011 compared to 2010 

interest expense net increased by 07 million or 43 in 2011 primarily due to increased amortization of debtissue costs resulting from the june 2010 refinancing of our revolving credit facility and bank fees related to the construction and acquisition of our new corporate office and research building 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes was 327 million 235 million and 136 million for the years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively resulting in effective tax rates of 302 253 and 183 respectively the increase in the effective tax rate for 2012 primarily reflects changes in our geographic mix of earnings the impact of the discrete tax items discussed below and the nondeductibility of the purchase premium paid in 2012 related to the extinguishment of our convertible debt the increase in the effective tax rate for 2012 also reflects the absence of a research and development tax credit in 2012 as the tax credit expired in 2011 and was not reinstated until the enactment of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 the “act” in january 2013 in accordance with us gaap although the act retroactively reinstated the tax credit for two years from january 1 2012 through december 31 2013 the credit will not be taken into account for financial reporting purposes until the first quarter of 2013 had the act been signed prior to january 2013 our effective tax rate for 2012 would have been reduced by approximately 10 the increase in the effective tax rate for 2011 primarily reflects the higher 2011 pretax income levels and geographic mix of earnings generated by the lower level of restructuring costs in the united states and our increased earnings in europe and asia as well as the impact of the discrete tax items discussed below 

during 2012 as a result of the finalization of estimates of foreign tax credits available with respect to a dividend from one of our foreign subsidiaries we reduced our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset by 10 million we also 

recorded a discrete tax charge of 08 million resulting from the impact of a change in the uk enacted tax rate on our deferred tax balances and recorded a 03 million reduction of our deferred tax assets associated with the legal restructuring of the ownership of our puerto rico operations 

during 2011 we recorded 14 million in net discrete tax charges from changes in international tax rates that affected our deferred tax carrying values 

during 2010 we recognized 11 million in net discrete tax benefits primarily from the resolution of tax contingencies due to the expiration of open periods in various jurisdictions and the closing of a tax audit 

as of december 31 2012 we had 68 million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits of which 66 million if recognized would favorably impact the effective income tax rate it is reasonably possible that due to the expiration of statutes and the closing of tax audits the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced by approximately 20 million during the next twelve months which would favorably impact our effective tax rate 

equity in net income of affiliated companies 

equity in net income of affiliated companies represents the contribution to earnings from our 25 ownership interest in daikyo and our 49 ownership interest in four companies in mexico equity in net income of affiliated companies was 48 million 63 million and 44 million for the years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively equity in net income of affiliated companies decreased by 15 million or 238 in 2012 primarily due to startup costs for a new production facility and increased sga costs at daikyo equity in net income of affiliated companies increased by 19 million or 432 in 2011 primarily due to increased gross profit reported by daikyo on higher sales of their pharmaceutical packaging products and specialty products 

purchases from affiliates totaled 752 million in 2012 664 million in 2011 and 493 million in 2010 the majority of which related to a distributorship agreement with daikyo which allows us to purchase and resell daikyo products sales to affiliates were 35 million 45 million and 24 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively

cash flows 

the following table presents cash flow data for the years ended december 31

2012 compared to 2011   

net cash provided by operating activities was 1874 million in 2012 an increase of 567 million from 2011 net cash provided by operating activities increased in 2012 primarily due to the net sales and gross profit improvements achieved in both our packaging systems and delivery systems segments lower restructuring payments the collection of deposits and timing of other payments 

2011 compared to 2010 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1307 million in 2011 a decrease of 76 million from 2010 net cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2011 primarily due to increased payments made under our restructuring plans and a higher level of pension funding 

net cash used in investing activities   

2012 compared to 2011   

net cash used in investing activities was 1160 million in 2012 a decrease of 45 million from 2011 net cash used in investing activities decreased in 2012 primarily due to a 400 million net change in shortterm investments as we had net sales of shortterm investments of 144 million in 2012 as compared to net purchases of shortterm investments of 256 million in 2011 the shortterm investments represent certificates of deposit primarily in israel with maturities between three and nine months the change related to shortterm investments was partially offset by a 359 million increase in capital spending to 1313 million in 2012 the majority of the increased capital spending was related to construction of our new corporate office and research building which began in 2011 and settled in february 2013 information technology infrastructure improvements and construction of our new compressionmolding plant in china for which validation activities began in january 2013 and commercial production is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2013 

2011 compared to 2010   

net cash used in investing activities was 1205 million in 2011 an increase of 465 million from 2010 net cash used in investing activities increased in 2011 primarily due to a 243 million increase in capital spending and a 239 million increase in net purchases of shortterm investments the shortterm investments represent certificates of deposit primarily in israel with maturities between three and nine months the majority of the increased capital spending was related to the expansion in capacity for manufacturing daikyo crystal zenith syringes at our scottsdale az facility as well as construction on our new compressionmolding plant in china and construction of our new corporate office and research building that began in 2011 

net cash used in financing activities 

2012 compared to 2011 

net cash used in financing activities was 34 million in 2012 a decrease of 213 million from 2011 on june 11 2012 we repurchased 1584 million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible debentures the total cash payment was 1656 million which included the par value of the convertible debentures the purchase premium and related transaction costs on july 5 2012 we concluded a private placement issuance of 1680 million in senior unsecured notes varying in maturities from 10 – 15 years the “notes” on july 30 2012 we used a portion of our new credit agreement to repay our 500 million series a floating rate notes that matured on july 28 2012 

net cash used in financing activities for 2012 included an overall increase in net revolving credit facility borrowings from 2011 and debt issuance costs of 75 million which primarily consisted of the settlement payment made by us for the two forward treasury lock agreements that we entered into and subsequently terminated during 2012 see note 12 derivative financial instruments  and note 11 debt  for further discussion we used cash generated from operations and net borrowings to fund our repurchase of our convertible debentures working capital needs capital expenditures and pension obligations and to pay dividends 

we paid cash dividends totaling 249 million 073 per share and 232 million 069 per share during 2012 and 2011 respectively 

2011 compared to 2010 

net cash used in financing activities was 247 million in 2011 a decrease of 93 million from 2010 net cash used in financing activities decreased in 2011 primarily due to a reduction in net revolving credit facility repayments from 2010 in december 2011 through a series of intercompany dividends from our international subsidiaries to the united states we repatriated cash which was subsequently used to pay down some of our outstanding debt for general corporate purposes and to increase our us cash reserves 

we paid cash dividends totaling 232 million 069 per share and 217 million 065 per share during the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

the table below presents selected liquidity and capital measures as of 



cash and cash equivalents include all instruments that have maturities of ninety days or less when purchased shortterm investments include all instruments that have maturities between ninetyone days and one year when purchased working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents and total invested capital is defined as the sum of net debt and total equity 

cash and cash equivalents –  our cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2012 consisted of cash held in cash depository accounts with banks around the world and cash invested in highquality shortterm investments the cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2012 included 1501 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the united states primarily in germany israel singapore and ireland which is available to fund operations and growth of nonus subsidiaries bringing the cash into the united states could trigger us federal state and local income tax obligations however we may temporarily access cash held by our nonus subsidiaries without becoming subject to us income tax by entering into shortterm intercompany loans 

working capital   working capital at december 31 2012 increased by 667 million or 292 during 2012   including an increase of 25 million due to foreign currency translation excluding the impact of currency exchange rates cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and inventories increased by 680 million 257 million and 89 million respectively partially offset by an increase in total current liabilities of 159 million the increased accounts receivable balance was primarily the result of the increase in net sales described above particularly net sales outside of the united states where payment cycles are typically longer while the increase in current liabilities was primarily due to increases in accounts payable accrued salaries wages and benefits and other current liabilities all of which were partially offset by a decrease in notes payable and other current debt working capital also increased during 2012 as a result of the reclassification of the obligations associated with our new corporate office and research building as of december 31 2012 from current liabilities to longterm debt as of december 31 2012 as described in more detail below 

debt and credit facilities   the 621 million increase in total debt at december 31 2012 as compared to december 31 2011 resulted from net borrowings and related debt activity of 603 million and foreign exchange rate fluctuations of 18 million 

our sources of liquidity include our new credit agreement entered into on april 27 2012 this agreement replaces our prior 2250 million revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in june 2014 the new credit agreement which expires in april 2017 contains a 3000 million committed credit facility and an accordion feature allowing the maximum to be increased through a term loan to 3500 million upon approval by the banks up to 300 million of the credit facility is available for swingline loans and up to 300 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to libor plus a margin ranging from 125 to 225 percentage points which is based on the ratio of our senior debt to modified ebitda at december 31 2012 we had 715 million in outstanding borrowings under this facility of which 57 million was classified as shortterm based upon our intent to repay this portion within the next twelve months and 658 million was classified as longterm based upon our intent and ability to continue the loans beyond one year on june 11 2012 we used our revolving credit facility to fund our repurchase of our convertible debentures which is discussed further in note 11 debt  we had 2249 million of borrowing capacity available under this facility at december 31 2012 we do not expect limitations on our ability to access this source of funds 

in addition we have a 500 million revolving credit facility in february 2013 we borrowed 428 million under this facility primarily to finance the construction and acquisition of our new corporate office and research building construction was completed and settlement occurred in february 2013 at which point the revolving loan balance converted to a fiveyear term loan borrowings under the loan bear interest at a variable rate equal to onemonth libor plus a margin of 150 percentage points in anticipation of this debt in 2011 we entered into a forwardstart interest rate swap which effectively fixes the interest rate at 541 for the fiveyear period beginning in the first quarter of 2013 as of december 31 2012  there was 353 million  in obligations related to the construction and acquisition of our new corporate office and research building in accordance with us gaap we reclassified these obligations from current liabilities to longterm debt as of december 31 2012 as it was our intention at that time to refinance the shortterm obligations on a longterm basis and we consummated the refinancing prior to the issuance of our form 10k 

on july 5 2012 we concluded a private placement issuance of 1680 million in notes the notes rank pari passu with our other senior unsecured debt the proceeds from the issuance reduced indebtedness under our new credit agreement that was incurred to finance our repurchase of our convertible debentures discussed above the weighted average of the coupon interest rates on the notes is 387 in anticipation of this issuance we entered into 

two treasury lock agreements for a total notional amount of 1600 million which were designated as cash flow hedges on june 19 2012 the date the pricing for the notes was finalized both treasury locks were terminated resulting in a 46 million loss which was reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income and which will be expensed over the life of the notes this loss in addition to transaction costs incurred increased the annual effective rate of interest on the notes to an estimated 416 

on july 30 2012 we used a portion of our new credit agreement to repay our 500 million series a floating rate notes that matured on july 28 2012 

refer to note 12 derivative financial instruments  for further discussion of the interestrate hedges mentioned above 

pursuant to the financial covenants in our debt agreements we are required to maintain established interest coverage ratios and to not exceed established leverage ratios in addition the agreements contain other customary covenants none of which we consider restrictive to our operations at december 31 2012 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements throughout 2013 

we believe that cash on hand and cash generated from operations together with availability under our new credit agreement will be adequate to address our foreseeable liquidity needs based on our current expectations of our business operations capital expenditures and scheduled payments of debt obligations 

contingent consideration 

the fair value of the smartdose contingent consideration was determined at the acquisition date using a probabilityweighted income approach and is revalued at each reporting date or more frequently if circumstances dictate changes in the fair value of this obligation are recorded as income or expense within restructuring and other items in our condensed consolidated statements of income the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our contingent consideration are the sales projections and the discount rate used in the calculation significant increases or decreases in any of those inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement as development and commercialization of our smartdose electronic patch injector system progresses we may need to update the sales projections and the discount rate used this could result in an increase or decrease to the contingent consideration liability 

commitments and contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments at december 31 2012 these obligations are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity 



 

 

 

 

reserves for uncertain tax positions   the table above does not include 68 million  of total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2012  due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for amounts which may be paid 

letters of credit   we have letters of credit totaling 36 million  supporting the reimbursement of workers compensation and other claims paid on our behalf by insurance carriers the accrual for insurance obligations was 95 million  at december 31 2012  of which 56 million  is in excess of our deductible and therefore is reimbursable by the insurance company 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2012 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases unconditional purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business and outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

managements discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with us gaap the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions some of which are subjective and complex that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our results of operations and financial position 

revenue recognition  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists title and risk of loss have transferred the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured generally sales are recognized upon shipment or upon delivery to our customers site based upon shipping terms or legal requirements some customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes we record rebate costs when sales occur based on our assessment of the likelihood that the required volumes will be attained we also establish product return liabilities for customer quality claims as we believe that we are able to reasonably estimate the amount of returns based on our substantial historical experience 

impairment of longlived assets longlived assets including property plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable an asset is considered impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future expected undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset once an asset is considered impaired an impairment loss is recorded within restructuring and other items for the difference between the assets carrying value and its fair value for assets held and used in the business management determines fair value using estimated future cash flows to be derived from the asset discounted to a net present value using an appropriate discount rate for assets held for sale or for investment purposes management determines fair value by estimating the proceeds to be received upon sale of the asset less disposition costs 

during 2012 as a result of continuing delays and lowerthanexpected demand we updated the sales projections related to one of our delivery systems product lines the revised projections triggered an impairment review of the associated assets our review concluded that the estimated fair value of the product line no longer exceeded the carrying value of the related assembly equipment and intangible asset and therefore an impairment charge of 34 million was recorded 32 million of which was for the related assembly equipment we estimated the fair value of the asset group using an income approach based on discounted cash flows 

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually following the completion of our annual budget and longrange planning process or whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment as part of the reporting unit to which it belongs our reporting units are the same as or one level below our operating segments the goodwill impairment test first requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill if the carrying amount exceeds fair value a second step must be performed the second step requires the comparison of the carrying amount of the goodwill to its implied fair value which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired as of the testing date any excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the implied fair value would represent an impairment loss considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test such as future sales future cash flows and longterm growth rates are consistent with internal projections and operating plans amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test are also largely dependent on the continued sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products as well as our timeliness and success in newproduct innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems changes in the estimate of fair value including the estimate of future cash flows could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position no impairment in the carrying value of our reporting units was evident as a result of our annual review of goodwill with the exception of our delivery systems americas reporting unit which had a fair value in excess of its carrying value by 20 and which is largely dependent on the continued and anticipated demand for certain of its products including daikyo crystal zenith   products each of our reporting units whose assets included goodwill had a fair value in excess of its respective carrying value by at least 40 at december 31 2012 the goodwill associated with the delivery systems americas reporting unit equaled 319 million or 284 of our total goodwill 

certain trademarks and inprocess rd have been determined to have indefinite lives and therefore are not subject to amortization impairment testing for indefinitelived intangible assets requires a comparison between the fair value and carrying value of the asset and any excess carrying value would represent an impairment fair values are determined using discounted cash flow analyses changes in the estimate of fair value could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position no impairment was evident as a result of our annual review of indefinitelived intangible assets 

intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 

as discussed above during 2012 an impairment charge of 34 million was recorded as the estimated fair value of one of our delivery systems product lines no longer exceeded the carrying value of the related assembly equipment and intangible asset the impairment charge for the intangible asset was 02 million see above for further discussion 

employee benefits  we maintain funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans in the united states and a number of other countries that cover employees that meet eligibility requirements in addition we sponsor postretirement benefit plans which provide healthcare benefits for eligible employees who retire or become disabled the measurement of annual cost and obligations under these defined benefit postretirement plans is subject to a number of assumptions which are specific for each of our us and foreign plans the assumptions which are reviewed at least annually are relevant to both the plan assets where applicable and the obligation for benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees two of the most critical assumptions in determining pension and retiree medical plan expense are the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement age rates of compensation increases mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience for our funded plans we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our plan assets as well as historical and expected rates of return in estimating the longterm rate of return on plan assets under us gaap differences between actual and expected results are generally accumulated in other comprehensive income loss as actuarial gains or losses and subsequently amortized into earnings over future periods 

changes in key assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position we estimate that every 25 basis point reduction in our longterm rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by 05 million and every 25 basis point reduction in our discount rate would increase pension expense by 05 million a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations our net pension underfunded balance at december 31 2012 was 1122 million compared to 1066 million at december 31 2011 our underfunded balance for other postretirement benefits was 260 million at december 31 2012 compared to 217 million at december 31 2011 

income taxes  we estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation in addition deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established to recognize differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities we maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized the recoverability of tax assets is subject to our estimates of future profitability generally at the respective subsidiary company and country level changes in tax legislation business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined 

when accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements we apply a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 

see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 17 new accounting standards  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on accounting and reporting standards considered in the preparation and presentation of our financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risk factors such as fluctuating interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and increasing commodity prices these risk factors can impact our results of operations cash flows and financial position to manage these risks we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps call options and forward exchange contracts for periods consistent with and for notional amounts equal to or less than the underlying exposures in accordance with company policy derivative financial instruments are not used for speculation or trading purposes 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have subsidiaries outside the united states accounting for over 50 of consolidated net sales virtually all of these sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into us dollars for consolidated reporting purposes although the majority of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary they may also hold assets or liabilities denominated in other currencies these items may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains and losses as a result our results of operations and financial position are exposed to changing currency exchange rates we periodically use forward contracts to hedge certain transactions or to neutralize monthend balance sheet exposures on crosscurrency intercompany loans 

we have designated our €815 million eurodenominated notes as a hedge of our net investment in certain european subsidiaries we also have a 5000 million yendenominated note payable which has been designated as a hedge of our net investment in our japanese affiliate at december 31 2012 a cumulative foreign currency translation loss on these net investment hedges of 49 million net of tax of 31 million was recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income 

interest rate risk    

as a result of our normal borrowing activities we have longterm debt with both fixed and variable interest rates longterm debt consists of senior notes convertible debentures revolving credit facilities and capital lease obligations our exposures to fluctuations in interest rates are managed to the extent considered necessary by entering into interest rate swap agreements 

the following table summarizes our interest rate risksensitive instruments 



1 as of december 31 2012  we have two interest rate swap agreements outstanding the first agreement is designed to protect against volatility in variable interest rates payable on our 250 million senior floating rate notes maturing july 28 2015 “series b notes” during the first quarter of 2013 we borrowed 428 million pursuant to a fiveyear term loan with a variable interest rate in anticipation of this debt in 2011 we entered into a forwardstart interest rate swap to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the applicable interest rate over the fiveyear period beginning in the first quarter of 2013 at december 31 2012  these agreements had a fair value of 86 million unfavorable to the company which was recorded as a noncurrent liability refer to note 12 derivative financial instruments  for additional information on these interest rate hedges 

commodity price risk 

many of our packaging systems products are made from synthetic elastomers which are derived from the petroleum refining process we purchase the majority of our elastomers via longterm supply contracts some of which contain clauses that provide for surcharges related to fluctuations in crude oil prices in recent years increases in raw material costs have had an adverse impact on us we expect the volatility in raw material prices to continue we will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects on gross profit 

in may 2012 we purchased a series of call options intended to mitigate our exposure to such oilbased surcharges and protect operating cash flows with regard to a portion of our forecasted elastomer purchases during the months of july through october 2012 by capping our cost of the crude oil component of elastomer prices this allows us to limit our exposure to increasing petroleum prices these call options were not designated as hedging instruments as of december 31 2012 there were no options outstanding

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within west have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein 

changes in internal controls

business segments 

our business operations are organized into two reportable segments which are aligned with the underlying markets and customers they serve our reportable segments are the pharmaceutical packaging systems segment “packaging systems” and the pharmaceutical delivery systems segment “delivery systems” 

packaging systems segment 

our packaging systems segment develops manufactures and sells primary packaging components and systems for injectable drug delivery including stoppers and seals for vials closures and other components used in syringe intravenous and blood collection systems and prefillable syringe components the growth strategy for packaging systems includes organic growth through market segmentation newproduct innovation strategic acquisitions and geographic expansion the primary components we manufacture are subject to regulatory oversight within our customers’ manufacturing facilities we have manufacturing facilities in north and south america europe and asia with affiliated companies in mexico and japan see item 2 properties    for additional information on our manufacturing and other sites 

our packaging systems segment consists of three operating segments — americas europe and asia pacific — which are aggregated for reporting purposes 

the packaging systems business is composed of the following product lines 

pharmaceutical packaging 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disposable medical components 

 

 

 

 

 

laboratory and other services 

 

see note 5 segment information to our consolidated financial statements for net sales information for each of packaging systems’ product lines 

  

elastomeric components are offered in a variety of standard and customerspecific configurations and formulations and are available with advanced barrier films and coatings to enhance their performance west flurotec barrier film is applied using a patented molding process to reduce the risk of product loss by contamination enhance seal integrity and protect the shelf life of packaged drugs we also apply a teflon coating to the surface of stoppers and plungers to improve compatibility between the closure and the drug b2coating is a coating applied to the surface of stoppers and plungers using a patented process that eliminates the need for conventional silicone application it helps manufacturers reduce product rejections due to trace levels of silicone molecules found in noncoated packaged drug compounds flurotec and b2coating technologies are licensed from daikyo seiko ltd 

our tamperevident flipoff seals are sold in a wide range of sizes and colors using the newly introduced color configurator to meet customers’ needs for product identification and differentiation the seals can be provided using proprietary printing and embossing technology for multiple layers of protection such as pointofuse instructions itemlevel information such as vial contents drug dosage and strength and cautionary statements that can serve as counterfeiting deterrence 

the west ready pack containment system is a onesource solution ideal for pharmaceutical research and development and clinical work each system comes with west stoppers flipoff seals and vials conveniently packaged in small volumes because the components are delivered readytouse component preparation is eliminated from our customers’ processing saving them time and money 

the envision automated vision inspection system ensures that components plungers and stoppers meet enhanced quality specifications for visible and subvisible particulate and contamination 

our verisure components are an example of how laboratory services can be combined with a product offering these components allow pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies to navigate the complex task of extractables identification and the related analysis for qualifying a drug product’s containerclosure system more efficiently the customer receives a certificate of analysis with each shipment of components also with a known extractables profile customers are able to begin the design of leachables studies on a quicker basis 

in addition our westar rs and westar ru postmanufacturing processes are documented and fully validated procedures for washing and siliconizing stoppers and syringe components to remove biological materials and endotoxins the westar rs process prepares components for introduction into the customer’s sterilizer and the westar ru process provides sterilized components these processes increase the overall efficiency of injectable drug production by outsourcing component processing thereby eliminating steps otherwise required in each of our customers’ manufacturing processes and help to assure compliance with the latest regulatory requirements for component preparation 

as an adjunct to our packaging systems products we offer contract analytical laboratory services for testing and evaluating primary drugpackaging components and their compatibility with the contained drug formulation west analytical services provides us and our customers with indepth knowledge and analysis of the interaction and compatibility of drug products with elastomer glass and plastic packaging components our analytical laboratories also provide specialized testing for complete drug delivery systems 

delivery systems segment 

our delivery systems segment develops manufactures and sells safety and administration systems multicomponent systems for drug administration and a variety of customer contractmanufacturing solutions targeted to the healthcare and consumerproducts industries in addition delivery systems is responsible for the continued development and commercialization of our line of proprietary multicomponent systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications such as daikyo cz smartdose® confidose® and novaguard™ which are discussed below in further detail as part of its innovation initiative the delivery systems segment has acquired various companies and technologies since 2005 including the tech group inc custom contract manufacturing medimop medical projects ltd and la model ltd administration systems and confidose and éris™ advanced injection systems 

  

we intend to pursue growth in delivery systems through the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications this segment has manufacturing operations in north america and europe see item 2 properties  for additional information on our manufacturing and other sites 

as of march 31 2011 our delivery systems segment consisted of two operating segments — americas and international — which were aggregated for reporting purposes during the second quarter of 2011 we revised our method of internal financial reporting for this segment to better align it with how the segment’s performance is assessed by our chief executive officer who is also the chief operating decision maker as a result the americas and international operating segments have been combined into one segment and separate financial information for them is no longer available this change had no impact on our reportable segments 

the delivery systems business is composed of the following product lines 

healthcare devices 

 

 

 

administration systems 

 

 

advanced injection systems 

 

 

 

consumer products 

 

the delivery systems segment also has expertise in product design and development including inhouse mold design and construction an engineering center for developmental and prototype tooling process design and validation and highspeed automated assemblies technologies include multicomponent molding inmold labeling ultrasonic welding and clean room molding and device assembly 

see note 5 segment information to our consolidated financial statements for net sales information for each of delivery systems’ product lines 

our smartdose electronic patch injector system was introduced during 2010 and is under evaluation by many biopharmaceutical companies this system is designed for controlled subcutaneous delivery of high volume and high viscosity drugs utilizing prefilled daikyo cz cartridges the system is fully programmable has a single pushbutton operation and a hidden needle for safety 

  

the daikyo cz 1ml long insert needle syringe system is the market’s first syringe system without silicone oil lubrication and incorporating an insertmolded needle to avoid the need for adhesive the luer lock version of the daikyo cz syringe system was introduced previously along with several sizes of sterile vials additional sizes of vials continue to be introduced cz technology is licensed from daikyo seiko ltd 

  

our confidose autoinjector system enhances patient compliance and safety the needle remains shielded at all times and retracts automatically after the injection the system eliminates preparation steps and automates the injection of drugs providing patients with a sterile singleuse disposable system that can be readily used at home 

restructuring initiatives 

in december 2010 our board of directors approved a restructuring plan designed to reduce our cost structure and improve operating efficiency the plan involved the 2011 closure of a plant in the united states a reduction in operations at a manufacturing facility in england and the elimination of certain operational and administrative functions in other locations under this plan we expect to incur total restructuring and related charges of approximately 220 million through the end of 2012 total charges incurred during 2011 and 2010 as part of this plan were 198 million 

in november 2009 we announced restructuring plans to exit certain specialized laboratory service offerings due to a change in market demand reduce support personnel primarily associated with information technology applications and consolidate contract manufacturing operations and support functions under this program the total charges incurred in 2010 and 2009 were 90 million the plan and related activities were completed in the fourth quarter of 2010 

see note 3 restructuring and other items to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

international 

we have significant operations outside of the united states they are managed through the same business segments as our us operations – packaging systems and delivery systems sales outside of the united states account for 54 of consolidated net sales for a geographic breakdown of sales see note 5 segment information  to our consolidated financial statements 

although the general business processes are similar to the domestic business international operations are exposed to additional risks these risks include currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar multiple tax jurisdictions and particularly in south america and israel political and social issues that could destabilize local markets and affect the demand for our products 

depending on the direction of change relative to the us dollar foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations see the discussion under the caption summary of significant accounting policies  foreign currency translation in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements we also have exposure to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiary we attempt to minimize some of our exposure to these exchange rate fluctuations through the use of forward exchange contracts and foreign currency denominated debt this hedging activity is generally discussed in note 1 under the caption summary of significant accounting policies – financial instruments and in note 12 derivative financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements in addition see part i item 1a risk factors of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion regarding the risks associated with foreign currency and global markets and part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resource s for additional discussion of our international operations 

  

raw materials 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers aluminum and plastic elastomers include both natural and synthetic materials we have access to adequate supplies of these raw materials to meet our production needs through agreements with suppliers 

 

we employ a supplychain management strategy in our business segments which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply due to regulatory control over our production processes and the cost and time involved in qualifying suppliers we rely on singlesource suppliers for many critical raw materials this strategy increases the risk that our supply chain may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production problem these risks are managed where possible by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites rigid quality control systems surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in case of an interruption in production and therefore we foresee no significant availability problems in the near future 

intellectual property rights 

 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business we own or license numerous patents and have patent applications pending in the united states and in other countries that relate to various aspects of our products in addition key valueadded and proprietary products and processes are licensed from daikyo seiko ltd our patents and other proprietary rights have been useful in establishing our market share and in the growth of our business and are expected to continue to be of value in the future as we continue to develop proprietary products although important in the aggregate we do not consider our business to be materially dependent on any individual patent or license 

 

we also rely heavily on trade secrets manufacturing knowhow and continuing technological innovations as well as inlicensing opportunities to maintain and further develop our competitive position particularly in the area of formulation development and tooling design 

seasonality 

 

although our packaging systems business is not inherently seasonal sales and operating profit in the second half of the year are typically lower than the first half primarily due to scheduled plant shutdowns in conjunction with our customers’ production schedules and the yearend impact of holidays on production 

 

working capital 

 

we are required to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet customer requirements in addition some of our supply agreements require us to purchase inventory in bulk orders which increases inventory levels but decreases the risk of supply interruption levels of inventory are also influenced by the seasonal patterns addressed above for a more detailed discussion of working capital please see the discussion in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resource s 

 

marketing 

 

our packaging systems customers include practically every major branded pharmaceutical generic and biopharmaceutical company in the world packaging systems components and other products are sold to major pharmaceutical biotechnology and hospital supplymedical device companies which incorporate them into their products for distribution to the ultimate enduser 

 

our delivery systems segment sells to many of the world’s largest pharmaceutical biopharmaceutical and medical device companies and to large customers within the personal care and foodandbeverage industries delivery systems components generally are incorporated into our customers’ manufacturing lines for further processing or assembly 

 

  

 

our products and services are distributed primarily through our own sales force and distribution network with limited use of contract sales agents and regional distributors 

 

our ten largest customers accounted for 357 of our consolidated net sales in 2011 but none of these customers individually accounted for more than 10 of net sales 

order backlog 

at december 31 2011 our order backlog was 2898 million all of which is expected to be filled during 2012 the order backlog was 2506 million at the end of 2010 the increase is primarily due to continued sales growth and a lengthening of the average leadtime for sales orders order backlog includes firm orders placed by customers for manufacture over a period of time according to their schedule or upon confirmation by the customer we also have contractual arrangements with a number of our customers products covered by these contracts are included in our backlog only as orders are received 

 

competition 

 

we compete with several companies across our packaging systems product lines however we believe that we supply a major portion of the us market for pharmaceutical elastomer and metal packaging components and also have a significant share of the european market for these components because of the special nature of our pharmaceutical packaging components and our longstanding participation in the market competition is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive costcontrol programs across their operations 

 

we differentiate ourselves from our competition as a fullservice valueadded global supplier that can provide presale formula and engineering development analytical services regulatory expertise and postmanufacturing technologies as well as aftersale technical support customers also appreciate the global scope of west’s manufacturing capability and our ability to produce many products at multiple sites 

 

our delivery systems business competes in very competitive markets for both healthcare and consumer products the markets we serve are also served by many competitors and therefore our market shares are generally less than 5 of the total global markets the competition varies from smaller regional companies to large global molders that command significant market shares there are extreme cost pressures and many of our customers look offshore to reduce cost we differentiate ourselves by leveraging our global capability and by employing new technologies such as highspeed automated assembly insertmolding multishot molding and expertise with multiplepiece closure systems 

because of the more demanding regulatory requirements in the medical device component area there are a smaller number of competitors mostly largescale companies we compete for this market on the basis of our reputation for quality and reliability in engineering and project management diverse contract manufacturing capabilities and knowledge of and experience in complying with fda requirements with our range of proprietary technologies we compete with new and established companies in the area of drug delivery devices including suppliers of prefillable syringes autoinjectors safety needles and other proprietary systems 

 

research and development activities 

we maintain our own researchscale production facilities and laboratories for developing new products and offer contract engineering design and development services to assist customers with new product development our quality control regulatory and laboratory testing capabilities are used to ensure compliance with applicable manufacturing and regulatory standards for primary and secondary pharmaceutical packaging components the engineering departments are responsible for product and tooling design and testing and for the design and construction of processing equipment we continue to seek new innovative opportunities for acquisition licensing partnering or development within injectable packaging and delivery systems most of which will be manufactured and marketed by our delivery systems segment research and development spending will continue to increase as we pursue innovative strategic platforms in prefillable syringe injectable container advanced injection and safety and administration systems 

 

  

 

commercial development of our new products and services for medical and pharmaceutical applications commonly requires several years new products that we develop may require separate approval as medical devices and products that are intended to be used in packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical products will be subject to both customer acceptance of our products and regulatory approval of the customer’s products following our development period 

we spent 116 million in 2011 98 million in 2010 and 90 million in 2009 on research and development for the packaging systems segment the delivery systems segment incurred research and development costs of 175 million 141 million and 109 million in the years 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2011 and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes in 2012 

employees 

as of december 31 2011 we employed approximately 6300 people in our operations throughout the world 




 item 1a  risk factors 

 

the statements in this section describe major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this 2011 form 10k contains some forwardlooking statements that are based on management’s beliefs and assumptions current expectations estimates and forecasts we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forwardlooking statements such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts we have attempted wherever possible to identify forwardlooking statements by using words such as “estimate” “expect” “intend” “believe” “plan” “anticipate” and other words and terms of similar meaning in particular these include statements relating to future actions business plans and prospects new products future performance or results of current or anticipated products sales efforts expenses interest rates foreignexchange rates economic effects the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results 

many of the factors that will determine our future results are beyond our ability to control or predict achievement of future results is subject to known or unknown risks or uncertainties and therefore actual results could differ materially from past results and those expressed or implied in any forwardlooking statement you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements 

unless required by applicable securities law we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise we also refer you to further disclosures we make on related subjects in our quarterly reports on form 10q and 8k reports to the sec 

  

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 

the current uncertainty in the global economy including the continuing effects of recession or slow economic growth in the united states and europe may negatively affect our operating results examples of the effects of these continuing global economic challenges include our suppliers’ and our customers’ inability to access the credit markets at commercially reasonable rates reduction in sales due to customers decreasing their inventories in the nearterm or longterm or due to liquidity difficulties reduction in sales due to shortages of materials we purchase from our suppliers reduction in research and development efforts and expenditures by our customers our inability to hedge our currency and raw material risks sufficiently or at commercially reasonable prices insolvency of suppliers or customers inflationary pressures on our supplies or our products and increased expenses due to growing taxation of corporate profits or revenues our operating results in one or more geographic regions may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region if economic and market conditions in the united states or europe weaken further we may experience material adverse impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our sales and profitability are largely dependent on the sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products if the products developed by our customers in the future use another delivery system our sales and profitability could suffer 

our business depends to a substantial extent on customers continued sales and development of products that are delivered by injection if our customers fail to continue to sell develop and deploy new injectable products or we are unable to develop new products that assist in the delivery of drugs by alternative methods our sales and profitability may suffer 

if we are unable to provide comparative value advantages timely fulfillment of customer orders or resist pricing pressure we will have to reduce our prices which may reduce our profit margins 

we compete with several companies across our major product lines because of the special nature of these products competition is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive cost control programs across their entire operations competitors often compete on the basis of price we differentiate ourselves from our competition as a fullservice valueadded supplier that is able to provide presale compatibility studies and other services and sophisticated postsale technical support on a global basis however we face continued pricing pressure from our customers and competitors if we are unable to resist or to offset the effects of continued pricing pressure through our valueadded services improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures or if we have to reduce our prices our sales and profitability may suffer 

consolidation in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries have experienced a significant amount of consolidation as a result of this consolidation competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased in addition group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has placed pricing pressure on suppliers further consolidation within the industries we serve could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products 

  

we are subject to regulation by governments around the world and if these regulations are not complied with existing and future operations may be curtailed and we could be subject to liability 

the design development manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our products and our customers’ products that incorporate our products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the united states europe and other countries including the fda and the european medicines agency complying with governmental regulation can be costly and can result in required modification or withdrawal of existing products and a substantial delay in the introduction of new products failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or failure to obtain regulatory approval for a new product could result in expenses and actions that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

products incorporating our technologies are subject to regulations and extensive approval or clearance processes which make the timing and success of newproduct commercialization difficult to predict 

the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is expensive and timeconsuming historically most medical devices incorporating our technologies have been subject to the fda’s 510k marketing approval process which typically lasts from six to nine months supplemental or full premarket approval reviews require a significantly longer period delaying commercialization pharmaceutical products incorporating our technologies are subject to the fda’s new drug application process which typically takes a number of years to complete additionally biotechnology products incorporating our technologies are subject to the fda’s biologics license application process which also typically takes a number of years to complete outside of the united states sales of medical devices and pharmaceutical or biotechnology products are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary from country to country the time required to obtain approval for sale internationally may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 

changes in the regulation of drug products and devices may increase competitive pressure and adversely affect our business  

an effect of the governmental regulation of our customers’ drug products devices and manufacturing processes is that compliance with regulations makes it costly and time  consuming for customers to substitute or replace components and devices produced by one supplier with those from another the regulation of our customers’ products that incorporate our components and devices has increased over time if the applicable regulations were to be modified in a way that reduced the cost and time involved for customers to substitute one supplier’s components or devices for those made by another it is likely that the competitive pressure would increase and adversely affect our sales and profitability 

if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights we may harm our ability to compete 

our patents trademarks and other intellectual property are important to our business we rely on patent trademark copyright trade secret and other intellectual property laws as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary information technologies and process we also have obligations with respect to the nonuse and nondisclosure of third party intellectual property we may need to engage in litigation or similar activities to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others any such litigation could require us to expend significant resources and divert the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel from our business operations we cannot assure you that the steps we will take to prevent misappropriation infringement or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of others will be successful in addition effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for some of our trademarks and patents in some countries failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business and results of operations in addition we may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar or duplicative to ours 

  

disruption in our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make and sell products and have a negative impact on our reputation performance or financial condition 

we have manufacturing sites all over the world in addition in some instances the manufacturing of certain product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants the functioning of our manufacturing and distribution assets and systems could be disrupted for reasons either within or beyond our control including extreme weather or longerterm climatic changes natural disasters pandemic war accidental damage disruption to the supply of material or services product quality and safety issues systems failure workforce actions or environmental contamination there is a risk that incident management systems in place may prove inadequate and that any disruption may materially adversely affect our ability to make and sell products and therefore materially adversely affect our reputation performance or financial condition 

the medical technology industry is very competitive and new products may replace our products or cause a reduction in demand 

the medical technology industry is subject to rapid technological changes and we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold we face this competition from a wide range of companies these include large medical device companies some of which have greater financial and marketing resources than we do we also face competition from firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets in some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for diseases that may be delivered without a medical device the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology may render some of our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive 

risks associated with foreign operations including changes in importexport duties political or economic climates or exchange rates may adversely affect our business 

we conduct business in most of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world virtually all of the international sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into us dollars which can result in significant fluctuations in the amount of those sales or earnings the exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future in addition to translation risks we incur currency transaction gains or losses when we or one of our subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction in a currency other than that entity’s local currency the main currencies to which we are exposed besides the us dollar are the euro british pound danish krone singapore dollar and japanese yen 

our international operations are also exposed to the following risks transportation delays and interruptions political and economic instability and disruptions imposition of duties and tariffs import and export controls the risks of divergent business expectations or cultural incompatibility inherent in establishing and maintaining operations in foreign countries difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations labor strikes andor disputes and potentially adverse tax consequences limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies with third parties or our joint venture partners outside of the united states could also create exposure in addition we may not be able to operate in compliance with foreign laws and regulations or comply with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject in the event that these laws or regulations change any of these events could have an adverse effect on our international operations in the future by reducing the demand for our products decreasing the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

  

disruptions in the supply of key raw materials and difficulties in the supplier qualification process could adversely impact our operations 

we employ a supply chain management strategy in our reporting segments which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply this strategy has reduced the number of raw material suppliers we have used in recent years this increases the risk that our supply lines may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production problem or financial difficulties if one of our suppliers is unable to supply materials needed for our products or our strategies for managing these risks are unsuccessful we may be unable to complete the process of qualifying new replacement materials for some programs in time to meet future production needs prolonged disruptions in the supply of any of our key raw materials difficulty completing qualification of new sources of supply or in implementing the use of replacement materials or new sources of supply could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition or cash flows 

raw material and energy prices have a significant impact on our profitability if raw material andor energy prices increase and we cannot pass those price increases on to our customers our profitability and financial condition may suffer 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers which include synthetic and natural material aluminum and plastic in addition our manufacturing facilities consume a wide variety of energy products to fuel heat and cool our operations supply and demand factors which are beyond our control generally affect the price of our raw materials and utility costs if we are unable to pass along increased raw material prices and energy costs to our customers our profitability and thus our financial condition may be adversely affected the prices of many of these raw materials and utilities are cyclical and volatile for example the prices of certain commodities particularly petroleumbased raw materials have in the recent past exhibited rapid changes affecting the cost of synthetic elastomers and plastic while we generally attempt to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of sales price increases historically there has been a time delay between raw material andor energy price increases and our ability to increase the prices of our products in some circumstances we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pressure and other factors 

if we are not timely or successful in newproduct innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems our future revenues and operating income could be adversely affected 

our growth partly depends on newproduct innovation and the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications such as the daikyo cz readytouse prefilled syringe system product development and commercialization is inherently uncertain and is subject to a number of factors outside of our control including any necessary regulatory approvals and commercial acceptance for the products the ultimate timing and successful commercialization of new products and systems requires substantial evaluations of the functional operational clinical and economic viability of the companys products in addition the timely and adequate availability of filling capacity is essential to both conducting definitive stability trials and the timing of first commercialization of customers products in cz prefilled syringes delays interruptions or failures in developing and commercializing newproduct innovations or proprietary multicomponent systems could adversely affect future revenues and operating income in addition adverse conditions may also result in future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

  

we may not succeed in finding and completing acquisition or other strategic transactions if any which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we have historically engaged in acquisition activity and we may in the future engage in acquisitions or other strategic transactions such as joint ventures or investments in other entities we may be unable to identify suitable targets opportunistic or otherwise for acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future if we identify a suitable candidate our ability to successfully implement the strategic transaction would depend on a variety of factors including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and to comply with the restrictions contained in our debt agreements strategic transactions involve risks including those associated with integrating the operations or maintaining the operations as separate as applicable financial reporting disparate technologies and personnel of acquired companies joint ventures or related companies managing geographically dispersed operations or other strategic investments the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience unknown risks and the potential loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies joint ventures or companies in which we may make strategic investments we may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire or strategically develop in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits relating to any such strategic transactions strategic transactions may be expensive time consuming and may strain our resources strategic transactions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of among other things the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and amortization expenses of other intangible assets in addition strategic transactions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities 

product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 

the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects unanticipated use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market a recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals 

our operations must comply with environmental statutes and regulations and any failure to comply could result in extensive costs which would harm our business 

the manufacture of some of our products involves the use transportation storage and disposal of hazardous or toxic materials and is subject to various environmental protection and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate this has exposed us in the past and could expose us in the future to risks of accidental contamination and events of noncompliance with environmental laws any such occurrences could result in regulatory enforcement or personal injury and property damage claims or could lead to a shutdown of some of our operations which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations we currently incur costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations and these costs may become more significant 

  

a loss of key personnel or highly skilled employees could disrupt our operations 

our executive officers are critical to the management and direction of our businesses our future success depends in large part on our ability to retain these officers and other key employees including people in technical marketing sales and research positions competition for experienced employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees our business could be adversely affected although we believe that we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise our inability to do so timely could disrupt the operations of the unit affected or our overall operations in addition because of the complex nature of many of our products and programs we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled engineering staff and workforce our operations could be disrupted by a shortage of available skilled employees 

the uncertain effects of potential climate change legislation could lead to significantly increased costs 

if legislation or regulations are enacted or promulgated in the united states europe or asia or any other jurisdictions in which we do business that limit or reduce allowable greenhouse gas emissions and other emissions such restrictions could have a significant effect on our operating and financial decisions including those involving capital expenditures to reduce emissions and our results of operations our manufacturing operations may not be able to operate as planned if we are not able to comply with new legal and regulatory legislation around climate change or it may become too costly to operate in a profitable manner additionally suppliers’ added expenses could be passed on to us in the form of higher prices and we may not be able to pass on such expenses to our customers through price increases 

federal healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations 

the patient protection and affordable care act the “ppaca” was enacted in march 2010 the ppaca reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures the ppaca also imposes significant new taxes on medical device makers in the form of an excise tax on all us medical device sales these factors in turn could result in reduced demand for our products and increased downward pricing pressure it is also possible that the ppaca will result in lower reimbursements for our customers’ products while the ppaca is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the united states the impact of any overall increase in access to healthcare on sales of west’s products is uncertain at this time our sales depend in part on the extent to which pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities private insurers and other thirdparty payers for the costs of our products the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers which can vary among public and private sources may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these products in a particular jurisdiction legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the united states as part of the ppaca or abroad for example those under consideration in france germany italy and the united kingdom could significantly reduce reimbursement for our customers products which could in turn reduce the demand for our products management continues to evaluate the ppaca and will review regulations to determine the impact on us 

no assurance can be given that we will continue to pay or declare dividends 

we have historically paid dividends however there can be no assurance that we will pay or declare dividends in the future the actual declaration and payment of future dividends the amount of any such dividends and the establishment of record and payment dates if any are subject to determination by our board of directors each quarter after its review of our thencurrent strategy applicable debt covenants and financial performance and position among other things our declaration and payment of future dividends is subject to risks and uncertainties including deterioration of our financial performance or position inability to declare a dividend in compliance with applicable laws or debt covenants an increase in our cash needs or decrease in available cash and the business judgment of the board of directors that a declaration of a dividend is not in the company’s best interests 

  

our results of operations and earnings may not meet guidance or expectations  

we provide public guidance on our expected results of operations for future periods this guidance is comprised of forwardlooking statements subject to risks and uncertainties including the risks and uncertainties described in this 2011 form 10k and in our other public filings and public statements and is based necessarily on assumptions we make at the time we provide such guidance our guidance may not always be accurate if in the future our results of operations for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or if we reduce our guidance for future periods the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 

we are exposed to credit risk on accounts receivable and certain prepayments made in the normal course of business this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

a substantial majority of our outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance in addition we have made prepayments associated with insurance premiums and other advances in the normal course of business while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on trade receivables and other current assets there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk and avoid losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results

 item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

the following discussion is intended to further the reader’s understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of our company it should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying footnotes included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k these historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains a number of forwardlooking statements all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risks discussed in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

throughout this section references to “notes” refer to the footnotes included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k unless otherwise indicated 

our operations 

we are a manufacturer of components and systems for the packaging and delivery of injectable drugs as well as delivery system components for the pharmaceutical healthcare and consumer products industries our products include stoppers and seals for vials prefillable syringe components and systems components for intravenous and blood collection systems safety and administration systems advanced injection systems and contract design and manufacturing services our customers include the leading global producers and distributors of pharmaceuticals biologics medical devices and personal care products we were incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania on july 27 1923 

our business operations are organized into two reportable segments which are aligned with the underlying markets and customers they serve our reportable segments are the pharmaceutical packaging systems segment “packaging systems” and the pharmaceutical delivery systems segment “delivery systems” packaging systems develops manufactures and sells primary packaging components and systems for injectable drug delivery including stoppers and seals for vials closures and other components used in syringe intravenous and blood collection systems and prefillable syringe components delivery systems develops manufactures and sells safety and administration systems multicomponent systems for drug administration and a variety of custom contractmanufacturing solutions targeted to the healthcare and consumerproducts industries in addition delivery systems is responsible for the continued development and commercialization of our line of proprietary multicomponent systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications we also maintain global partnerships to share technologies and market products with affiliates in japan and mexico 

as a result of our global manufacturing and distribution presence more than half of our revenues are generated outside of the united states in currencies other than the us dollar including 44 in europe and 10 collectively in south america asia and other regions fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates therefore can have a significant effect on our consolidated financial results generally our financial results are affected positively by a weaker us dollar and negatively by a stronger us dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business in terms of net sales and operating profit the most significant foreign currencies are the euro the british pound the danish krone and the singapore dollar with eurodenominated sales representing the majority of sales transacted in foreign currencies in addition we are exposed to japanese yen as we maintain a 25 ownership interest in and we purchase finished goods and other materials from daikyo seiko ltd during 2011 average exchange rates were favorable versus the exchange rates realized in 2010 resulting in higher reported net sales and operating profit of 302 million and 45 million respectively versus 2010 

2011 financial performance highlights 

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

we achieved higher net sales in 2011 primarily driven by a favorable mix of products and sales volume a favorable foreign exchange impact and sales price increases yearoveryear sales increases were generated in all of our major geographic regions total sales originating in the united states were 5436 million an increase of 29 from 2010 reflecting higher domestic demand for pharmaceutical packaging components and increased contractmanufacturing activity revenues generated outside of the united states were 6487 million an increase of 125 from 2010 which reflected higher demand in europe and continued growth in the asiapacific region excluding the favorable effects from currency translation our nonus net sales increased 73 and our consolidated net sales increased 52 from 2010 

gross profit increased by 212 million in 2011 including a favorable foreign exchange impact of 78 million consolidated gross margin decreased by 03 percentage points in 2011 primarily due to the impact of increased raw material costs and wage and benefit increases partially offset by sales price increases and product mix improvements as well as improved production efficiencies and cost saving initiatives the cost of natural rubber and materials linked to hydrocarbon prices such as synthetic polymers and plastic resin has increased significantly over the past year during periods of increased manufacturing costs we generally incur incremental costs that are not immediately recoverable from our customers to help mitigate the lagging effect between the pricing mechanisms in our sales contracts and those in our raw material supply agreements we implemented a temporary raw materials surcharge effective july 2011 the surcharge helped offset our raw material costs incurred during the year ended december 31 2011 and remained in effect through the end of the year on a longerterm basis we expect to substantially recover raw material and other cost increases through sales price increases and continued cost reduction initiatives 

2012 business outlook 

our business outlook for 2012 is positive and we anticipate continued revenue improvement driven by highvalue packaging and prefilled syringe components in packaging systems we expect modest growth from proprietary devices in 2012 as development work for the smartdose™ electronic patch injector system continues and our customers execute their premarketing and manufacturing trials for daikyo crystal zenith ® products in addition we continue to believe that a ctions taken in recent years to increase capacity for certain products reduce costs through restructuring and lean savings efforts and expand into emerging markets will lead to improved profitability as global demand gradually increases we plan to continue funding capital projects in emerging markets for packaging systems and for new proprietary products within delivery systems during 2012 we expect our capital spending to be between approximately 135 million and approximately 155 million including 40 million related to the construction of our new corporate office and research building we believe that our strong financial position gives us a solid platform for sustained growth and will enable us to take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business as they arise see part i item 1a risk factors  of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion regarding the risks associated with our operations 

  

results of operations 

we evaluate the performance of our segments based upon among other things segment net sales and operating profit segment operating profit excludes general corporate costs including stockbased compensation adjustments to annual bonus plan expense for over or underattainment and certain pension and other retirement benefit costs also excluded from segment operating profit are items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations such items are referred to as other unallocated items and generally include restructuring and related charges certain asset impairments and other specificallyidentified income or expense items corporate costs include executive and director compensation stockbased compensation expense and other corporate facilities and administrative expenses that are not allocated to the segments 

for the purpose of aiding the comparison of our yearoveryear results we often refer to net sales and other financial results excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates the constantcurrency amounts are calculated by translating the current year’s functional currency results at the prioryear period’s exchange rate these remeasured results excluding effects from currency translation are not in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” and should not be used as a substitute for the related us gaap financial measures the nonus gaap financial measures are incorporated into our discussion and analysis as management uses them in evaluating our results of operations and believes that this information provides users a valuable insight into our results 

percentages in the following tables and throughout the results of operations section may reflect rounding adjustments 

net sales 

the following table presents net sales consolidated and by reportable segment 

 

2011 compared to 2010 

consolidated net sales increased by 876 million or 79 in 2011 including a favorable foreign exchange impact of 302 million excluding foreign currency effects consolidated net sales increased by 574 million or 52 in 2011 sales volume contributed 39 percentage points of the increase and sales price increases contributed 13 percentage points of the increase 

packaging systems – packaging systems’ net sales increased by 724 million or 92 in 2011 including a favorable foreign exchange impact of 272 million excluding foreign exchange effects net sales increased by 452 or 58 in 2011 increased demand for pharmaceutical packaging components primarily in our europe and asia regions contributed 36 percentage points of the increase and sales price increases contributed 22 percentage points of the increase in 2011 there was strong growth in sales of our highvalue pharmaceutical packaging products including the recentlyintroduced envision™ line of visioninspected components daikyo and daikyo rsv readytosterilize validated products and westar®processed and coated closures 

  

delivery systems – delivery systems’ net sales increased by 126 million or 39 in 2011 including a favorable foreign exchange impact of 30 million excluding foreign exchange effects net sales increased by 96 million or 30 in 2011 a favorable mix of products and sales volume contributed 38 percentage points of the increase partially offset by lower sales prices of 08 percentage points the majority of the sales growth resulted from increased sales of contractmanufactured healthcare devices and drug reconstitution devices during 2011 despite sales price increases to offset the increased cost of plastic resin overall sales prices were lower due to scheduled price reductions under certain contractmanufacturing agreements 

2010 compared to 2009 

consolidated net sales increased by 490 million or 46 in 2010 despite an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 137 million excluding foreign currency translation effects consolidated net sales increased by 627 million or 59 in 2010 the increase was principally due to the favorable impact of improved sales volume and mix of 45 percentage points annual sales price increases of 05 percentage points and 09 percentage points resulting from business acquisitions within our delivery systems segment 

packaging systems – packaging systems’ net sales increased by 90 million or 12 in 2010 despite an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of 101 million and the 2009 surge in h1n1 vaccinationrelated sales excluding currency translation effects net sales increased by 191 million or 25 in 2010 resulting from favorable volume and product mix of 142 million and higher sales prices of 49 million the favorable volume and mix came primarily from sales of pharmaceutical packaging products due to increased demand for stoppers and seals used by our customers in packaging serums lyophilized drugs and for intravenous applications contributing to this improvement were increased sales of our advanced pharmaceutical packaging products including westar®processed and flurotec™coated closures as well as envision™inspected components which were first introduced in 2009 the 2010 sales increase was net of the impact from nonrecurring h1n1 sales which benefited 2009 sales by 220 million 

delivery systems – delivery systems’ net sales increased by 391 million or 137 in 2010 despite 36 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation excluding the impact of foreign currency changes net sales increased by 427 million or 150 in 2010 the increase was principally driven by favorable volume and product mix of 324 million and incremental sales from business acquisitions of 102 million the majority of the favorable volume and mix was attributable to healthcare devices due to strong customer demand for contractmanufactured components and increased sales of our proprietary safety and administration systems 

the intersegment sales elimination which is required for the presentation of consolidated net sales represents the elimination of plastic packaging components sold by delivery systems to packaging systems 

gross profit 

the following table presents our gross profit and related gross margins consolidated and by reportable segment 

 

  

2011 compared to 2010 

consolidated gross profit increased by 212 million or 67 in 2011 including a favorable foreign exchange impact of 78 million consolidated gross margin decreased by 03 percentage points in 2011 primarily due to the impact of increased raw material costs which reduced our consolidated gross margin by 22 percentage points sales price increases and product mix improvements increased our gross margin by 15 percentage points but the impact was partially offset by wage and benefit increases which reduced our consolidated gross margin by 06 percentage points improved production efficiencies and cost saving initiatives contributed 13 percentage points to our change in consolidated gross margin in 2011 the majority of the higher raw material costs related to natural rubber and materials linked to hydrocarbon prices such as synthetic polymers and plastic resins 

packaging systems – packaging systems’ gross profit increased by 185 million or 72 in 2011 including a favorable foreign exchange impact of 75 million packaging systems’ gross margin decreased by 07 percentage points in 2011 primarily due to the impact of increased raw material costs which reduced packaging systems’ gross margin by 25 percentage points sales price increases and the temporary raw material surcharge partially offset the impact from higher raw material costs and other inflationary increases improved production efficiencies contributed 14 percentage points to the change in packaging systems’ gross margin 

delivery systems – delivery systems’ gross profit increased by 27 million or 45 in 2011 including a favorable foreign exchange impact of 03 million delivery system’s gross margin increased by 01 percentage points in 2011 margin growth was constrained in 2011 due to the impact of contractuallymandated sales price decreases and increased raw material costs which combined to reduce delivery systems’ gross margin by 20 percentage points these factors were fully offset by an improved product mix production efficiencies and lower overhead resulting from our restructuring initiatives 

2010 compared to 2009 

consolidated 2010 gross profit increased by 145 million or 48 in 2010 despite an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of 30 million as a result of higher sales in both of our reporting segments our gross margin percentage in 2010 was unchanged from the prior year as we were able to maintain margins with higher sales prices and a favorable sales volume and product mix despite increased raw material labor and depreciation expense 

packaging systems – packaging systems’ gross profit increased by 71 million or 28 and the gross margin percentage increased by 06 percentage points in 2010 the increase was primarily the result of improved production efficiencies which resulted from higher volumes and operational costsaving initiatives the impact of sales price increases effectively offset yearoveryear increases in labor cost raw materials and other production costs incurred during the year 

delivery systems – delivery system’s gross profit increased by 74 million or 140 and our gross margin percentage remained constant at 185 the higher gross profit was driven by an improvement in sales mix and higher demand for our contractmanufactured healthcare devices partially offset by increased raw material costs 

research and development “rd” costs 

 

2011 compared to 2010 

rd costs increased by 52 million or 218 in 2011 primarily as a result of development work on the smartdose™ electronic patch injector system as well as continued development and validation activities for new advanced packaging and readytouse components and formulations 

  

2010 compared to 2009 

rd costs increased by 40 million or 201 in 2010 primarily due to the impact of business acquisitions and incremental development spending on delivery systems’ initiatives including various containment and delivery solutions using daikyo’s crystal zenith® technology 

selling general and administrative “sga” costs 

 

2011 compared to 2010 

sga costs increased by 34 million or 18 in 2011 including foreign currency translation effects of 31 million and increased costs for outside services and information technology partially offset by lower stockbased compensation expense resulting from the impact of lower share prices on our deferred compensation plan liabilities which are indexed to our stock price 

2010 compared to 2009 

sga costs increased by 100 million or 56 in 2010 primarily due to higher employee compensation costs for higher sales and other incentive compensation annual salary increases and increased staffing in support of our january 2010 business segment realignment despite the increase in yearoveryear costs sga as a percentage of net sales remained relatively consistent 

restructuring and other items 

other income and expense items consisting primarily of gains and losses on the sale of fixed assets impairments of segment assets and foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are generally recorded within segment or corporate results certain restructuring impairments and other specificallyidentified gains and losses considered outside of the control of segment management are not allocated to our segments 

the following table presents restructuring charges and other income and expense items for our segments and corporate and other unallocated items for each of the three years ended december 31 

 

the majority of the segments’ other expense items for all periods presented was attributable to foreign exchange transaction losses experienced by our subsidiaries on nonfunctional currency trade obligations 

restructuring and related charges – during 2011 we incurred restructuring and related charges of 53 million associated with the restructuring plan announced in december 2010 charges associated with the plan in 2011 were primarily associated with the 2011 closure of a plant in the united states a reduction of operations at a manufacturing facility in england and the elimination of certain operational and administrative functions in other locations we currently expect to incur additional charges related to the plan of approximately 19 million during 2012 

  

during 2010 we incurred restructuring and related charges of 159 million comprised of employee severance and benefits of 105 million fixed asset impairment charges of 44 million and fixed asset relocation costs and other related charges of 10 million the majority of these charges related to the restructuring plan that our board of directors approved in december 2010 which was designed to reduce our cost structure and improve operating efficiency 

during 2009 we recognized restructuring and related charges of 87 million comprised of employee severance and benefits costs of 30 million asset impairment and disposals charges of 53 million and 04 million in asset relocation costs the majority of this charge resulted from our 2009 restructuring plan which affected certain business operations and support functions 

special separation benefits – during 2011 we incurred 29 million in special separation benefits related to the retirement of our former president and chief operating officer these costs consisted primarily of stockbased compensation expense and a settlement loss related to one of our nonqualified defined benefit pension plans the respective equity compensation arrangements were amended to allow certain of his awards to continue to vest over the original vesting period instead of being forfeited upon separation resulting in a revaluation of the awards and acceleration of expense 

acquisitionrelated contingencies – during 2011 and 2010 we reduced the liability for contingent consideration related to our july 2009 eris safety syringe system acquisition by 08 million and 18 million respectively bringing the liability balance to zero this reduction reflects our assessment that none of the contractual operating targets will be achieved over the earnout period which ends in 2014 during 2011 we also increased the liability for contingent consideration related to our 2010 acquisition of technology used in our smartdose electronic patch injector system by 05 million 

brazil tax penalties and amnesty benefits – in 2009 we enrolled in a tax amnesty program that provided for reduced penalties and interest on certain taxrelated obligations resulting in a gain of 20 million 

impairment charge – during 2009 we determined that a costbasis investment that arose from the 2005 divestiture of a former drug delivery business was impaired and we recorded a 08 million charge to writeoff our investment 

see note 3 restructuring and other items to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

operating profit 

operating profit loss by reportable segment corporate and other unallocated costs was as follows 

 

2011 compared to 2010 

consolidated operating profit increased by 189 million or 208 in 2011 including a favorable foreign exchange impact of 45 million consolidated operating profit increased in 2011 primarily due to the increase in consolidated gross profit and the decrease in restructuring and other items described above both of which were partially offset by the increases in rd costs and sga costs described above 

  

packaging systems – packaging systems’ operating profit increased by 133 million or 95 in 2011 including a favorable foreign exchange impact of 43 million packaging systems’ operating profit increased in 2011 primarily due to the increase in packaging systems’ gross profit described above partially offset by an increase in rd costs primarily due to continued development and validation activities for new advanced packaging and readytouse components and formulations 

delivery systems – delivery systems’ operating profit increased by 01 million or 10 in 2011 delivery systems’ operating profit increased in 2011 primarily due to the increase in delivery systems’ gross profit described above while its rd costs increased primarily as a result of development work on the smartdose™ electronic patch injector system 

2010 compared to 2009 

consolidated operating profit decreased by 68 million or 70 in 2010 as a result of an increase in other unallocated charges the majority of which was due to higher restructuring and related charges refer to the restructuring and other items section above for a discussion of these items 

packaging systems – packaging systems’ operating profit increased by 10 million or 07 in 2010 as a result of the improvement in gross profit partially offset by a 39 million increase in sga as a result of higher employee compensation costs excluding a 18 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact packaging systems’ operating profit exceeded the 2009 amount by 28 million 

delivery systems  delivery systems’ operating profit decreased by 02 million or 20 in 2010 as the increase in gross profit was offset by higher sga costs and an increase in rd in support of their key product development projects 

interest expense net 

the following table summarizes our net interest expense 

 

interest expense net increased by 07 million or 43 in 2011 primarily due to increased amortization of debtissue costs resulting from the june 2010 refinancing of our revolving credit facility and bank fees related to the construction and acquisition of our new corporate office and research building 

interest expense net increased by 18 million or 125 in 2010 primarily due to less capitalized interest resulting from significantly lower levels of capital spending in 2010 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes was 235 million in 2011 and 136 million in 2010 resulting in an effective tax rate of 253 and 183 respectively in 2011 we recorded 14 million in net discrete tax charges from changes in international tax rates that affected our deferred tax carrying values in 2010 we recognized 11 million in net discrete tax benefits primarily from the resolution of tax contingencies due to the expiration of open periods in various jurisdictions and the closing of a tax audit in addition to the effects of the discrete tax items the increase in the 2011 effective tax rate as compared to the 2010 effective tax rate reflects the higher 2011 pretax income levels and geographic mix of earnings generated by the lower level of restructuring costs in the united states and our increased earnings in europe and asia 

our 2009 provision for income taxes was 135 million resulting in an overall 162 effective tax rate in addition to the benefit of the items mentioned above the 2010 effective tax rate was higher than the 2009 effective rate due to a reduction in qualified rd activity 

  

our effective tax rate for the year ending december 31 2012 is expected to be approximately 250 absent the impact of discrete tax items or legislative changes in tax rates as of december 31 2011 we had 63 million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits of which 59 million if recognized would favorably impact the effective income tax rate it is reasonably possible that due to the expiration of statutes and the closing of tax audits the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced by approximately 03 million during the next twelve months which would favorably impact our effective tax rate 

equity in net income of affiliated companies 

equity in net income of affiliated companies represents the contribution to earnings from our 25 ownership interest in daikyo japan and our 49 ownership interest in three companies in mexico equity earnings were 63 million 44 million and 30 million for the years 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively equity earnings increased by 19 million or 432 in 2011 primarily due to increased gross profit reported by daikyo on higher sales of their pharmaceutical packaging products and specialty products equity earnings increased by 14 million or 467 in 2010 primarily due to daikyo as higher sales gross profit and royalty income resulted in higher earnings 

purchases from affiliates totaled 664 million in 2011 493 million in 2010 and 454 million in 2009 the majority of which related to a distributorship agreement with daikyo which allows us to purchase and resell daikyo products sales to affiliates were 45 million 24 million and 19 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

net income 

net income in 2011 was 755 million or 216 per diluted share compared to 653 million or 189 per diluted share in 2010 our 2011 results included the impact of restructuring and related charges of 35 million net of 18 million in tax income from the reduction of acquisitionrelated contingencies of 02 million special separation benefits related to the retirement of our former president and chief operating officer of 18 million net of 11 million in tax and the recognition of income tax charges totaling 14 million the majority of which resulted from changes in certain international tax rates which changed the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities 

net income in 2010 was 653 million or 189 per diluted share compared to 726 million or 212 per diluted share in 2009 our 2010 results included the impact of restructuring charges and asset impairments of 102 million net of 57 million in tax income from the reduction of acquisitionrelated contingencies of 16 million net of 02 million in tax and the recognition of income tax benefits totaling 11 million the majority of which resulted from the reversal of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 

net income in 2009 was 726 million or 212 per diluted share compared to 860 million or 250 per diluted share in 2008 our 2009 results included the impact of restructuring charges and asset impairments of 63 million net of 32 million in tax and income tax benefits totaling 61 million primarily relating to reversals of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and the identification of additional qualified rd activities related to prior years 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows 

the following table presents cash flow data for the years ended december 31 

 

  

net cash provided by operating activities 

2011 compared to 2010 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1307 million in 2011 a decrease of 76 million from 2010 net cash provided by operating activities decreased in 2011 primarily due to increased payments made under our restructuring plans and a higher level of pension funding 

2010 compared to 2009 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1383 million in 2010 an increase of 06 million from 2009 net cash provided by operating activities increased in 2010 as a result of favorable variances in other assets and liabilities including lower cash paid for taxes in 2010 

net cash used in investing activities

net cash used in investing activities was 1205 million in 2011 an increase of 465 million from 2010 net cash used in investing activities increased in 2011 primarily due to a 243 million increase in capital spending and a 239 million increase in net purchases of shortterm investments the shortterm investments represent certificates of deposit primarily in israel with maturities between three and nine months the majority of the increased capital spending was related to the expansion in capacity for manufacturing daikyo crystal zenith syringes at our scottsdale az facility which was nearly complete by the end of 2011 as well as construction on our new compressionmolding plant in china which is expected to be completed in 2012 construction of our new corporate office and research building began in 2011 and is expected to be completed in late 2012 or early 2013 with final settlement occurring by early 2013 

2010 compared to 2009 

net cash used in investing activities was 740 million in 2010 a decrease of 479 million from 2009 net cash used in investing activities decreased in 2010 as a result of lower capital spending and reduced spending on business acquisitions cash paid for business acquisitions in 2009 which included the éris safety syringe acquisition was 132 million higher than cash paid for businesses acquired in 2010 capital spending in 2010 totaled 711 million which was a 338 million decrease from the prior year due primarily to the 2009 completion of several significant capital projects packaging systems’ 2010 capital spending was 489 million a decrease of 359 million from the prior year which was attributable to the third quarter 2009 completion of our plastics plant in china our european plants’ expansion project and the implementation of new planning and manufacturing information systems in north america 2010 capital spending for the delivery systems segment was 163 million which was 23 million below the level of spending in the prior year 

net cash used in financing activities 

2011 compared to 2010 

net cash used in financing activities was 247 million in 2011 a decrease of 93 million from 2010 net cash used in financing activities decreased in 2011 primarily due to a reduction in net revolving credit facility repayments from 2010 in december 2011 through a series of intercompany dividends from our international affiliates to the united states we repatriated cash which was subsequently used to pay down some of our outstanding debt for general corporate purposes and to increase our us cash reserves 

we paid cash dividends totaling 232 million 069 per share and 217 million 065 per share during the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

2010 compared to 2009 

net cash used in financing activities was 340 million in 2010 an increase of 114 million from 2009 net cash used in financing activities increased in 2010 primarily due to a larger amount of debt repayments in 2010 compared to 2009 net cash used in financing activities for 2010 included 160 million in net repayment of borrowings and debt issue costs compared with combined net debt repayments of 102 million in 2009 the majority of debt repayments in both years was attributable to borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

we paid cash dividends totaling 217 million 065 per share and 201 million 061 per share during the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

based on our business outlook and our current capital structure we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to fund our current business needs new product development capital expansion pension and other postretirement benefits and to pay dividends we may also use our liquidity from time to time to repay debt fund acquisitions repurchase shares for treasury and to make other investments we expect that our cash requirements for the next twelve months will be met primarily through our cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents on hand shortterm investments and amounts available under our revolving credit facilities 

the table below presents selected liquidity and capital measures as of december 31 

 

cash and cash equivalents include all instruments that have maturities of ninety days or less when purchased shortterm investments include all instruments that have maturities between ninetyone days and one year when purchased working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents and total invested capital is defined as the sum of net debt and total equity 

cash and cash equivalents – our cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2011 consisted of cash held in cash depository accounts with banks around the world and cash invested in high quality shortterm investments the balance of cash and cash equivalents decreased during 2011 primarily due to net purchases of shortterm investments of 256 million cash balances outside of the united states decreased by 236 million in 2011 primarily due to a series of intercompany dividends from our international affiliates to the united states in december 2011 and the impact of weakening foreign currencies primarily the euro during the latter half of 2011 the repatriated cash was subsequently used to pay down some of our outstanding debt for general corporate purposes and to increase our us cash reserves the cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2011 included 727 million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the united states primarily in germany singapore and ireland which is available to fund operations and growth of nonus subsidiaries bringing the cash into the united states could trigger us federal state and local income tax obligations however we may temporarily access cash held by our nonus subsidiaries without becoming subject to us income tax by entering into shortterm intercompany loans 

  

working capital – working capital at december 31 2011 decreased by 381 million or 143 in 2011 including a decrease of 107 million due to foreign currency translation excluding the impact of currency exchange rates cash and cash equivalents decreased by 145 million accounts receivable and inventories increased by 255 million and 93 million respectively and total current liabilities increased by 795 million the increased accounts receivable balance was primarily the result of higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 and increased inventory balances were mostly due to higher raw materials costs and higher quantities of finished goods corresponding with higher orders onhand at december 31 2011 as compared to december 31 2010 the increase in current liabilities was due to a reclassification from longterm debt of 500 million related to our series a note due july 2012 shortterm borrowings under our revolving credit facility and an increase in trade accounts payable corresponding with the increased inventory production 

debt and credit facilities – the 90 million decrease in total debt in 2011 resulted from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of 20 million and net repayments of 70 million as of december 31 2011 we had 64 million in outstanding borrowings under our 2250 million revolving credit facility all of which was classified as longterm debt based upon our intent and ability to continue the loans beyond one year during 2011 we had an average outstanding balance of 200 million under our revolving credit facility including both the short and longterm components 

our sources of liquidity include our 2250 million multicurrency revolving credit facility as of december 31 2011 we had 2153 million of borrowing capacity available under this facility and we have not experienced any limit on our ability to access this source of funds in addition we entered into a credit agreement and related document in june 2011 which contains a 500 million revolving credit facility the proceeds of the loans will be used to finance the construction and acquisition of our new corporate office and research building construction is expected to be completed by the end of 2012 with final settlement occurring by early 2013 on the date of acquisition the revolving loan balance will be converted to a fiveyear term loan borrowings under the loans will bear interest at a variable rate equal to onemonth london interbank offering rates “libor” plus a margin of 150 percentage points in anticipation of this debt we entered into a forwardstart interest rate swap with the same notional amount in order to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the applicable interest rate over the fiveyear period beginning january 2013 under this swap we will receive variable interest rate payments based on onemonth libor plus a margin in return for making monthly fixed interest payments at 541 we designated the forwardstart interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge as of december 31 2011 there were no borrowings under this credit facility 

pursuant to the financial covenants in our debt agreements we are required to maintain established interest coverage ratios and to not exceed established leverage ratios in addition the agreements contain other customary covenants none of which we consider restrictive to our operations as of december 31 2011 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

commitments and contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments at december 31 2011 these obligations are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity 

 

  

 

 

 

 

reserves for uncertain tax positions  the table above does not include 63 million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2011 due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for amounts which may be paid 

letters of credit  we have letters of credit totaling 33 million supporting the reimbursement of workers’ compensation and other claims paid on our behalf by insurance carriers the accrual for insurance obligations was 92 million at december 31 2011 of which 52 million is in excess of our deductible and therefore is reimbursable by the insurance company 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2011 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases unconditional purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs leased equipment and sales tax liability guarantees 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with us gaap the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions some of which are subjective and complex that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our results of operations and financial position 

  

revenue recognition  the majority of our revenue within both segments is generated from product manufacturing operations and sales directly to our customers we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss passes to the customer which may be upon shipment or upon delivery to the customer site based upon shipping terms or legal requirements we offer volume rebates to certain customers as sales incentives provisions for rebates as well as sales discounts and allowances are accounted for as a reduction of sales when revenue is recorded we estimate rebates based on our assessment of the likelihood that required volumes will be attained using available information including historical experience we generally are able to ensure that products meet customer specifications prior to shipment we establish product return liabilities for customer quality claims when such liabilities are deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 

impairment of longlived assets  longlived assets including property plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable an asset is considered impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future expected undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset once an asset is considered impaired an impairment loss is recorded within restructuring and other items for the difference between the assets carrying value and its fair value for assets held and used in the business management determines fair value using estimated future cash flows to be derived from the asset discounted to a net present value using an appropriate discount rate for assets held for sale or for investment purposes management determines fair value by estimating the proceeds to be received upon sale of the asset less disposition costs 

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  g oodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually following the completion of our annual budget and longrange planning process or whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment as part of the reporting unit to which it belongs our reporting units are the same as or one level below our operating segments the goodwill impairment test first requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill if the carrying amount exceeds fair value a second step must be performed the second step requires the comparison of the carrying amount of the goodwill to its implied fair value which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired as of the testing date any excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the implied fair value would represent an impairment loss considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test such as future sales future cash flows and longterm growth rates are consistent with internal projections and operating plans amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test are also largely dependent on the continued sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products as well as our timeliness and success in newproduct innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems changes in the estimate of fair value including the estimate of future cash flows could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position 

certain trademarks and inprocess rd have been determined to have indefinite lives and therefore are not subject to amortization impairment testing for indefinitelived intangible assets requires a comparison between the fair value and carrying value of the asset and any excess carrying value would represent an impairment fair values are primarily determined using discounted cash flow analyses changes in the estimate of fair value could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position 

intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 

  

as part of our annual longrange planning process our sales and marketing teams updated sales projections during the third quarter of 2011 which indicated delays and lowerthanexpected demand for our eris confidose and novaguard product lines the revised projections triggered an impairment review of the assets associated with these product lines our review concluded that the future cash flows associated with these product lines were still expected to exceed the carrying value of the related assets and therefore no impairment charge was required we continued to monitor these product lines during our annual review of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and determined that no impairment charge was required for these product lines at december 31 2011 our investment in equipment and intangible assets excluding goodwill for eris confidose and novaguard was 133 million 59 million and 34 million respectively in addition n o impairment in the carrying value of our reporting units was evident as a result of our annual review of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets with the exception of our israel reporting unit which had a fair value in excess of its carrying value by at least 20 each of our reporting units whose assets included goodwill had a fair value in excess of its respective carrying value by at least 40 

employee benefits  we maintain funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans in the united states and a number of other countries that cover employees that meet eligibility requirements in addition we sponsor postretirement benefit plans which provide healthcare benefits for eligible employees who retire or become disabled the measurement of annual cost and obligations under these defined benefit postretirement plans is subject to a number of assumptions which are specific for each of our us and foreign plans the assumptions which are reviewed at least annually are relevant to both the plan assets where applicable and the obligation for benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees two of the most critical assumptions in determining pension and retiree medical plan expense are the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement age rates of compensation increases mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience for our funded plans we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our plan assets as well as historical and expected rates of return in estimating the longterm rate of return on plan assets under us gaap differences between actual and expected results are generally accumulated in other comprehensive income loss as actuarial gains or losses and subsequently amortized into earnings over future periods 

changes in key assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position we estimate that every 25 basis point reduction in our longterm rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by 05 million and every 25 basis point reduction in our discount rate would increase pension expense by 07 million a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations our net pension underfunded balance at december 31 2011 was 1066 million compared to 712 million at december 31 2010 our underfunded balance for other postretirement benefits was 217 million at december 31 2011 compared to 181 million at december 31 2010 

income taxes  we estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation in addition deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established to recognize differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities we maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized the recoverability of tax assets is subject to our estimates of future profitability generally at the respective subsidiary company and country level changes in tax legislation business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined 

when accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements we apply a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 

see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies and note 17 new accounting standards  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on accounting and reporting standards considered in the preparation and presentation of our financial statements 

  




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risk factors such as fluctuating interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and increasing commodity prices these risk factors can impact our results of operations cash flows and financial position to manage these risks we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps call options and forward exchange contracts for periods consistent with and for notional amounts equal to or less than the underlying exposures in accordance with company policy derivative financial instruments are not used for speculation or trading purposes 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have subsidiaries outside the united states accounting for over 50 of consolidated net sales virtually all of these sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into us dollars for consolidated reporting purposes although the majority of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary they may also hold assets or liabilities denominated in other currencies these items may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains and losses as a result our results of operations and financial position are exposed to changing currency exchange rates we periodically use forward contracts to hedge certain transactions or to neutralize monthend balance sheet exposures on crosscurrency intercompany loans 

we have designated our €815 million eurodenominated notes as a hedge of our net investment in certain european subsidiaries we also have a 5000 million yendenominated note payable which has been designated as a hedge of our net investment in our japanese affiliate at december 31 2011 a cumulative foreign currency translation loss on these net investment hedges of 38 million net of tax of 24 million was recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income 

interest rate risk 

as a result of our normal borrowing activities we have longterm debt with both fixed and variable interest rates longterm debt consists of senior notes convertible debentures revolving credit facilities and capital lease obligations our exposures to fluctuations in interest rates are managed to the extent considered necessary by entering into interest rate swap agreements 

the following table summarizes our interest rate risksensitive instruments 

 

  

1 as of december 31 2011 we have two interest rate swap agreements outstanding which are designed to protect against volatility in variable interest rates payable on a 500 million note maturing on july 28 2012 “series a note” and a 250 million note maturing july 28 2015 “series b note” the first interestrate swap agreement has a notional amount of 500 million and corresponds to the maturity date of the series a note and the second interest rate swap has a notional amount of 250 million and corresponds with the maturity date of the series b note under each of the swap agreements we will receive variable interest rate payments based on threemonth libor in return for making quarterly fixed rate payments the interestrate swap agreements effectively fix the interest rates payable on our series a and b notes at 532 and 551 respectively at december 31 2011 the interest rateswap agreements had a fair value of 88 million unfavorable to the company of which 11 million was recorded as a current liability and 77 million as a noncurrent liability 

commodity price risk 

many of our packaging systems products are made from synthetic elastomers which are derived from the petroleum refining process we purchase the majority of our elastomers via longterm supply contracts some of which contain clauses that provide for surcharges related to fluctuations in crude oil prices in recent years increases in raw material costs have had an adverse impact on us we expect the volatility in raw material prices to continue we will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects on gross profit 

in january 2011 we purchased a series of call options intended to mitigate our exposure to such oilbased surcharges and protect operating cash flows with regard to a portion of our forecasted elastomer purchases during the months of may through november 2011 these call options capped our cost of the crude oil component of elastomer prices for a portion of our forecasted purchases allowing us to limit our exposure to increasing petroleum prices these call options were not designated as hedging instruments as of december 31 2011 there were no options outstanding

 item 9a  controls and procedures 

disclosure controls are controls and procedures designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the exchange act such as this annual report is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our disclosure controls include some but not all components of our internal control over financial reporting 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our ceo and cfo of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k based on this evaluation our ceo and cfo have concluded that as of december 31 2011 our disclosure controls and procedures are effective 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our ceo and cfo to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 based on the framework established in “internal controlintegrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2011 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within west have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein

packaging systems segment 

our packaging systems segment designs manufactures and sells a variety of packaging components and systems used in injectable drug delivery for the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries the growth strategy for packaging systems includes organic growth through market segmentation newproduct innovation strategic acquisitions and geographic expansion the primary components we manufacture are subject to regulatory oversight within our customers’ manufacturing facilities we have manufacturing facilities in north and south america europe and asia with affiliated companies in mexico and japan see item 2 properties    for additional information on our manufacturing and other sites 

our packaging systems segment consists of three operating segments — americas europe and asia pacific — which are aggregated for reporting purposes 

the packaging systems business is composed of the following product lines 

pharmaceutical packaging 

 

 

 

 

 

disposable medical components 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

laboratory and other services 

 

sales of pharmaceutical packaging components represented approximately 60 60 and 59 of consolidated net sales for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively disposable medical components sales as a percent of consolidated net sales were 9 10 and 10 for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

our tamperevident flipoff seals are sold in a wide range of sizes and colors to meet customers’ needs for product identification and differentiation the seals can be provided using proprietary printing and embossing technology for multiple layers of protection such as pointofuse instructions itemlevel information such as vial contents drug dosage and strength and cautionary statements that can serve as counterfeiting deterrence 

elastomeric components are offered in a variety of standard and customerspecific configurations and formulations and are available with advanced barrier films and coatings to enhance their performance west flurotec® coating is a film that is applied using a patented molding process to reduce the risk of product loss by contamination enhance seal integrity and protect the shelf life of packaged drugs we also apply a teflon® coating to the surface of stoppers and plungers to improve compatibility between the closure and the drug b2coating is a coating applied to the surface of stoppers and plungers using a patented process that eliminates the need for conventional silicone application it helps manufacturers reduce product rejections due to trace levels of silicone molecules found in noncoated packaged drug compounds flurotec and b2coating technologies are licensed from our japanese partner daikyo seiko ltd 

the west ready pack system is a onesource solution ideal for pharmaceutical research and development and clinical work each system comes with west stoppers flipoff seals and vials conveniently packaged in small volumes because the components are delivered readytouse component preparation is eliminated from our customers’ processing saving them time and money 

west’s envision components plungers and stoppers are inspected by an automated vision inspection system to ensure they meet enhanced quality specifications for visible and subvisible particulate and contamination 

our verisure components are an example of how laboratory services can be combined with a product offering these components allow pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies to navigate the complex task of extractables identification and the related analysis for qualifying a drug product’s containerclosure system more efficiently the customer receives a certificate of analysis with each shipment of components also with a known extractables profile customers are able to begin the design of leachables studies on a quicker basis 

in addition our postmanufacturing processes westar rs and westar ru are documented and fully validated procedures for washing and siliconizing stoppers and syringe components to remove biological materials and endotoxins westar rs prepares components for introduction into the customer’s sterilizer and westar ru provides sterilized components the westar processes increase the overall efficiency of injectable drug production by outsourcing component processing thereby eliminating steps otherwise required in each of our customers’ manufacturing processes and help to assure compliance with the latest regulatory requirements for component preparation 

as an adjunct to our packaging systems products we offer contract analytical laboratory services for testing and evaluating primary drugpackaging components and their compatibility with the contained drug formulation west analytical services provides us and our customers with indepth knowledge and analysis of the interaction and compatibility of drug products with elastomer glass and plastic packaging components our analytical laboratories also provide specialized testing for complete drug delivery systems

we intend to pursue growth in delivery systems through the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications this segment has manufacturing operations in north america and europe see item 2 properties  for additional information on our manufacturing and other sites 

our delivery systems segment consists of two operating segments — americas and international — which are aggregated for reporting purposes 

the delivery systems business is composed of the following product lines 

healthcare devices 

 

 

 

administration systems 

 

 

advanced injection systems 

 

 

 

consumer products 

 

the delivery systems segment also has expertise in product design and development including inhouse mold design and construction an engineering center for developmental and prototype tooling process design and validation and highspeed automated assemblies technologies include multicomponent molding inmold labeling ultrasonic welding and clean room molding and device assembly 

  

sales of healthcare devices represented approximately 16 of consolidated net sales for 2010 2009 and 2008 personal and consumer product sales as a percent of consolidated net sales were 6 5 and 7 for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

products recently brought to market are the daikyo cz 1ml long insert needle syringe and the confidose autoinjector systems in addition the recently acquired electronic patch injector system was introduced during 2010 and is under evaluation by many biopharmaceutical companies the daikyo cz 1ml long insert needle syringe system is the market’s first syringe system without silicone oil lubrication and incorporating an insertmolded needle to avoid the need for adhesive the luer lock version of the daikyo cz syringe system was introduced previously along with several sizes of sterile vials additional sizes of vials continue to be introduced cz technology is licensed from daikyo seiko ltd our confidose autoinjector system enhances patient compliance and safety with confidose the needle remains shielded at all times and retracts automatically after the injection the system eliminates preparation steps and automates the injection of drugs providing patients with a sterile singleuse disposable system that can be readily used at home 

restructuring initiatives 

in december 2010 our board of directors approved a plan to reduce our cost structure and improve operating efficiency by consolidating certain operations and eliminating a limited number of operational and administrative positions this plan affects employees and manufacturing facilities within both of our reporting segments and involves the closure of a plant in montgomery pennsylvania and a reduction in operations at a manufacturing facility in st austell england we expect to incur approximately 190 million to 210 million in restructuring charges through the end of 2012 as the work at those plants is moved to other facilities restructuring activities will also result in the elimination of approximately 50 administrative engineering and other operating positions at additional locations a total of approximately 367 positions will be eliminated as part of this plan during 2010 we incurred actual charges of 145 million as part of this plan consisting of 101 million in severance and employee benefits and 44 million in asset impairment charges 

in november 2009 we announced restructuring plans for certain business operations and support functions affecting both of our reporting segments the packaging systems plan involved exiting certain specialized laboratory service offerings due to a change in market demand reducing support personnel primarily associated with information technology applications and discontinuing other noncore initiatives and disposing of the associated assets the delivery systems plan was intended to better align our available production capacity with expected levels of contract manufacturing activity by consolidating manufacturing operations and support functions total charges incurred during 2009 and 2010 as part of this program were 90 million which consisted of 34 million in employee severance benefits and asset relocation costs and 56 million in asset impairment and disposal charges primarily related to removing certain laboratory equipment and plant assets from service 

for additional details regarding these programs see note 3 restructuring and other items  to our consolidated financial statements 

international 

we have significant operations outside of the united states “us” they are managed through the same business segments as our us operations – packaging systems and delivery systems sales outside of the us account for approximately 52 of consolidated net sales for a geographic breakdown of sales see the table in note 5 segment information to the consolidated financial statements 

although the general business processes are similar to the domestic business international operations are exposed to additional risks these risks include currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar multiple tax jurisdictions and particularly in south america and israel political and social issues that could destabilize local markets and affect the demand for our products 

  

depending on the direction of change relative to the us dollar foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations see the discussion under the caption summary of significant accounting policies  foreign currency translation in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements we also have exposure to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiary we attempt to minimize some of our exposure to these exchange rate fluctuations through the use of forward exchange contracts and foreign currency denominated debt this hedging activity is generally discussed in note 1 under the caption summary of significant accounting policies – financial instruments and in note 12 derivative financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements 

raw materials 

 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers aluminum and plastic elastomers include both natural and synthetic materials we have access to adequate supplies of these raw materials to meet our production needs through agreements with suppliers 

 

we employ a supplychain management strategy in our business segments which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply due to regulatory control over our production processes and the cost and time involved in qualifying suppliers we rely on singlesource suppliers for many critical raw materials this strategy increases the risk that our supply chain may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production problem these risks are managed where possible by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites rigid quality control systems surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in case of an interruption in production and therefore we foresee no significant availability problems in the near future 

intellectual property rights 

 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business we own or license numerous patents and have patent applications pending in the us and in other countries that relate to various aspects of our products in addition key valueadded and proprietary products and processes are licensed from daikyo seiko ltd our patents and other proprietary rights have been useful in establishing our market share and in the growth of our business and are expected to continue to be of value in the future as we continue to develop proprietary products although important in the aggregate we do not consider our business to be materially dependent on any individual patent or license 

 

we also rely heavily on trade secrets manufacturing knowhow and continuing technological innovations as well as inlicensing opportunities to maintain and further develop our competitive position particularly in the area of formulation development and tooling design 

seasonality 

 

although our packaging systems business is not inherently seasonal sales and operating profit in the second half of the year are typically lower than the first half primarily due to scheduled plant shutdowns in conjunction with our customers’ production schedules and the yearend impact of holidays on production 

 

working capital 

 

we are required to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet customer requirements in addition some of our supply agreements require us to purchase inventory in bulk orders which increases inventory levels but decreases the risk of supply interruption levels of inventory are also influenced by the seasonal patterns addressed above for a more detailed discussion of working capital please see the discussion in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resource s 

 

  

marketing 

 

our packaging systems customers include practically every major branded pharmaceutical generic and biopharmaceutical company in the world packaging systems components and other products are sold to major pharmaceutical biotechnology and hospital supplymedical device companies which incorporate them into their products for distribution to the ultimate enduser 

 

our delivery systems segment sells to many of the world’s largest pharmaceutical biopharmaceutical and medical device companies and to large customers within the personal care and foodandbeverage industries delivery systems components generally are incorporated into our customers’ manufacturing lines for further processing or assembly 

 

west’s products and services are distributed primarily through our own sales force and distribution network with limited use of contract sales agents and regional distributors 

 

our ten largest customers accounted for 417 of our consolidated net sales in 2010 but none of these customers individually accounted for more than 10 of net sales 

order backlog 

at december 31 2010 our order backlog was 2506 million all of which is expected to be filled during 2011 the order backlog was 2387 million at the end of 2009 the increase is primarily due to the timing of shipments as some of our customers focused on reducing their yearend working capital and strengthening demand for our advanced packaging products order backlog includes firm orders placed by customers for manufacture over a period of time according to their schedule or upon confirmation by the customer we also have contractual arrangements with a number of our customers products covered by these contracts are included in our backlog only as orders are received 

 

competition 

 

we compete with several companies across our packaging systems product lines however we believe that we supply a major portion of the us market for pharmaceutical elastomer and metal packaging components and have a significant share of the european market for these components because of the special nature of our pharmaceutical packaging components and our longstanding participation in the market competition is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive costcontrol programs across their operations 

 

we differentiate ourselves from our competition as a fullservice valueadded global supplier that can provide presale formula and engineering development analytical services regulatory expertise and postmanufacturing technologies as well as aftersale technical support customers also appreciate the global scope of west’s manufacturing capability and our ability to produce many products at multiple sites 

 

our delivery systems business competes in very competitive markets for both healthcare and consumer products the competition varies from smaller regional companies to large global molders that command significant market shares there are extreme cost pressures and many of our customers look offshore to reduce cost we differentiate ourselves by leveraging our global capability and by employing new technologies such as highspeed automated assembly insertmolding multishot molding and expertise with multiplepiece closure systems 

because of the more demanding regulatory requirements in the medical device component area there are a smaller number of competitors mostly largescale companies we compete for this market on the basis of our reputation for quality and reliability in engineering and project management diverse contract manufacturing capabilities and knowledge of and experience in complying with fda requirements with our range of proprietary technologies we compete with new and established companies in the area of drug delivery devices including suppliers of prefillable syringes autoinjectors safety needles and other proprietary systems 

 

  

research and development activities 

we maintain our own researchscale production facilities and laboratories for developing new products and offer contract engineering design and development services to assist customers with new product development our quality control regulatory and laboratory testing capabilities are used to ensure compliance with applicable manufacturing and regulatory standards for primary and secondary pharmaceutical packaging components the engineering departments are responsible for product and tooling design and testing and for the design and construction of processing equipment we continue to seek new innovative opportunities for acquisition licensing partnering or development within injectable packaging and delivery systems most of which will be manufactured and marketed by our delivery systems segment research and development spending will continue to increase as we pursue innovative strategic platforms in prefillable syringe injectable container advanced injection and safety and administration systems 

 

commercial development of our new products and services for medical and pharmaceutical applications commonly requires several years new products that we develop may require separate approval as medical devices and products that are intended to be used in packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical products will be subject to both customer acceptance of our products and regulatory approval of the customer’s products following our development period 

we spent 98 million in 2010 90 million in 2009 and 86 million in 2008 on research and development for the packaging systems segment delivery systems incurred research and development expenses of 141 million 109 million and 101 million in the years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2010 and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes for 2011 

employees 

as of december 31 2010 we employed approximately 6600 people in our operations throughout the world 




 item 1a  risk factors 

 

the statements in this section describe major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this 2010 form 10k contains some forwardlooking statements that are based on management’s beliefs and assumptions current expectations estimates and forecasts we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forwardlooking statements such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts we have attempted wherever possible to identify forwardlooking statements by using words such as “estimate” “expect” “intend” “believe” “plan” “anticipate” and other words and terms of similar meaning in particular these include statements relating to future actions business plans and prospects new products future performance or results of current or anticipated products sales efforts expenses interest rates foreignexchange rates economic effects the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results 

many of the factors that will determine our future results are beyond our ability to control or predict achievement of future results is subject to known or unknown risks or uncertainties and therefore actual results could differ materially from past results and those expressed or implied in any forwardlooking statement you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements 

  

unless required by applicable securities law we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise we also refer you to further disclosures we make on related subjects in our quarterly reports on form 10q and 8k reports to the securities and exchange commission 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 

the current uncertainty in the global economy including the continuing effects of recession or slow economic growth in the us and europe may negatively affect our operating results examples of the effects of these continuing global economic challenges include our suppliers’ and our customers’ inability to access the credit markets at commercially reasonable rates reduction in sales due to customers decreasing their inventories in the nearterm or longterm or due to liquidity difficulties reduction in sales due to shortages of materials we purchase from our suppliers reduction in research and development efforts and expenditures by our customers our inability to hedge our currency and raw material risks sufficiently or at commercially reasonable prices insolvency of suppliers or customers inflationary pressures on our supplies or our products and increased expenses due to growing taxation of corporate profits or revenues our operating results in one or more geographic regions may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region if economic and market conditions in the us or europe weaken further we may experience material adverse impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our sales and profitability are largely dependent on the sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products if the products developed by our customers in the future use another delivery system our sales and profitability could suffer 

our business depends to a substantial extent on customers continued sales and development of products that are delivered by injection if our customers fail to continue to sell develop and deploy new injectable products or we are unable to develop new products that assist in the delivery of drugs by alternative methods our sales and profitability may suffer 

if we are unable to provide comparative value advantages timely fulfillment of customer orders or resist pricing pressure we will have to reduce our prices which may negatively impact our profit margins 

we compete with several companies across our major product lines because of the special nature of these products competition is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive cost control programs across their entire operations competitors often compete on the basis of price we differentiate ourselves from our competition as a fullservice valueadded supplier that is able to provide presale compatibility studies and other services and sophisticated postsale technical support on a global basis however we face continued pricing pressure from our customers and competitors if we are unable to resist or to offset the effects of continued pricing pressure through our valueadded services improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures or if we have to reduce our prices our sales and profitability may suffer 

consolidation in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 

the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries have experienced a significant amount of consolidation as a result of this consolidation competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased in addition group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers which has placed pricing pressure on suppliers further consolidation within the industries we serve could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products 

  

we are subject to regulation by governments around the world and if these regulations are not complied with existing and future operations may be curtailed and we could be subject to liability 

the design development manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our products and our customers’ products that incorporate our products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the us europe and other countries including the fda and the european medicines agency complying with governmental regulation can be costly and can result in required modification or withdrawal of existing products and a substantial delay in the introduction of new products failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or failure to obtain regulatory approval for a new product could result in expenses and actions that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

changes in the regulation of drug products and devices may adversely affect our business  

an effect of the governmental regulation of our customers’ drug products devices and manufacturing processes is that compliance with regulations makes it costly and time  consuming for customers to substitute or replace components and devices produced by one supplier with those from another the regulation of our customers’ products that incorporate our components and devices has increased over time if the applicable regulations were to be modified in a way that reduced the cost and time involved for customers to substitute one supplier’s components or devices for those made by another it is likely that the competitive pressure would increase and adversely affect our sales and profitability 

if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights we may harm our ability to compete 

our patents trademarks and other intellectual property are important to our business we rely on patents trademark copyright trade secret and other intellectual property laws as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary information technologies and process we also have obligations with respect to the nonuse and nondisclosure of third party intellectual property we may need to engage in litigation or similar activities to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others any such litigation could require us to expend significant resources and divert the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel from our business operations we cannot assure you that the steps we will take to prevent misappropriation infringement or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of others will be successful in addition effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for some of our trademarks and patents in some foreign countries failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business and results of operations in addition we may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to ours 

disruption in our manufacturing facilities could materially adversely affect our ability to make and sell products and have a negative impact on our reputation performance or financial condition 

we have manufacturing sites all over the world in addition in some instances the manufacturing of certain product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants the functioning of our manufacturing and distribution assets and systems could be disrupted for reasons either within or beyond our control including extremes of weather or longerterm climatic changes natural disasters war accidental damage disruption to the supply of material or services product quality and safety issues systems failure workforce actions or environmental contamination there is a risk that incident management systems in place may prove inadequate and that any disruption may materially adversely affect our ability to make and sell products and therefore materially adversely affect our reputation performance or financial condition 

  

the medical technology industry is very competitive and new products may replace our products or cause a reduction in demand 

the medical technology industry is subject to rapid technological changes and we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold we face this competition from a wide range of companies these include large medical device companies some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do we also face competition from firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets in some instances competitors including pharmaceutical companies also offer or are attempting to develop alternative therapies for disease states that may be delivered without a medical device the development of new or improved products processes or technologies by other companies such as needlefree injection technology may render some of our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive 

risks associated with foreign operations including changes in importexport duties political or economic climates or exchange rates may adversely affect our business 

we conduct business in most of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world virtually all of the international sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into us dollars which can result in significant fluctuations in the amount of those sales or earnings the main currencies to which we are exposed besides the us dollar are the euro british pound danish krone and singapore dollar the exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future in addition to translation risks we incur currency transaction gains or losses when we or one of our subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction in a currency other than that entity’s local currency 

our international operations are also exposed to the following risks transportation delays and interruptions political and economic instability and disruptions imposition of duties and tariffs import and export controls the risks of divergent business expectations or cultural incompatibility inherent in establishing and maintaining operations in foreign countries difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations labor strikes andor disputes and potentially adverse tax consequences limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies with third parties or our joint venture partners outside of the us could also create exposure in addition we may not be able to operate in compliance with foreign laws and regulations or comply with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject in the event that these laws or regulations change any of these events could have an adverse effect on our international operations in the future by reducing the demand for our products decreasing the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

disruptions in the supply of key raw materials and difficulties in the supplier qualification process could adversely impact our operations 

we employ a supply chain management strategy in our reporting segments which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply this strategy has reduced the number of raw material suppliers we have used in recent years this increases the risk that our supply lines may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production problem or financial difficulties if one of our suppliers is unable to supply materials needed for our products or our strategies for managing these risks are unsuccessful we may be unable to complete the process of qualifying new replacement materials for some programs in time to meet future production needs prolonged disruptions in the supply of any of our key raw materials difficulty completing qualification of new sources of supply or in implementing the use of replacement materials or new sources of supply could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition or cash flows 

  

raw material and energy prices have a significant impact on our profitability if raw material andor energy prices increase and we cannot pass those price increases on to our customers our profitability and financial condition may suffer 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers which include synthetic and natural material aluminum and plastic in addition our manufacturing facilities consume a wide variety of energy products to fuel heat and cool our operations supply and demand factors which are beyond our control generally affect the price of our raw materials and utility costs if we are unable to pass along increased raw material prices and energy costs to our customers our profitability and thus our financial condition may be adversely affected the prices of many of these raw materials and utilities are cyclical and volatile for example the prices of certain commodities particularly petroleumbased raw materials have in the recent past exhibited rapid changes affecting the cost of synthetic elastomers and plastic while we generally attempt to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of sales price increases historically there has been a time delay between raw material andor energy price increases and our ability to increase the prices of our products in some circumstances we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pressure and other factors 

we may not be successful in our future acquisition or other strategic transaction endeavors if any which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we have historically engaged in acquisition activity and we may in the future engage in acquisitions or other strategic transactions such as joint ventures or investments in other entities we may be unable to identify suitable targets opportunistic or otherwise for acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future if we identify a suitable candidate our ability to successfully implement the strategic transaction would depend on a variety of factors including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms and to comply with the restrictions contained in our debt agreements strategic transactions involve risks including those associated with integrating the operations or maintaining the operations as separate as applicable financial reporting disparate technologies and personnel of acquired companies joint ventures or related companies managing geographically dispersed operations or other strategic investments the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience unknown risks and the potential loss of key employees customers and strategic partners of acquired companies joint ventures or companies in which we may make strategic investments we may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire or strategically develop in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits relating to any such strategic transactions strategic transactions may be expensive time consuming and may strain our resources strategic transactions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of among other things the incurrence of debt onetime writeoffs of goodwill and amortization expenses of other intangible assets in addition strategic transactions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities 

product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 

the design manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects unanticipated use of our products or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries and could result in certain cases in the removal of a product from the market a recall could result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us in some circumstances such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals 

  

our operations must comply with environmental statutes and regulations and any failure to comply could result in extensive costs which would harm our business 

the manufacture of some of our products involves the use transportation storage and disposal of hazardous or toxic materials and is subject to various environmental protection and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate this has exposed us in the past and could expose us in the future to risks of accidental contamination and events of noncompliance with environmental laws any such occurrences could result in regulatory enforcement or personal injury and property damage claims or could lead to a shutdown of some of our operations which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations we currently incur costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations and these costs may become more significant 

a loss of key personnel or highly skilled employees could disrupt our operations 

our executive officers are critical to the management and direction of our businesses our future success depends in large part on our ability to retain these officers and other key employees including people in technical marketing sales and research positions competition for experienced employees particularly for persons with specialized skills can be intense our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors including compensation and benefits work location and work environment if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees our business could be adversely affected although we believe that we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise our inability to do so timely could disrupt the operations of the unit affected or our overall operations in addition because of the complex nature of many of our products and programs we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled engineering staff and workforce our operations could be disrupted by a shortage of available skilled employees 

the uncertain effects of potential climate change legislation could lead to significantly increased costs 

if legislation or regulations are enacted or promulgated in the us europe or asia or any other jurisdictions in which we do business that limit or reduce allowable greenhouse gas emissions and other emissions such restrictions could have a significant effect on our operating and financial decisions including those involving capital expenditures to reduce emissions and our results of operations our manufacturing operations may not be able to operate as planned if we are not able to comply with new legal and regulatory legislation around climate change or it may become too costly to operate in a profitable manner additionally suppliers’ added expenses could be passed on to us in the form of higher prices and we may not be able to pass on such expenses to our customers through price increases 

federal healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations 

the patient protection and affordable care act the “ppaca” was enacted in march 2010 the ppaca reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures these factors in turn could result in reduced demand for our products and increased downward pricing pressure it is also possible that the ppaca will result in lower reimbursements for our customers’ products while the ppaca is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the united states the impact of any overall increase in access to healthcare on sales of west’s products is uncertain at this time our sales depend in part on the extent to which pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities private insurers and other thirdparty payers for the costs of our products the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of thirdparty payers which can vary among public and private sources may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these products in a particular jurisdiction legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the united states as part of the ppaca or abroad for example those under consideration in france germany italy and the united kingdom could significantly reduce reimbursement for our customers products which could in turn reduce the demand for our products management continues to evaluate the ppaca and will review regulations to determine the impact on us 

  

no assurance can be given that we will continue to pay or declare dividends 

we have historically paid dividends however there can be no assurance that we will pay or declare dividends in the future the actual declaration and payment of future dividends the amount of any such dividends and the establishment of record and payment dates if any are subject to determination by our board of directors each quarter after its review of our thencurrent strategy applicable debt covenants and financial performance and position among other things our declaration and payment of future dividends is subject to risks and uncertainties including deterioration of our financial performance or position inability to declare a dividend in compliance with applicable laws or debt covenants an increase in our cash needs or decrease in available cash and the business judgment of the board of directors that a declaration of a dividend is not in the company’s best interests 

our results of operations and earnings may not meet guidance or expectations  

we provide public guidance on our expected results of operations for future periods this guidance is comprised of forwardlooking statements subject to risks and uncertainties including the risks and uncertainties described in this 2010 form 10k and in our other public filings and public statements and is based necessarily on assumptions we make at the time we provide such guidance our guidance may not always be accurate if in the future our results of operations for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or if we reduce our guidance for future periods the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 

we are exposed to credit risk on accounts receivable and certain prepayments made in the normal course of business this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

a substantial majority of our outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance in addition we have made prepayments associated with insurance premiums and other advances in the normal course of business while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on trade receivables and other current assets there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk and avoid losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results

effective january 1 2010 our business operations were reorganized into two new divisions in order to further align our business units with the underlying markets and customers they serve all historical periods have been restated for the changes to our segment reporting structure we manage and operate our business through the following two segments  pharmaceutical packaging systems “packaging systems” and pharmaceutical delivery systems “delivery systems” packaging systems manufactures and sells primary packaging components and systems for injectable drug delivery including stoppers and seals for vials closures and other components used in syringe intravenous and blood collection systems and prefillable syringe components delivery systems provides safety and administration systems multicomponent systems for drug administration and a variety of custom contractmanufacturing solutions targeted to the healthcare and consumerproducts industries in addition delivery systems is responsible for the continued development and commercialization of our line of proprietary multicomponent systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications west has also formed global partnerships to share technologies and market products with affiliates in japan and mexico 

as a result of our global manufacturing and distribution presence more than half of our revenues are generated outside of the us in currencies other than the us dollar including 42 in europe and 10 collectively in south america asia and other regions fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates therefore can have a significant effect on our consolidated financial results generally our financial results are affected positively by a weaker us dollar and negatively by a stronger us dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business in terms of net sales and operating profit the most significant foreign currencies are the euro the british pound the danish krone and the singapore dollar with eurodenominated sales representing the majority of sales transacted in foreign currencies during 2010 on average the us dollar appreciated almost 5 against the euro and was mixed against other key currencies resulting in lower reported revenues and operating profit of 137 million and 25 million respectively versus the prior year 

2010 financial performance highlights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

we achieved higher sales and gross profit in 2010 when compared to the prior year driven by improved performance of our delivery systems segment and sustained by higher packaging systems sales despite downward pressure from foreign currency exchange rates and the 2009 surge in h1n1 vaccinationrelated sales during 2009 we experienced unusually high demand as a result of the h1n1 vaccination effort that resulted in nonrecurring sales of 220 million in the second half of that year we were able to replace those vaccine sales and grow revenue in 2010 with an improved sales mix and increased demand for other products 

yearoveryear sales increases were generated in all of our major geographic regions total sales originating in the us were 5282 million up 50 from the prior year reflecting higher domestic demand for pharmaceutical packaging components and increased contractmanufacturing activity revenues generated outside of the us were 5765 million an increase of 43 which reflected higher pharmaceutical packaging demand in south america and continued growth in the asiapacific region 

consolidated gross profit improved over the prior year as a result of increased demand an improved sales mix and due to the benefits from costreduction efforts within both segments in addition increased production levels contributed to improved manufacturing efficiency segment operating profit for 2010 was slightly higher than the prior year despite higher rd spending on our key development projects and increased sga in support of our newly reorganized business structure overall our pricing management favorable sales mix and manufacturing cost reduction initiatives resulted in gross profit improvement that outweighed the increased general and administrative costs during 2010 reported operating profit and net income for the current year were lower than 2009 primarily due to higher severance and asset impairment charges resulting from our fourth quarter 2010 restructuring program our financial condition remains strong with increased cash flow from operations and a significant yearoveryear reduction in net debt 

restructuring initiatives 

in december 2010 our board of directors approved a restructuring plan designed to reduce our cost structure and improve operating efficiency by consolidating certain operations and eliminating certain redundant positions the plan involves the 2011 closure of one manufacturing plant in the us and a longerterm reduction in operations at another manufacturing facility in the uk these restructuring activities will also result in the elimination of certain administrative engineering and operating positions at various other locations we expect to incur approximately 190 million to 210 million in total restructuring and related charges through the end of 2012 which consists of 140 million to 150 million in cash expenditures for severance and costs associated with the plant closure and relocation of certain assets and 50 million to 60 million in asset impairment and disposal charges the plan is expected to generate savings of approximately 60 million in 2011 increasing to 120 million annually when fully implemented beginning in 2013 during 2010 we incurred actual charges of 145 million consisting of 101 million in severance and employee benefits and 44 million in asset impairment charges 

in november 2009 we announced restructuring plans to exit certain specialized laboratory service offerings due to a change in market demand reduce support personnel primarily associated with information technology applications and consolidate contract manufacturing operations and support functions the total charges incurred in 2009 and 2010 amounted to 90 million which consisted of 34 million in cash expenditures related to employee severance benefits and asset relocation costs and 56 million in asset impairment and disposal charges primarily related to removing certain laboratory equipment and plant assets from service the plan and related activities were completed in the fourth quarter of 2010 

  

business acquisitions 

in july 2010 our delivery systems segment acquired 100 of the outstanding shares of la model ltd a developer of an electronic patch injector system using prefilled cartridge technology the purchase price included cash paid at closing of 25 million and contingent consideration with an estimated fair value of 15 million the contingent consideration is payable to the selling shareholders based on a percentage of product sales over the next seventeen years the purchase price allocation resulted in 33 million of inprocess research and development assets 12 million of goodwill and 06 million of deferred tax liabilities the operating results which consisted mostly of research and development expense in 2010 were included within the delivery systems segment from the date of acquisition 

in july 2009 we acquired the éris™ safety syringe system and other intellectual property and business assets from plastef investissements sa the éris safety syringe system addresses the market for fixedneedle prefilled syringes and complements our novaguard™ safety system which employs the other common syringe format luerlock syringes the purchase price included cash paid at closing of 169 million and contingent consideration with an original fair value of 26 million which is dependent upon the achievement of operating goals and other milestones from the acquisition date through the end of 2014 the purchase price allocation consisted primarily of 49 million of property plant and equipment 78 million of goodwill and 88 million of other intangible assets offset by 24 million of lease obligations sales and operating results generated from the acquired business were included within our delivery systems segment 

2011 business outlook 

longterm demographic trends are consistent with prior years and continue to drive our growth our business outlook for 2011 is positive but growth will continue to be hampered by a slow global economic recovery consolidation among our pharmaceutical customers and uncertainties surrounding the financial impact of us healthcare reform despite these external factors demand for our products is favorable and we anticipate continued revenue improvement from a favorable mix of product sales including our advanced packaging product offerings and safety and administration systems our highvalue product portfolio is expanding and continues to be a significant area of our focus actions taken in recent years to increase capacity for certain products reduce costs through restructuring and expand into emerging markets will lead to improved profitability as global demand gradually increases given our positive growth outlook we plan to continue funding capital projects in emerging markets for packaging systems and for new proprietary products within delivery systems during 2011 we expect our capital spending to be between 110 million and 130 million our strong financial position gives us a solid platform for sustained growth and will enable us to take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business as they arise 

results of operations 

for the purpose of aiding the comparison of our yeartoyear results we often refer to net sales operating profit and other financial results excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates the constantcurrency amounts are calculated by translating the current year’s functional currency results at the prioryear period’s exchange rate these remeasured results are not in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” and should not be used as a substitute for the related us gaap financial measures the nonus gaap financial measures are incorporated into our discussion and analysis because management believes that these nongaap measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain business trends relating to our financial condition results of operations and our overall performance we believe that the use of these nongaap financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends in comparing our financial measures with other companies 

  

we evaluate the performance of our segments based upon among other things segment sales and operating profit segment operating profit excludes general corporate costs including stockbased compensation adjustments to annual bonus plan expense for over or underattainment and certain pension and other retirement benefit costs also excluded from segment operating profit are items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations such items are referred to as other unallocated items and generally include restructuring and related charges certain asset impairments and other miscellaneous gains and losses corporate costs include executive and director compensation stockbased compensation and other corporate facilities and administrative expenses that are not allocated to the segments 

percentages in the following tables and throughout the results of operations section may reflect rounding adjustments 

net sales 

the following table presents net sales consolidated and by reportable segment 

 

2010 compared to 2009 

consolidated 2010 net sales increased 490 million over those achieved in the prior year despite an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 137 million excluding foreign currency translation effects 2010 net sales increased 627 million or 59 from the prior year the increase was principally due to the favorable impact of improved sales volume and mix of 45 percentage points annual selling price increases of 05 percentage points and 09 percentage points resulting from business acquisitions within our delivery systems segment 

packaging systems – this segment contributed 90 million to the fullyear sales increase despite an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of 101 million and the 2009 surge in h1n1 vaccinationrelated sales excluding currency translation effects sales were 191 million or 25 above prioryear levels resulting from favorable volume and product mix of 142 million and higher selling prices of 49 million the favorable volume and mix came primarily from sales of pharmaceutical packaging products due to increased demand for stoppers and seals used by our customers in packaging serums lyophilized drugs and for intravenous applications contributing to this improvement were increased sales of our advanced pharmaceutical packaging products including westar®processed and flurotec™coated closures as well as envision™inspected components which were first introduced in 2009 the 2010 sales increase was net of the impact from nonrecurring h1n1 sales which benefited 2009 sales by 220 million 

delivery systems – fullyear sales were 391 million higher than 2009 levels despite 36 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation excluding the impact of foreign currency changes sales were 427 million or 150 higher than prioryear levels the increase was principally driven by favorable volume and product mix of 324 million and incremental sales from business acquisitions of 102 million the majority of the favorable volume and mix came from healthcare devices due to strong customer demand for contractmanufactured components and increased sales of our proprietary safety and administration systems 

2009 compared to 2008 

consolidated 2009 net sales increased marginally over those achieved in 2008 despite an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 325 million excluding foreign currency translation effects 2009 net sales increased 371 million or 35 from the 2008 amount the increase was principally due to the favorable impact of annual selling price increases of 19 percentage points improved sales volume and mix of 07 percentage points and 09 percentage points resulting from our july 2009 acquisition of the éris safety syringe business 

  

packaging systems – this segment contributed 156 million to the full year 2009 sales increase net of an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of 299 million excluding currency translation effects sales were 455 million or 60 above prioryear levels the increase was principally driven by higher selling prices of 260 million and favorable volume and product mix of 195 million the favorable volume and mix was due mainly to higher demand for pharmaceutical packaging components including stoppers used in various drugs including the h1n1 influenza vaccine and increased demand for prefilled injection packaging components used in insulin applications 

delivery systems  fullyear sales were 129 million below 2008 levels including 27 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation excluding the impact of foreign currency changes sales were 102 million or 34 below prioryear levels the decrease was the result of reduced selling prices of 64 million due to lower plastic resin prices which are contractually passed through to many customers in the form of adjusted selling prices and unfavorable volume and product mix of 136 million volumes were lower primarily due to the loss of certain contractmanufactured components which were discontinued during 2009 partially offsetting these volume decreases were incremental sales from our éris business acquisition of 98 million 

the majority of intersegment sales eliminations in all periods presented represent sales of plastic packaging components from delivery systems to packaging systems 

gross profit 

the following table presents our gross profit and related gross margins consolidated and by reportable segment 

 

2010 compared to 2009 

consolidated 2010 gross profit increased by 145 million over 2009 fullyear results despite an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of 30 million as a result of higher sales in both of our reporting segments our gross margin percentage in 2010 was unchanged from the prior year as we were able to maintain margins with higher sales prices and a favorable sales volume and product mix despite increased raw material labor and depreciation expense 

packaging systems – our reported gross profit of 2580 million increased 71 million and the gross margin percentage increased 06 percentage points compared with the 2009 results the increase was primarily the result of improved production efficiencies which resulted from higher volumes and operational costsaving initiatives the impact of selling price increases effectively offset yearoveryear increases in labor cost raw materials and other production costs incurred during the year 

delivery systems – reported 2010 gross profit of 601 million increased by 74 million compared with the fullyear 2009 result and our gross margin percentage remained constant at 185 the higher gross profit was driven by an improvement in sales mix and higher demand for our contractmanufactured healthcare devices partially offset by increased raw material costs 

  

2009 compared to 2008 

consolidated gross profit increased by 10 million over 2008 fullyear results despite an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of 87 million excluding foreign exchange impacts gross profit increased by 97 million or 32 as a result of higher selling prices and a significant fourth quarter increase in volume and mix contributed by packaging systems our overall gross margin percentage remained consistent with 2008 as we were able to maintain margins through sales price increases and improved volume and mix partially offset by higher depreciation expense as described below 

packaging systems – our reported gross profit of 2509 million was relatively consistent when compared with the 2008 results despite an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 76 million however the 2009 gross margin percentage for packaging systems declined by 07 percentage points compared with 2008 the decline was attributable to higher depreciation expense resulting from our global capital expansion activity which began in the latter half of 2008 

delivery systems – reported gross profit of 527 million increased by 08 million compared with the fullyear 2008 results including 11 million in unfavorable foreign currency effects consistent with the increase in gross profit our 2009 gross margin percentage improved 11 percentage points to 185 compared with the prior year largely due to the impact of reduced resin costs on selling prices which resulted in a higher ratio of gross profit to revenues 

research and development “rd” costs 

 

rd costs during 2010 were 40 million higher than those incurred in 2009 primarily due to the impact of business acquisitions and incremental development spending on delivery systems’ initiatives including various containment and delivery solutions using daikyo’s crystal zenith® technology rd costs during 2009 were 12 million higher than those incurred in 2008 mostly due to accelerated development spending on our highvalue packaging and injection systems and readytouse components 

selling general and administrative “sga” costs 

 

2010 compared to 2009 

consolidated sga expenses increased 100 million above those recognized in 2009 the increase was primarily the result of higher employee compensation costs for higher sales and other incentive compensation annual salary increases and increased staffing in support of our january 2010 business segment realignment despite the increase in yearoveryear costs sga as a percentage of net sales remained relatively consistent at 170 for 2011 we expect cost control efforts to result in lower yearoveryear growth in sga when compared with 2010 and 2009 

2009 compared to 2008 

consolidated sga expenses in 2009 were 184 million higher than the 2008 amount and sga as a percentage of net sales increased by 16 percentage points versus the prior year the majority of this increase resulted from higher us pension and other retirement plan costs us pension and other retirement benefits expense in 2009 was 107 million higher than the 2008 amount due to increased amortization of actuarial losses and a lower return on plan assets resulting from the loss in plan asset values during the 2008 stock market decline other yearoveryear increases resulted from higher employee compensation costs due to increased staffing of information technology and other support functions and from the impact of annual salary increases 

  

restructuring impairment and other items 

other income and expense items consisting primarily of gains losses or impairments of segment assets and foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are generally recorded within segment and corporate results certain restructuring impairments and other specifically identified gains and losses considered outside the control of segment management are not allocated to our reporting segments 

the following table summarizes our restructuring charges impairments and other income and expense items for each of the three years ended december 31 

 

for 2010 the increase in segments’ other expense was attributable to foreign exchange transaction losses on accounts payable primarily due to the appreciation of the us dollar and japanese yen versus the euro 

restructuring and related charges – during 2010 we incurred restructuring and related charges of 159 million comprised of employee severance and benefits of 105 million fixed asset impairment charges of 44 million and fixed asset relocation costs and other related charges of 10 million the majority of these charges related to the restructuring plan announced in december of 2010 

during 2009 we recognized restructuring and related charges of 87 million comprised of employee severance and benefits costs of 30 million asset impairment and disposals charges of 53 million and 04 million in asset relocation costs the majority of this charge resulted from our fourthquarter 2009 restructuring plan during 2008 we incurred 30 million in restructuring costs consisting mostly of employee severance benefits asset impairments and accelerated depreciation associated with the completion of a plan initiated in late 2007 by our former tech group segment 

acquisitionrelated contingencies – during 2010 we reduced our liability for contingent consideration associated with our 2009 éris acquisition by 18 million to reflect our revised assessment of fair value as affected by a reduction in the probability of attaining certain milestones over the next four years 

brazil tax penalties and amnesty benefits – in the third quarter of 2009 we enrolled in a tax amnesty program which provided for reduced penalties and interest on certain taxrelated obligations resulting in a gain of 20 million 

impairment charge contract settlement and related gain net – during the fourth quarter of 2009 we determined that a costbasis investment that arose from the 2005 divestiture of a former drug delivery business was impaired and we recorded a 08 million charge to writeoff our investment during 2007 and 2008 under a contractsettlement agreement with a former customer we received reimbursement for costs associated with the shutdown of manufacturing operations related to their device during 2008 cash received more than offset costs incurred resulting in a net gain of 42 million 

refer to note 3 restructuring and other items to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the restructuring impairment and other items within this section 

  

operating profit 

operating profit loss by reportable segment corporate and other unallocated costs was as follows 

 

2010 compared to 2009 

consolidated operating profit for 2010 was lower than the prior year as a result of an increase in other unallocated charges the majority of which was due to higher restructuring and related charges refer to the restructuring impairment and other items section above for a discussion of these items 

packaging systems  our 2010 results for packaging systems were higher by 10 million as a result of the improvement in gross profit partially offset by a 39 million increase in sga as a result of higher employee compensation costs excluding a 18 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact packaging systems’ operating profit exceeded the 2009 amount by 28 million 

delivery systems  delivery systems operating profit was 02 million below that achieved in 2009 as the increase in gross profit was offset by higher sga costs and an increase in rd in support of their key product development projects 

2009 compared to 2008 

consolidated operating profit for 2009 was lower by 266 million when compared with 2008 the majority of which related to higher corporate and other unallocated costs of 203 million the majority of the increased corporate costs related to the us pension and other retirement benefits expense other unallocated costs were higher mainly as a result of restructuring and related charges incurred in 2009 compared with a net gain from a former customer contract settlement recorded in 2008 yearoveryear segment operating profit declined 63 million as described below 

packaging systems  the packaging systems segment’s 2009 results were lower by 43 million primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates the yearoveryear unfavorable foreign exchange impact was 39 million the majority of which resulted from the strengthening of the us dollar versus the euro during 2009 excluding the unfavorable foreign currency changes 2009 operating profit for packaging systems was lower by 04 million compared with 2008 

delivery systems  delivery systems’ 2009 operating profit was 20 million below that achieved in 2008 largely due to increased sga costs for annual compensation increases and costs associated with our information systems upgrades in addition unfavorable foreign currency changes which reduced operating profit by 12 million 

interest expense net 

the following table summarizes our net interest expense 

 

  

consolidated interest expense net for 2010 was higher than the prior year due to less capitalized interest resulting from significantly lower levels of capital spending in the current year refer to the cash flows from investing activities section below for a yearoveryear comparison of capital spending 

consolidated interest expense net for 2009 was relatively consistent with the prior year as lower interest rates reduced both interest expense on our variable rate revolving credit facility and interest income on bank deposits the majority of capitalized interest during both 2009 and 2008 resulted from our plant expansion projects in europe and the construction of our new plastics plant in china 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes was 136 million in 2010 and 135 million in 2009 resulting in an effective tax rate of 183 and 162 respectively we recorded tax provision benefits of 11 million in the current year the majority of which resulted from the expiration of open tax periods in various us and foreign tax jurisdictions our 2010 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by changes in our business mix which resulted in a higher percentage of pretax income being generated in lower taxrate jurisdictions compared with the prior year during 2009 we recognized tax credits of 24 million resulting from the identification of additional qualified rd activities related to prior years and other tax provision benefits of 09 million primarily from the reversal of valuation allowances on prioryear tax losses carried forward in 2009 we also recognized a 28 million net tax provision benefit principally resulting from the completion of a tax audit and the expiration of open tax periods in various tax jurisdictions 

our 2008 provision for income taxes was 237 million resulting in an overall 216 effective tax rate in addition to the benefit of the items mentioned above the 2009 effective tax rate was lower than the 2008 effective rate due to a larger amount of us foreign tax credits on taxes paid in certain foreign jurisdictions and increased 2009 development activities that qualified for rd tax credits 

our effective tax rate for the year ending december 31 2011 is expected to be approximately 24 absent the impact of discrete tax items or legislative changes in tax rates as of december 31 2010 we had 50 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits it is reasonably possible that due to the expiration of statutes and the closing of tax audits this liability for unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced by approximately 08 million during 2011 which would favorably impact our effective tax rate 

equity in net income of affiliates 

equity in net income from our 25 ownership interest in daikyo japan and our 49 ownership interest in three mexican affiliates was 44 million 30 million and 08 million for the years 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the majority of the 2010 and 2009 yearoveryear increases were generated by daikyo as higher sales gross profit and royalty income resulted in higher earnings daikyo’s net income for 2008 was adversely affected by significant charges for plant demolition and pension plan termination costs 

purchases from affiliates totaled 493 million in 2010 454 million in 2009 and 363 million in 2008 the majority of which related to a distributorship agreement with daikyo which allows us to purchase and resell daikyo products sales to affiliates were 24 million 19 million and 17 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

income from continuing operations 

income from continuing operations in 2010 was 653 million a decrease of 73 million over 2009 diluted earnings per share in 2010 were 189 a decrease of 023 per diluted share compared with the prioryear earnings our 2010 results included the impact of restructuring charges and asset impairments of 102 million net of 57 million in tax income from the reduction of acquisitionrelated contingencies of 16 million net of 02 million in tax and the recognition of income tax benefits totaling 11 million the majority of which resulted from the reversal of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 

  

income from continuing operations in 2009 was 726 million a decrease of 134 million over 2008 diluted earnings per share for 2009 were 212 a yearoveryear decrease of 038 per diluted share our 2009 results included the impact of restructuring charges and asset impairments of 63 million net of 32 million in tax and income tax benefits totaling 61 million primarily relating to reversals of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and the identification of additional qualified rd activities related to prior years 

income from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders in 2008 was 860 million or 250 per diluted share our 2008 results included a net gain on contract settlement proceeds of 27 million net of 15 million in tax restructuring and related charges of 19 million net of 11 million in tax and income tax benefits of 35 million the majority of which related to the reversal of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow activity 

the following table and explanations provide cash flow data from continuing operations for the years ended december 31 

 

cash flows from operating activities – our 2010 operating cash flows increased 06 million compared to the prior year as a result of favorable variances in other assets and liabilities including lower cash paid for taxes in 2010 

our 2009 operating cash flows increased 27 million compared to the prior year the lower net income in 2009 net of an increased amount of noncash charges such as depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation was more than offset by favorable variances in other assets and liabilities including lower cash paid for taxes in 2009 compared with the prior year included in 2009 net cash provided by operating activities was a 100 million voluntary contribution to our us qualified pension plan compared with no contributions made during 2008 included in 2008 operating cash flow was a 127 million payment for income tax and other taxrelated issues in brazil 

cash flows from investing activities – cash used in investing activities was significantly lower than the 2009 amount as a result of lower capital spending and reduced spending on business acquisitions cash paid for business acquisitions in 2009 which included the éris safety syringe acquisition was 132 million higher than cash paid for businesses acquired in 2010 capital spending in 2010 totaled 711 million which was a 338 million decrease from the prior year due primarily to the 2009 completion of several significant capital projects packaging systems’ 2010 capital spending was 489 million a decrease of 359 million from the prior year which was attributable to the third quarter 2009 completion of our new plastics plant in china our european plants’ expansion project and the implementation of new planning and manufacturing information systems in north america 2010 capital spending for the delivery systems segment was 163 million which was 23 million below the level of spending in the prior year 

capital spending in 2009 totaled 1049 million a 337 million decrease from the 2008 amount packaging systems spending was 848 million a decrease of 327 million from 2008 resulting from the completion of several major plant expansion projects that began during 2008 and were placed into service during 2009 in the aggregate we spent 299 million less for capital expansion projects in 2009 compared to 2008 a portion of which was the result of discretionary reductions in spending as we postponed certain components of our expansion plans in response to the recessionary impacts on market demand also contributing to the decrease was a reduction in accrued capital spending delivery systems’ 2009 capital spending was 186 million an increase of 51 million compared to the 2008 amount 

  

cash flows from financing activities – the yearoveryear increase in cash used for financing activities was primarily the result of a larger amount of debt repayments in 2010 compared to 2009 cash flows used in financing activities for 2010 included 160 million in net repayment of borrowings and debt issue costs compared with combined net debt repayments of 102 million in 2009 the majority of debt repayments in both years was attributable to borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

for 2009 the yearoveryear decrease in cash used for financing activities was the result of payments made in 2008 to acquire the remaining noncontrolling interest 10 in our medimop subsidiaries partially offset by a larger amount of debt repayment and higher dividend payments in 2009 compared to 2008 cash flows used in financing activities for 2009 included 59 million in net repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and 43 million in payments of shortterm notes and capital leases compared with combined net debt repayments of 92 million in 2008 

we paid cash dividends totaling 217 million 065 per share during 2010 compared to 201 million 061 per share and 186 million 057 per share in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

the table below displays selected liquidity and capital measures for west as of december 31 

 

cash equivalents include shortterm investments having maturities of ninety days or less when purchased working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities 

working capital at december 31 2010 increased 408 million compared with the balance at december 31 2009 reflecting higher cash and cash equivalents of 271 million and increased inventories in the amount of 178 million net of foreign currency effects the change in inventory balances was primarily due to higher raw materials costs an increase in goodsintransit due to timing of raw materials purchases from suppliers and a yearoveryear build in finished goods corresponding with higher orders onhand at december 31 2010 compared with the prior yearend included in working capital at december 31 2010 and 2009 was cash held in escrow representing judicial deposits for the government of brazil related to various tax positions taken in prior years and the related tax liabilities the escrow balance recorded in other current assets at december 31 2010 was 117 million which will be used to settle our outstanding taxrelated obligations of 72 million also recorded within working capital as a result of the 2009 brazil tax amnesty program we estimate that 45 million in excess deposits will be returned to us as the underlying tax cases are settled 

in june 2010 we entered into a fouryear multicurrency revolving credit facility agreement which replaced a prior revolving credit facility which was due to expire in 2011 the new credit agreement contains a 2250 million committed credit facility and an accordion feature under which the credit facility may be increased to 2750 million the interest rate is variable determined by reference to libor currently 026 plus a margin ranging from 175 to 275 percentage points determined by our leverage ratio in june 2010 we used borrowings of 266 million under the new credit facility to repay all amounts outstanding under the prior credit agreement which was then terminated as of december 31 2010 we had 122 million in outstanding borrowings under this new credit facility which was classified as longterm debt based upon our intent and ability to continue the loans beyond one year during the fourth quarter we had an average outstanding balance of 185 million under our revolving credit facility total debt decreased 212 million for the year as a result of repayments of 143 million and from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of 69 million 

  

based on our business outlook and our current capital structure we believe that we have ample liquidity to fund our business needs new product development capital expansion pension and other postretirement benefits and to pay dividends we may also use our liquidity from time to time to repay debt fund acquisitions repurchase shares for treasury and to make other investments we expect that our cash requirements for the next twelve months will be met primarily through our cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents on hand and amounts available under our multicurrency revolving credit facility as of december 31 2010 we had available 2102 million of borrowing capacity under this facility and we have not experienced any limit on our ability to access this source of funds 

we are required by the financial covenants in our debt agreements to maintain established interest coverage ratios and to not exceed established leverage ratios in addition the agreements contain other customary covenants none of which we consider restrictive to our operations as of the date of this report we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants 

commitments and contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments at december 31 2010 these obligations are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

reserves for uncertain tax positions  the table above does not include 50 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately 04 million of associated accrued interest as of december 31 2010 due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for amounts which may be paid 

letters of credit  we have letters of credit totaling 26 million supporting the reimbursement of workers’ compensation and other claims paid on our behalf by insurance carriers and to guarantee equipment lease payments in ireland and the payment of sales tax liabilities in the us the accrual for insurance obligations was 85 million at december 31 2010 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2010 the company had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases unconditional purchase obligations outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs and leased equipment and sales tax liability guarantees all incurred in the ordinary course of business 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with us gaap the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions some of which are subjective and complex that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our results of operations and financial position 

revenue recognition  the majority of our revenue within both segments is generated from product manufacturing operations and sales directly to our customers we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss passes to the customer which may be upon shipment or upon delivery to the customer site based upon shipping terms or legal requirements we offer volume rebates to certain customers as sales incentives provisions for rebates as well as sales discounts and allowances are accounted for as a reduction of sales when revenue is recorded we estimate rebates based on our assessment of the likelihood that required volumes will be attained using available information including historical experience we generally are able to ensure that products meet customer specifications prior to shipment we establish product return liabilities for customer quality claims when such liabilities are deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 

impairment of longlived assets    we review goodwill and other longlived assets annually and whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment as part of the reporting unit to which it belongs our reporting units are the same as or one level below our operating segments which are defined as the americas europe and asia pacific divisions of the packaging systems segment and the americas and europe divisions of our delivery systems segment for assets held and used in the business management estimates the future cash flows to be derived from the related asset or business unit when assets are held for sale management determines fair value by estimating the anticipated proceeds to be received upon the sale of the asset less disposition costs changes in the estimate of fair value including the estimate of future cash flows could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position 

  

employee benefits  we maintain funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans in the us and a number of other countries that cover employees that meet eligibility requirements in addition we sponsor postretirement benefit plans which provide healthcare benefits for eligible employees who retire or become disabled the measurement of annual cost and obligations under these defined benefit postretirement plans is subject to a number of assumptions which are specific for each of our us and foreign plans the assumptions which are reviewed at least annually are relevant to both the plan assets where applicable and the obligation for benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees two of the most critical assumptions in determining pension and retiree medical plan expense are the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement age rates of compensation increases mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience for our funded plans we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our plan assets as well as historical and expected rates of return in estimating the longterm rate of return on plan assets under us gaap differences between actual and expected results are generally accumulated in other comprehensive income loss as actuarial gains or losses and subsequently amortized into earnings over future periods 

changes in key assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position we estimate that every 25 basis point reduction in our longterm rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by 05 million and every 25 basis point reduction in our discount rate would increase pension expense by 07 million a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations our net pension underfunded balance at december 31 2010 was 712 million compared to 691 million at december 31 2009 our underfunded balance for other postretirement benefits was 181 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 

income taxes  we estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation in addition deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established to recognize differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities we maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized the recoverability of tax assets is subject to our estimates of future profitability generally at the respective subsidiary company and country level changes in tax legislation business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined 

when accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements we apply a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 

please refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies and note 17 new accounting standards  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on accounting and reporting standards considered in the preparation and presentation of our financial statements 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risk factors such as fluctuating interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and increasing commodity prices these risk factors can impact our results of operations cash flows and financial position to manage these risks we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps call options and forward exchange contracts for periods consistent with and for notional amounts equal to or less than the underlying exposures in accordance with company policy derivative financial instruments are not used for speculation or trading purposes 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have subsidiaries outside the us accounting for over 50 of consolidated net sales virtually all of these sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into us dollars for consolidated reporting purposes although the majority of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary they may also hold assets or liabilities denominated in other currencies these items may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains and losses as a result our results of operations and financial position are exposed to changing currency exchange rates we periodically use forward contracts to hedge certain transactions or to neutralize monthend balance sheet exposures on crosscurrency intercompany loans 

we have designated our €815 million eurodenominated notes as a hedge of our investment in the net assets of our european operations we also have a 10 billion yendenominated note payable which has been designated as a hedge of our investment in a japanese affiliate at december 31 2010 a cumulative foreign currency translation loss on these net investment hedges of 58 million net of tax of 36 million was recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income 

interest rate risk 

as a result of our normal borrowing activities we have longterm debt with both fixed and variable interest rates longterm debt consists of senior notes convertible debentures revolving credit facilities and capital lease obligations our exposures to fluctuations in interest rates are managed to the extent considered necessary by entering into interest rate swap agreements 

the following table summarizes our interest rate risksensitive instruments 

 

1 as of december 31 2010 we have two interest rate swap agreements outstanding which are designed to protect against volatility in variable interest rates payable on a 500 million note maturing on july 28 2012 “series a note” and a 250 million note maturing july 28 2015 “series b note” the first interestrate swap agreement has a notional amount of 500 million and corresponds to the maturity date of the series a note and the second interest rate swap has a notional amount of 250 million and corresponds with the maturity date of the series b note under each of the swap agreements we will receive variable interest rate payments based on threemonth libor in return for making quarterly fixed payments the interestrate swap agreements effectively fix the interest rates payable on our series a and b notes at 532 and 551 respectively at december 31 2010 the interest rateswap agreements had a fair value of 61 million unfavorable to the company and were recorded as a noncurrent liability 

  

commodity price risk 

many of our packaging systems products are made from synthetic elastomers which are derived from the petroleum refining process we purchase the majority of our elastomers via longterm supply contracts some of which contain clauses that provide for surcharges related to changes in crude oil prices in december 2009 we purchased a series of crude oil call options which were intended to reduce our exposure to increases in oilbased surcharges and protect operating cash flows with regard to a portion of our forecasted elastomer purchases during the months of july through december 2010 these call options capped our cost of the crude oil component of elastomer prices for a portion of our forecasted purchases allowing us to limit our exposure to increasing petroleum prices these call options were not designated as hedging instruments as of december 31 2010 there were no options outstanding 

  




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a  controls and procedures 

disclosure controls are controls and procedures designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the exchange act such as this annual report is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the us securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms disclosure controls include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended is accumulated and communicated to our management including our ceo and cfo or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure our disclosure controls include some but not all components of our internal control over financial reporting 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that as of december 31 2010 our disclosure controls and procedures are effective 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 based on the framework established in “internal controlintegrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2010 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within west have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein 

  

changes in internal controls 

during the fourth quarter ended december 31 2010 there have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

business segments 

during the years presented our business was conducted through two reportable segments pharmaceutical systems and tech group comparative segment revenues and related financial information for 2009 2008 and 2007 are presented in a table contained in note 6 segment information to our consolidated financial statements and are discussed within results of operations in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of this 2009 form 10k intersegment sales are eliminated in consolidation 

pharmaceutical systems segment 

our pharmaceutical systems segment designs manufactures and sells a variety of packaging components and systems used in parenteral drug delivery for the pharmaceutical biopharmaceutical and generic industries the primary components we manufacture are subject to regulatory oversight within our customers’ manufacturing facilities we have manufacturing facilities in north and south america europe and asia pacific with affiliated companies in mexico and japan see item 2 properties    for additional information on our manufacturing sites 

our pharmaceutical systems segment consists of two operating segments — americas and europeasia pacific — which are aggregated for reporting purposes because they have similar economic characteristics as well as similar products manufacturing processes customer objectives distribution procedures and regulatory requirements 

our pharmaceutical systems business is composed of the following product lines 

pharmaceutical packaging 

 

 

 

 

 

 

disposable medical components 

 

 

 

 

 

safety and administration systems 

 

  

  

 

laboratory and other services 

 

sales of pharmaceutical packaging components represented approximately 60 59 and 57 of consolidated net sales for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively disposable medical components sales as a percent of consolidated net sales were 10 10 and 12 for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

products and services recently brought to market are the daikyo crystal zenith luer lock syringe envisionand the west ready pack system the daikyo crystal zenith syringe is the market’s first siliconefree readytouse prefillable syringe that offers pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies a total system solution that can mitigate the risks associated with glass syringes crystal zenith technology is licensed from daikyo seiko ltd west’s envision components plungers and stoppers are inspected by an automated vision inspection system to ensure they meet enhanced quality specifications for visible and subvisible particulate and contamination the west ready pack system is a onesource solution ideal for pharmaceutical research and development and clinical work each system comes with west stoppers flipoff seals and vials conveniently packaged in small volumes because the components are delivered readytouse component preparation is eliminated from the customer’s processing saving them time and money 

our tamperevident flipoff seals consist of a metal overseal and a molded plastic cap that is removed in order to permit needle access to the drugvial contents these are sold in a wide range of sizes and colors to meet customers’ needs for product identification and differentiation the seals can be provided using proprietary printing and embossing technology for multiple layers of protection such as pointofuse instructions itemlevel information such as vial contents drug dosage and strength and cautionary statements that can serve as counterfeiting deterrence 

elastomeric components are offered in a variety of standard and customerspecific configurations and formulations and are available with advanced barrier films and coatings to enhance their performance west flurotec® coating is a film that is applied using a patented molding process to reduce the risk of product loss by contamination enhance seal integrity and protect the shelf life of packaged drugs we also apply a teflon® coating to the surface of stoppers and plungers to improve compatibility between the closure and the drug b2coating is a coating applied to the surface of stoppers and plungers using a patented process that eliminates the need for conventional silicone application it helps manufacturers reduce product rejections due to trace levels of silicone molecules found in noncoated packaged drug compounds flurotec and b2coating technologies are licensed from daikyo seiko ltd 

our verisure components are an example of how laboratory services can be combined with a product offering these components allow pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies to navigate the complex task of extractables identification and the related analysis for qualifying a drug product’s containerclosure system more efficiently the customer will receive a certificate of analysis with each shipment of components also with a known extractables profile customers can begin the design of leachables studies on a quicker basis a process which our analytical laboratory services can support 

in addition our postmanufacturing processes westar rs and westar ru are documented and fully validated procedures for washing and siliconizing stoppers and syringe components to remove biological materials and endotoxins westar rs prepares components for introduction into the customer’s sterilizer and westar ru provides sterilized components the westar processes increase the overall efficiency of injectable drug production by outsourcing component processing thereby eliminating steps otherwise required in each of our customers’ manufacturing processes and assure compliance with the latest regulatory requirements for component preparation 

  

  

medimop medical projects ltd “medimop” one of our wholly owned subsidiaries is a leader in the world market for transfer mixing and administration systems for injectable pharmaceuticals many injectable drug products are produced as freezedried powders in order to preserve product efficacy during shipment and storage these products must be reconstituted typically by diluting the powder with sterile water or other diluent at the point of use all medimop products marketed in the united states are cleared by the us food and drug administration fda in addition many medimop products are protected by patents 

as an adjunct to our pharmaceutical systems products we offer contract analytical laboratory services for testing and evaluating primary drug packaging components and their compatibility with the contained drug formulation west analytical services provides us and our customers with indepth knowledge and analysis of the interaction and compatibility of drug products with elastomer glass and plastic packaging components our analytical laboratories also provide specialized testing for complete drug delivery systems 

tech group segment 

our tech group segment is a global custom injection molder with over 40 years of experience offering contract manufacturing solutions for the healthcare and consumer industries this segment has manufacturing operations in the us puerto rico and ireland see item 2 properties  for additional information on our manufacturing sites 

our tech group segment consists of two operating segments — americas and europe — which are aggregated for reporting purposes because they have similar economic characteristics as well as similar products manufacturing processes customer objectives distribution procedures and regulatory requirements 

the tech group is committed to producing the highest quality injection molded components and devices which include unique components for surgical ophthalmic diagnostic and drug delivery systems such as contact lens storage kits pill dispensers and disposable blood collection systems as well as various personal care and consumer products the tech group’s record of success includes manufacturing and assembly of systems and devices used for nasal oral pulmonary and injectable delivery of drugs used to treat diseases affecting people around the world 

sales of healthcare devices represent approximately 17 16 and 18 of consolidated net sales for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

the tech group segment also has expertise in product design and development including inhouse mold design and construction an engineering center for developmental and prototype tooling process design and validation and highspeed automated assemblies technologies include multicomponent molding inmold labeling ultrasonic welding and clean room molding and device assembly 

our confidose® autoinjector system enhances patient compliance and safety with confidose the needle remains shielded at all times and retracts automatically after the injection the system eliminates preparation steps and automates the injection of drugs providing patients with a sterile singleuse disposable system that can be readily used at home the tech group segment is responsible for manufacturing and assembling commercial quantities of this system 

2010 business operations realignment 

on december 15 2009 our board of directors approved a realignment of our business operations into two new divisions “pharmaceutical packaging systems” and “pharmaceutical delivery systems” effective january 1 2010 pharmaceutical packaging systems will focus on primary container solutions including components for drug packaging and prefillable syringe systems the division will consist of our core pharmaceutical packaging products disposable medical components and laboratory and other services the growth strategy for the pharmaceutical packaging systems division includes organic growth through market segmentation newproduct innovation strategic acquisitions and geographic expansion 

  

  

the pharmaceutical delivery systems division will focus on safety and administration systems and multicomponent systems for drug administration it will consist of the injectionmolding and assembly business from the current tech group segment advanced injection systems and other innovationrelated products and businesses we intend to pursue growth in the pharmaceutical delivery systems division through the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications 

restructuring initiatives 

in december 2007 our board of directors approved a restructuring plan for the tech group in an effort to align our plant capacity and workforce with the revised business outlook and longerterm strategy of focusing the business on proprietary products as part of this plan we implemented a series of initiatives to reduce operating costs and increase the manufacturing efficiency of the segment we incurred a total of 75 million in restructuring and related charges as part of this plan through its completion in june 2009 

in november 2009 we announced restructuring plans for certain business operations and support functions affecting both of our reporting segments the pharmaceutical systems plan involves exiting certain specialized laboratory service offerings due to a change in market demand reducing support personnel primarily associated with information technology applications and discontinuing other noncore initiatives and disposing of the associated assets the tech group plan is intended to better align our available production capacity with expected levels of contract manufacturing activity by consolidating manufacturing operations and support functions we expect to incur approximately 90 million in restructuring charges and eliminate an estimated 100 positions as part of these plans during 2009 pharmaceutical systems incurred actual charges of 70 million and tech group incurred charges of 06 million with the balance expected to be incurred through 2010 as the associated activities are completed for additional details see note 4 restructuring and other items  to our consolidated financial statements 

international 

we have significant operations outside the us they are managed through the same business segments as our us operations – pharmaceutical systems and tech group sales outside of the us account for approximately 52 of consolidated net sales for a geographic breakdown of sales see the table in note 6 segment information to the consolidated financial statements 

although the general business processes are similar to the domestic business international operations are exposed to additional risks these risks include currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar multiple tax jurisdictions and particularly in latin and south america and israel political and social issues that could destabilize local markets and affect the demand for our products 

depending on the direction of change relative to the us dollar foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations see the discussion under the caption summary of significant accounting policies  foreign currency translation in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements we also have exposure to the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiary we attempt to minimize some of our exposure to these exchange rate fluctuations through the use of forward exchange contracts and foreign currency denominated debt this activity is generally discussed in note 1 under the caption summary of significant accounting policies – financial instruments and in note 14 derivative financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements in this 2009 form 10k 

raw materials 

 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers aluminum and plastic elastomers include both natural and synthetic materials we have access to adequate supplies of these raw materials to meet our production needs through agreements with suppliers 

 

  

  

we employ a supplychain management strategy in our reporting segments which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply this strategy has reduced the number of our raw material suppliers due to regulatory control over our production processes and the cost and time involved in qualifying suppliers we rely on singlesource suppliers for many critical raw materials this strategy increases the risk that our supply lines may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production problem these risks are managed where possible by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites rigid quality control systems surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in case of an interruption in production and therefore we foresee no significant availability problems in the near future 

intellectual property rights 

 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business we own or license numerous patents and have patent applications pending in the us and in other countries that relate to various aspects of our products in addition key valueadded and proprietary products and processes are licensed from our japanese affiliate daikyo seiko ltd our patents and other proprietary rights have been useful in establishing our market share and in the growth of our business and are expected to continue to be of value in the future as we continue to develop proprietary products although important in the aggregate we do not consider our business to be materially dependent on any individual patent 

 

we also rely heavily on trade secrets manufacturing knowhow and continuing technological innovations as well as inlicensing opportunities to maintain and further develop our competitive position particularly in the area of formulation development and tooling design 

seasonality 

 

although our pharmaceutical systems business is not inherently seasonal sales and operating profit in the second half of the year are typically lower than the first half primarily due to scheduled plant shutdowns in conjunction with our customers’ production schedules and the yearend impact of holidays on production during the shutdown periods maintenance procedures are performed and vacations are taken by production employees 

 

working capital 

 

we are required to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet customer requirements other agreements also require us to purchase inventory in bulk orders which increases inventory levels but decreases the risk of supply interruption levels of inventory are also influenced by the seasonal patterns addressed above for a more detailed discussion of working capital please see the discussion in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resource s 

 

marketing 

 

our pharmaceutical systems customers include practically every major branded pharmaceutical generic and biopharmaceutical company in the world pharmaceutical systems components and other products are sold to major pharmaceutical biotechnology and hospital supplymedical device companies which incorporate them into their products for distribution to the ultimate enduser 

 

with extensive experience in contract manufacturing our tech group segment sells to many of the world’s largest medical device and pharmaceutical companies and to large customers in the personal care and foodandbeverage industries tech group components generally are incorporated into our customers’ manufacturing lines for further processing or assembly west’s products and services are distributed primarily through our own sales force and distribution network with limited use of contract sales agents and regional distributors 

 

our ten largest customers accounted for 383 of our consolidated net sales in 2009 but not one of these customers individually accounted for more than 10 of net sales 

  

  

order backlog 

at december 31 2009 our order backlog was 2387 million most of which is expected to be filled during fiscal year 2010 the order backlog was 2301 million at the end of 2008 the increase is primarily due to foreign currency translation order backlog includes firm orders placed by customers for manufacture over a period of time according to their schedule or upon confirmation by the customer we also have contractual arrangements with a number of our customers and products covered by these contracts are included in our backlog only as orders are received 

 

competition 

 

we compete with several companies across our pharmaceutical systems product lines however we believe that we supply a major portion of the us market for pharmaceutical elastomer and metal packaging components and have a significant share of the european market for these components because of the special nature of our pharmaceutical packaging components and our longstanding participation in the market competition is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive costcontrol programs across their operations 

 

we differentiate ourselves from our competition as a fullservice valueadded global supplier that can provide presale formula and engineering development analytical services regulatory expertise and postmanufacturing technologies as well as aftersale technical support customers also appreciate the global scope of west’s manufacturing capability and our ability to produce many products at multiple sites 

 

our tech group business is in very competitive markets for both healthcare and consumer products the competition varies from smaller regional companies to large global molders that command significant market shares there are extreme cost pressures and many of our customers look offshore to reduce cost we differentiate ourselves by leveraging our global capability and by employing new technologies such as highspeed automated assembly insertmolding multishot molding and expertise with multiplepiece closure systems because of the more demanding regulatory requirements in the medical device component area there are a smaller number of other competitors mostly largescale companies we compete for this market on the basis of our reputation for quality and reliability in engineering and project management diverse contract manufacturing capabilities and knowledge of and experience in complying with fda requirements 

 

research and development activities 

we maintain our own researchscale production facilities and laboratories for developing new products and offer contract engineering design and development services to assist customers with new product development our quality control regulatory and laboratory testing capabilities are used to ensure compliance with applicable manufacturing and regulatory standards for primary and secondary pharmaceutical packaging components the engineering departments are responsible for product and tooling design and testing and for the design and construction of processing equipment the primary responsibility of our innovation group is seeking new opportunities in injectable packaging and delivery systems most of which will be manufactured by our tech group segment and marketed by our pharmaceutical systems segment research and development spending will continue to increase as we pursue innovative strategic platforms in prefillable syringe injectable container advanced injection and safety and administration systems 

 

we spent 180 million in 2009 172 million in 2008 and 140 million in 2007 on research and development for the pharmaceutical systems segment the tech group segment incurred research and development expenses of 19 million 15 million and 21 million in the years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

commercial development of our new products and services for medical and pharmaceutical applications commonly requires several years new products that we develop may require separate approval as medical devices and products that are intended to be used in packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical products will be subject to both customer acceptance of our products and regulatory approval of the customer’s products following our development period 

  

  

environmental regulations 

we are subject to various federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in fiscal year 2009 and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes in fiscal year 2010 

employees 

as of december 31 2009 we employed 6408 people in our operations throughout the world

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 

the current uncertainty in the global economy including the continuing effects of recession or slow economic growth in the us europe and asia may negatively affect our operating results examples of the effects of these continuing global economic challenges include our suppliers’ and our customers’ inability to access the credit markets at commercially reasonable rates reduction in sales due to customers decreasing their inventories in the nearterm or longterm or due to liquidity difficulties reduction in sales due to shortages of materials we purchase from our suppliers reduction in research and development efforts and expenditures by our customers our inability to hedge our currency and raw material risks sufficiently or at commercially reasonable prices insolvency of suppliers or customers inflationary pressures on our supplies or our products and increased expenses due to growing taxation of corporate profits or revenues our operating results in one or more geographic regions may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in the us europe or asia remain uncertain or weaken further we may experience material adverse impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

  

we are exposed to credit risk on accounts receivable and certain prepayments made in the normal course of business this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

a substantial majority of our outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance in addition we have made prepayments associated with insurance premiums and other advances in the normal course of business while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on trade receivables and other current assets there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk and avoid losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values and the risk of loss of our investment portfolio 

our available cash and cash equivalents are held in bank deposits money market funds and other shortterm investments we have funds in our operating accounts that are with thirdparty financial institutions these balances in the us may exceed the fdic federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits while we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the balances as appropriate we could lose this cash or be unable to withdraw it in a timely manner if the underlying financial institutions fail although we have not recognized any material losses on our cash cash equivalents and other cash investments future declines in their market values or other unexpected losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

our sales and profitability depend to a large extent on the sale of drug products delivered by injection if the products developed by our customers in the future use another delivery system our sales and profitability could suffer 

our business depends to a substantial extent on customers continued sales and development of products that are delivered by injection if our customers fail to continue to sell develop and deploy new injectable products or we are unable to develop new products that assist in the delivery of drugs by alternative methods our sales and profitability may suffer 

if we are unable to provide comparative value advantages timely fulfillment of customer orders or resist pricing pressure we will have to reduce our prices which may negatively impact our profit margins 

we compete with several companies across our major product lines because of the special nature of these products competition is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive cost control programs across their entire operations competitors often compete on the basis of price we differentiate ourselves from our competition as a fullservice valueadded supplier that is able to provide presale compatibility studies and other services and sophisticated postsale technical support on a global basis however we face continued pricing pressure from our customers and competitors if we are unable to resist or to offset the effects of continued pricing pressure through our valueadded services improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures or if we have to reduce our prices our sales and profitability may suffer 

if we are unable to expand our production capacity at our european and asian facilities there may be a delay in fulfilling or we may be unable to fulfill customer orders and this could potentially reduce our sales and our profitability may suffer 

we have significant indebtedness and debt service payments which could negatively impact our liquidity 

we owe substantial debts and have to commit significant cash flow to debt service requirements the level of our indebtedness among other things could 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to reduce our total indebtedness depends on the results of our product development efforts our future operating performance our ability to generate cash flow from the sale of our products and on general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors affecting our operations many of these factors are beyond our control and our future operating performance could be adversely affected by some or all of these factors 

if we incur new indebtedness in the future the related risks that we now face could intensify whether we are able to make required payments on our outstanding indebtedness and satisfy any other future debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance and our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing 

our intellectual property assets may not prevent competitive offerings 

our patents trademarks and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to ours nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by us to protect our intellectual property will be sufficient or that our intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of our technology in addition we may be the target of aggressive enforcement of patents held by third parties any litigation regarding our intellectual property rights could be timeconsuming and costly and the results could be unpredictable 

we are subject to regulation by governments around the world and if these regulations are not complied with existing and future operations may be curtailed and we could be subject to liability 

the design development manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our products and our customers’ products that incorporate our products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the us europe and other countries including the fda and the european medicines agency the regulatory process can result in required modification or withdrawal of existing products and a substantial delay in the introduction of new products also it is possible that regulatory approval may not be obtained for a new product in addition our analytical laboratories perform certain contract services for drug manufacturers and are subject to the fdas current good manufacturing practices regulations we must also register as a contract laboratory with the fda and are subject to periodic inspections by the fda the drug enforcement administration has licensed our contract analytical laboratories to handle and store controlled substances failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in actions that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our business may be adversely affected by changes in the regulation of drug products and devices 

an effect of the governmental regulation of our customers’ drug products devices and manufacturing processes is that compliance with regulations makes it costly and timeconsuming for customers to substitute or replace components and devices produced by one supplier with those from another in general terms regulation of our customers’ products that incorporate our components and devices has increased over time however if the applicable regulations were to be modified in a way that reduced the cost and time involved for customers to substitute one supplier’s components or devices for those made by another it is likely that the competitive pressure on us would increase and adversely affect our sales and profitability 

  

  

our business may be adversely affected by risks typically encountered in international operations 

we conduct business in most of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world sales outside the us account for approximately 52 of consolidated net sales virtually all of these sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into us dollars which can result in significant increases or decreases in the amount of those sales or earnings the main currencies to which we are exposed besides the us dollar are the euro british pound danish krone and singapore dollar the exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future in addition to translation risks we incur currency transaction gains or losses when we or one of our subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction in a currency other than that entity’s local currency 

international operations are also exposed to the following risks transportation delays and interruptions political and economic instability and disruptions imposition of duties and tariffs import and export controls the risks of divergent business expectations or cultural incompatibility inherent in establishing and maintaining operations in foreign countries difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations labor strikes andor disputes and potentially adverse tax consequences limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies with third parties or our joint venture partners outside of the us could also create exposure in addition we may not be able to operate in compliance with foreign laws and regulations or comply with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject in the event that these laws or regulations change 

any of these events could have an adverse effect on our international operations in the future by reducing the demand for our products decreasing the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

raw material and energy prices have a significant impact on our profitability if raw material andor energy prices increase and we cannot pass those price increases on to our customers our profitability and financial condition may suffer 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers which include synthetic and natural material aluminum and plastic in addition our manufacturing facilities consume a wide variety of energy products to fuel heat and cool our operations supply and demand factors which are beyond our control generally affect the price of our raw materials and utility costs if we are unable to pass along increased raw material prices and energy costs to our customers our profitability and thus our financial condition may be adversely affected the prices of many of these raw materials and utilities are cyclical and volatile for example the prices of certain commodities particularly petroleumbased raw materials have in the recent past exhibited rapid changes increasing the cost of synthetic elastomers and plastic while we generally attempt to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of sales price increases historically there has been a time delay between raw material andor energy price increases and our ability to increase the prices of our products in some circumstances we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pressure and other factors 

disruptions in the supply of key raw materials and difficulties in the supplier qualification process could adversely impact our operations 

we employ a supply chain management strategy in our reporting segments which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply this strategy has reduced the number of raw material suppliers used by us this increases the risk that our supply lines may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production problem or financial difficulties if one of our suppliers is unable to supply materials needed for our products or our strategies for managing these risks are unsuccessful we may be unable to complete the process of qualifying new replacement materials for some programs in time to meet future production needs prolonged disruptions in the supply of any of our key raw materials difficulty completing qualification of new sources of supply or in implementing the use of replacement materials or new sources of supply could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition or cash flows 

  

  

our operations must comply with environmental statutes and regulations and any failure to comply could result in extensive costs which would harm our business 

the manufacture of some of our products involves the use transportation storage and disposal of hazardous or toxic materials and is subject to various environmental protection and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate this has exposed us in the past and could expose us in the future to risks of accidental contamination and events of noncompliance with environmental laws any such occurrences could result in regulatory enforcement or personal injury and property damage claims or could lead to a shutdown of some of our operations which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations we currently incur costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations and these costs may become more significant 

a loss of key personnel or highly skilled employees could disrupt our operations 

our executive officers are critical to the management and direction of our businesses our future success depends in large part on our ability to retain these officers and other capable management personnel with the exception of our chief executive officer in general we do not enter into employment agreements with our executive officers we have entered into severance agreements with our officers that allow those officers to terminate their employment under particular circumstances such as a change of control affecting our company although we believe that we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise our inability to do so could disrupt the operations of the unit affected or our overall operations in addition because of the complex nature of many of our products and programs we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled engineering staff and workforce our operations could be disrupted by a shortage of available skilled employees 

the disruption of our normal business activities as a result of the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system and updates to shop floor systems could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

during the second quarter of 2008 we successfully replaced our financial reporting cash disbursement and ordertocash systems in our north american operations with a new enterprise resource planning “erp” system phase two of the erp project which focused on the replacement of planning and manufacturing systems as well as updates to shop floor systems commenced in late 2008 and was completed in the fourth quarter of 2009 

our erp system is critical to our ability to accurately and efficiently maintain our books and records record transactions provide critical information to our management and prepare our financial statements we have invested significant capital and human resources in the design and implementation of this system the inability of the erp and shop floor systems to work as anticipated could adversely affect our ability to process and ship orders provide services and customer support bill and track customers fulfill contractual obligations and file quarterly or annual reports with the sec in a timely manner the resulting disruptions to our business could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our acquisition strategy may not yield the expected benefits 

we are always analyzing our prospects for growth by acquisition of companies or other entities with developing technology and other assets that we believe would be helpful to our growth and profit the integration of any or all completed or planned acquisitions may not be successful the tax and other benefits expected from the acquisitions that we have entered into or may enter into may not materialize due to changes in applicable laws or regulations uncertainties in the application of laws or regulations or the inability to achieve expected levels of sales and operating profit 

  

  

our recent realignment of our business units may not deliver the expected growth 

effective january 1 2010 we realigned our business operations into two divisions “pharmaceutical packaging systems” and “pharmaceutical delivery systems” our new pharmaceutical delivery systems division plans to pursue growth through the development and commercialization of proprietary multicomponent systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications although we believe that this effort will be successful this division’s growth could suffer if proprietary systems cannot be developed quickly enough or on a costefficient basis or if they are not of sufficient commercial value growth in this division could also suffer as a result of soft demand by our customers or if anticipated markets for these products do not develop additionally our pharmaceutical delivery systems division will be subject to further regulatory oversight than our business has historically been subject to and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to successfully meet the new regulatory obligations in a commercially reasonable manner 

the uncertain effects of potential climate change legislation could lead to significantly increased costs 

if legislation or regulations are enacted or promulgated in the us europe or asia or any other jurisdictions in which we do business that limit or reduce allowable greenhouse gas emissions and other emissions such restrictions could have a significant effect on our operating and financial decisions including those involving capital expenditures to reduce emissions and our results of operations our manufacturing operations may not be able to operate as planned if we are not able to comply with new legal and regulatory legislation around climate change or it may become too costly to operate in a profitable manner additionally suppliers’ added expenses could be passed on to us in the form of higher prices and we may not be able to pass on such expenses to our customers through price increases 

the uncertain effects of potential healthcare legislation in the us could lead to significantly increased costs and other unforeseen consequences 

political economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the us to potential fundamental changes the effects of this potential legislation and any regulations that emanate from it are uncertain at this time however based on drafts of the legislation that have passed in the us senate and the us house of representatives and proposals put forth by the obama administration we expect that this potential reform could result in significant costs for us and also for our customers one proposal an excise tax on medical device companies may result in a significant increase in the tax burden on our new pharmaceutical delivery systems division in addition this reform may impose enhanced benefit requirements for our employees which could increase our labor costs significantly until legislation is final however the full range of consequences stemming from this reform is difficult to predict

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

company overview 

west pharmaceutical services inc which may be referred to as west  the company  we  us or our  is a manufacturer of components and systems for injectable drug delivery and plastic packaging and delivery system components for the pharmaceutical healthcare and consumer products industries the vast majority of our business is conducted in the pharmaceutical and healthcare markets our mission is to develop and apply proprietary technologies that improve the safety and effectiveness of therapeutic and diagnostic healthcare delivery systems during the years presented our business was conducted through two segments  pharmaceutical systems and tech group pharmaceutical systems focused on primary packaging and systems for injectable drug delivery including stoppers and seals for vials closures and other components used in syringe intravenous and blood collection systems prefillable syringe components and safety and administration systems the tech group offered custom contractmanufacturing solutions using plastic injection molding and manual and automated assembly processes targeted to the healthcare and consumer products industries as described in the recent developments section below beginning in 2010 we realigned our business operations into two new segments our customer base includes the leading global producers and distributors of pharmaceuticals biologics medical devices and personal care products we have a global manufacturing footprint with production and distribution facilities in north america europe latin america asia and australia west has also formed global partnerships to share technologies and market products with companies in japan and mexico 

as a result of our global manufacturing and distribution presence more than half of our revenues are generated outside of the us in currencies other than the us dollar including 44 in europe and 8 collectively in south america asia and australia in terms of net sales and operating profit the most significant foreign currencies are the euro the british pound the danish krone and the singapore dollar with eurodenominated sales representing the majority of sales transacted in foreign currencies for consolidated financial reporting purposes transactions and balances reported in foreign currencies must be translated into us dollars based upon applicable foreign currency exchange rates 

2009 financial performance highlights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

we achieved higher sales and gross profit in 2009 driven by the strong fourth quarter performance of our pharmaceutical systems segment despite the recessionary economic conditions and conservative ordering patterns from our customers we were successful in growing revenues by managing pricing improving sales mix and capitalizing on unique opportunities such as the h1n1 influenza vaccination effort sales volumes were not a significant contributor to growth in 2009 as our customers searched for ways to cut costs including lowering inventories on hand and delaying discretionary development projects however we grew revenue by converting customers to our higher value pharmaceutical packaging products that incorporate various postmanufacturing valueadded processes and advanced coatings that enhance quality minimize defects and incorporate the most rigorous regulatory standards increased production levels in the fourth quarter contributed to improved plant utilization and we also saw a return to favorable raw material prices compared with the exceptionally high prices experienced in the second half of 2008 and the majority of 2009 the tech group was most affected by economic conditions during 2009 as certain customers withdrew from new product launches reduced inventories on hand and curtailed purchases in line with lower consumer spending consolidated gross profit improved over the prior year as a result of increased demand in the fourth quarter and cost reduction efforts within both segments the effect of a significant increase in us pension costs unfavorable foreign currency translation and higher general and administrative costs within our operating segments resulted in lower operating profit for the year overall our pricing management improved sales mix and manufacturing cost reduction initiatives combined with lower cash paid for taxes outweighed the increased general and administrative costs during 2009 resulting in increased operating cash flows and a reduction in net debt 

recent developments 

acquisition 

on july 6 2009 we acquired certain business assets of plastef investissements sa “plastef” and its subsidiaries a francebased developer and manufacturer of drug delivery devices plastef’s products include the eris safety syringe system which addresses the market for fixedneedle prefilled syringes and complements our novaguard™ safety system which employs the other common syringe format luerlock syringes the acquired business assets included a manufacturing facility located at le vaudreuil normandy intellectual property and working capital the purchase price included cash paid at closing of 169 million funded from cash on hand and contingent consideration with a fair value of 26 million which is dependent upon the achievement of operating goals and other milestones over the next five years sales and operating results generated from the assets acquired from plastef are considered part of our tech group segment 

restructuring initiatives 

in december 2007 we launched a restructuring plan for our tech group which addressed changes in customers’ marketing plans for certain products and aligned our plant capacity and workforce with the longerterm strategy of focusing the business on proprietary products as part of this plan we implemented a series of restructuring initiatives to reduce production and engineering operations reduce administrative costs and consolidate our tool shops into one location during the first half of 2009 we incurred 11 million in costs as we completed these restructuring activities during 2008 and 2007 we incurred restructuring costs totaling 30 million and 34 million respectively in the aggregate costs of this program consisted of 37 million in severance and benefits 26 million in impairments and other assetrelated charges and 12 million for contract termination fees and other expenses 

in november 2009 we announced restructuring plans for certain business operations and support functions affecting both of our reporting segments the pharmaceutical systems plan involves exiting certain specialized laboratory service offerings due to a change in market demand reducing support personnel primarily associated with information technology applications and discontinuing other noncore initiatives and disposing of the associated assets the costs are estimated to be approximately 70 million which consists of 20 million in cash expenditures related to employee severance benefits and 50 million in asset impairment charges primarily related to removing certain laboratory equipment and plant assets from service annual savings from this portion of the plan are expected to be approximately 40 million including 10 million in reduced depreciation expense 

  

  

the tech group plan is intended to better align our available production capacity with expected levels of contract manufacturing activity by consolidating manufacturing operations and support functions total costs of the tech group plan are estimated to be approximately 20 million which consists of 15 million in cash expenditures for severance and asset relocation costs and 05 million in accelerated depreciation due to the shortened useful life of the affected fixed assets this portion of the plan is expected to generate savings of approximately 20 million in 2010 increasing to approximately 40 million annually following completion during 2009 pharmaceutical systems incurred actual charges of 70 million and tech group incurred charges of 06 million with the balance expected in 2010 as the respective activities are completed 

currency exchange rates 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant influence on our consolidated financial results in particular changes in the euro exchange rate have the greatest potential to impact results as euro denominated sales accounted for 37 of our consolidated sales and 71 of all nonus dollar denominated sales during 2009 and a similar amount in the prior two years in general our financial results are affected positively by a weaker us dollar and negatively by a stronger us dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business during 2009 on average the us dollar appreciated 52 against the euro and a combined 76 against other key currencies resulting in lower reported revenues of 325 million and reduced operating profit of 51 million versus the prior year 

for 2010 our projections currently anticipate that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will have a slightly favorable impact on consolidated sales and operating profit resulting from a depreciation of the us dollar relative to 2009 exchange rates 

us pension plan expense 

our expense for us pension and other postretirement benefits for 2009 was significantly higher than the prior year due primarily to the 2008 market decline in pension plan assets during 2008 the slowing economy and adverse conditions in equity and debt markets contributed to a 25 decline in the value of our us pension assets compared to a longterm rate of return assumption at the time of 80 as a result of this and other changes in key actuarial assumptions we experienced incremental expense of approximately 107 million during 2009 versus 2008 as shown in the results of operations section below us pension and other retirement plan expenses are considered a corporate cost and are not allocated to our reportable segments actual returns on our us pension plan assets during 2009 were significantly above our revised expected longterm rate of return of 775 and we expect our 2010 expense to be lower than the 2009 amount 

2010 business operations realignment 

effective january 1 2010 our business operations have been realigned into two new management divisions “pharmaceutical packaging systems” and “pharmaceutical delivery systems” in order to further align our business units with the underlying markets and customers they serve pharmaceutical packaging systems will consist of our core pharmaceutical packaging products disposable medical components and laboratory and other services pharmaceutical delivery systems will include safety and administration systems and multicomponent systems for drug administration most of which were manufactured by our tech group segment in addition the new pharmaceutical delivery systems segment will be responsible for the advancement of new delivery system products currently in development or earlystage marketing the majority of the costs for these development and marketing activities were previously included in the pharmaceutical systems segment beginning with the first quarter of 2010 this realignment will result in a change to our reportable segments and our historical results will be restated accordingly to provide comparative financial information 

  

  

2010 business outlook 

although we expect growth to continue to be hampered by a slow economic recovery our business outlook for 2010 is positive as we anticipate customers will revert to normal ordering patterns and begin to move development programs ahead we expect full year 2010 revenues to grow moderately driven by volume and mix improvement from our highvalue packaging product offerings safety and administration systems and the launch of certain innovation products a smaller portion of our 2010 growth is expected to come from selling price increases which will serve to offset anticipated increases in raw materials and other production costs pension costs will remain at relative high levels as a consequence of the plan asset losses experienced during the 2008 market decline although we expect some improvement from the 2009 expense we believe that the combination of higher revenues a better mix of product sales and a lower cost structure made possible by restructuring initiatives and aggressive lean savings initiatives at our production facilities will provide for growth in operating profit during 2010 

although there are a number of uncertainties that could impact our operating results such as continued consolidation of the pharmaceuticals industry the outcome of pending us healthcare legislation and continued recessionary pressures we believe that the longterm drivers remain strong and market dynamics support future growth with an aging population continued advances in treatments for chronic illnesses and increased regulatory scrutiny given our positive growth outlook we plan to continue funding the capital projects necessary to meet customer demand and to provide for improved results in our longerterm strategic plan during the last two years we made significant strides in increasing our plant capacity in germany serbia france singapore and the us and in 2009 we completed construction and commenced commercial production at our china plastic components facility during 2010 we expect that our capital spending will be between 115 million and 130 million and that it will continue to be heavily weighted toward new products and expansion projects as we plan to invest in a new rubbercomponents facility in china expand enhanced products capabilities in the us and europe fund innovation projects and implement various global quality initiatives 

results of operations 

management’s discussion and analysis of our operating results for the three years ended december 31 2009 and our financial position as of december 31 2009 should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes appearing in item 8 of this report on form 10k for the purpose of aiding the comparison of our yeartoyear results reference is made in managements discussion and analysis to results excluding the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates constant currency amounts are calculated by translating the current year’s functional currency results at the prior period’s exchange rate those remeasured period results on a constant currency basis are not in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “us gaap” and should not be used as a substitute for the related us gaap financial measures the nonus gaap financial measures are presented because management uses them in evaluating our results of operations and in comparing operating results to prior periods and believes that this information provides users a valuable insight into our results 

percentages in the following tables and throughout the results of operations section may reflect rounding adjustments 

net sales 

the following table summarizes net sales by reportable segment 

 

  

  

2009 compared to 2008 

consolidated 2009 net sales increased marginally over those achieved in the prior year including an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 325 million excluding foreign currency translation effects 2009 net sales increased 371 million or 35 from the prior year the increase was principally due to the favorable impact of annual selling price increases of 19 percentage points improved sales volume and mix of 07 percentage points and 09 percentage points resulting from our acquisition of plastef overall favorable sales results were attributable to pharmaceutical systems as the tech group sales were lower on unfavorable volume and mix and lower costadjusted selling prices as described below 

pharmaceutical systems  this segment contributed 166 million to the full year sales increase despite an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of 299 million excluding currency translation effects sales were 465 million or 59 above prioryear levels due mostly to higher selling prices and increased demand for our pharmaceutical packaging components sales of pharmaceutical packaging products excluding foreign currency changes during the year were 434 million higher than the prior year due to higher sales of stoppers used in packaging for various drugs including the h1n1 influenza vaccine and increased demand for prefilled injection packaging components used in insulin applications orders relating to the h1n1 vaccination effort resulted in an estimated 220 million of 2009 sales and are expected to contribute 150 million to 200 million less than this during 2010 also contributing to the increase in packaging components revenues was an increase in sales of flipoff seals mostly within north america sales of disposable medical components and safety and administration products were higher by approximately 22 million due mostly to the introduction of readytouse closures for intravenous bottles in south america the remainder of the increase in 2009 revenues came from other products and laboratory services sales which were 10 million higher than the prior year 

tech group  full year sales were 122 million below 2008 levels including 26 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation excluding the impact of foreign currency changes sales were 96 million or 35 below prior year levels sales of consumer and personal care products declined by 175 million compared to the prior year as a result of lower plastic resin costs which are contractually passed through to many tech group customers in the form of adjusted selling prices our decision to discontinue manufacturing a specific customer’s product in mexico and regulatory action which halted sales of one of our customer’s products the reduction in revenues caused by resin cost passthrough adjustments alone was approximately 64 million overall sales of healthcare devices tooling and other excluding foreign currency changes were 79 million higher compared with 2008 due to 102 million of incremental sales from our july 2009 acquisition of plastef and strong sales of an intranasal medical device manufactured in europe partially offset by lower us sales due to customer stock reductions and fewer new product introductions 

2008 compared to 2007 

consolidated 2008 net sales increased by 310 million or 30 over those achieved in the prior year favorable foreign currency translation accounted for the vast majority of the consolidated sales growth sales price increases contributed 23 percentage points to sales growth as price increases including raw material surcharges were implemented in response to rising raw material and energy costs during the year substantially offsetting the impact of sales price increases were lower volumes and unfavorable mix resulting from regulatory and insurance reimbursement related constraints and the discontinuation of certain products which resulted in lost sales within both reporting segments 

pharmaceutical systems  this segment contributed 503 million to the full year sales increase including 262 million resulting from favorable foreign currency translation excluding currency translation effects sales were 241 million or 33 above prior year levels due to the following revenues by product group sales of pharmaceutical packaging components excluding foreign currency changes were 151 million higher than the prior year due to increased sales of stoppers and seals used in a variety of customer products these increases more than compensated for a decline in sales of a prefillable syringe component caused by regulatory and insurance reimbursement changes affecting the demand for certain customer products designed to treat anemia in cancer and other patients sales of disposable medical components were 96 million lower as sales of other syringe components replaced a portion of the 136 million of 2007 sales of a lowmargin blood collection system component that we ceased producing sales of safety and administration systems and 

  

  

laboratory and other services were 186 million higher than the prior year most of which was due to increased demand for our drug reconstitution products and higher tooling activity 

tech group  full year sales were 187 million below 2007 levels including 36 million of favorable foreign currency translation excluding the impact of foreign currency translation sales were 223 million or 77 below prior year levels as follows sales of healthcare devices excluding foreign currency changes decreased 232 million compared with 2007 after considering the lost exubera sales of 330 million we experienced increased sales volume of other healthcare devices including medical filter products selfinjection pens and intranasal drug delivery systems partially offset by a dropoff in sales of packaging for a customer’s overthecounter weight loss product following a june 2007 market launch sales of consumer products tooling and other services increased by 10 million due to increased volume of juice and dairy carton closures partially offset by lower demand for certain personal care products and tooling services intersegment sales of 111 million and 105 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively were eliminated in consolidation 

the majority of intersegment sales eliminations in all periods presented represent sales of healthcare devices from the tech group to pharmaceutical systems 

information regarding fluctuations in sales by significant product group presented above has been calculated on a constant currency basis refer to note 6 segment information  to the consolidated financial statements for sales by significant product group using actual foreign currency exchange rates 

gross profit 

the following table summarizes our gross profit and related gross margins by reportable segment 

 

2009 compared to 2008 

consolidated gross profit increased by 10 million over 2008 full year results despite an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of 87 million excluding foreign exchange impacts gross profit increased by 97 million or 32 as a result of higher selling prices and a significant fourth quarter increase in volume and mix contributed by pharmaceutical systems our overall gross margin percentage remained consistent with the prior year as we were able to maintain margins through sales price increases and improved volume and mix partially offset by higher depreciation expense as described below we expect our gross margin percentage to improve within the next year as a result of improved sales volume and mix and further gains in plant efficiency from lean savings initiatives and recent restructuring efforts 

pharmaceutical systems – our reported gross profit of 2676 million increased by 19 million compared with the 2008 results excluding foreign currency translation effects of 76 million 2009 gross profit was 95 million higher than the prior year the gross margin percentage for pharmaceutical systems declined by 04 percentage points versus the prior year despite the increase in gross profit the decline was attributable to higher depreciation expense resulting from our global capital expansion activity which began in the latter half of 2008 partially offset by improved selling prices overall the price impact on our gross margin percentage was positive as increased selling prices more than offset increases in energy wages and other production costs experienced during the year 

  

  

tech group – reported gross profit of 360 million decreased by 09 million compared with the fullyear 2008 results including 11 million in unfavorable foreign currency effects excluding the translation effects 2009 gross profit was slightly higher than the prior year despite a decrease in gross profit our 2009 profit margin percentage improved slightly to 139 compared with the prior year largely due to the impact of reduced resin costs on selling prices which resulted in a higher ratio of gross profit to revenues also contributing to the gross margin improvement was a reduction in plant overhead costs and improved production efficiency resulting from our restructuring efforts in the us and higher production volume within our european operations 

2008 compared to 2007 

consolidated gross profit increased by 108 million over 2007 including the favorable effect from foreign currency translation of 94 million the gross margin percentage improved slightly despite the unfavorable impact on sales volume and mix caused by the loss of discrete business described in the net sales section above 

pharmaceutical systems  gross margin for pharmaceutical systems declined by one percentage point versus the prior year approximately half of this decrease was due to unfavorable volume and mix resulting from the regulatory and insurance reimbursement issues affecting the demand for prefillable syringe components used in certain anemia products the remaining decline resulted from increased depreciation expense and production cost increases as the positive benefit of sales price increases offset a majority of the increased costs of raw materials wages and utilities used to operate our production facilities 

tech group  gross margins improved by 14 percentage points in comparison to prior year results the improved gross margin performance was largely due to a significant reduction in plant overhead and improved production efficiency which contributed 34 percentage points these gains resulted from our restructuring efforts and efficiencies from the completion of startup activities at our expanded production facility in michigan partially offsetting these increases by 15 percentage points was the impact of lower sales and unfavorable mix despite sales increases in consumer products and other healthcare devices the loss of business associated with the exubera device and the prior year weight loss product launch resulted in a decline in sales and negative impact on gross margin during the year the majority of raw material energy and wage cost increases were passed on to customers in the form of increased selling prices 

research and development “rd” costs 

our development projects are primarily a response to the market opportunities created by the convergence of primary drug packaging and delivery systems and include initiatives in traditional injection systems components for pen system applications and autoinjection systems 

the following table summarizes rd costs by reportable segment 

 

rd costs during 2009 were 12 million higher than those incurred in 2008 mostly due to accelerated development spending on our highvalue packaging and injection systems and readytouse components also contributing to the increase was incremental rd during the second half of 2009 resulting from the acquisition of plastef 

2008 rd costs were 26 million higher than those incurred in 2007 mostly due to increased spending on three ongoing development projects in the pharmaceutical systems segment these projects included our development of prefillable syringe systems that use daikyo seiko ltd “daikyo” crystal zenith® resin an advanced injection system using autoinjector technology and a passive needle safety device 

  

  

estimated 2010 rd spending is expected to exceed 2009 levels by approximately 30 as we continue to invest in advanced injectable packaging and delivery systems and safety and reconstitution products we anticipate that a majority of our developmental medical devices will be manufactured by our newlyformed pharmaceutical delivery systems segment we believe that our commitment to develop and apply proprietary technologies that improve the quality safety and effectiveness of therapeutic and diagnostic healthcare delivery systems will result in continued longterm growth 

selling general and administrative “sga” costs 

the following table summarizes sga costs by reportable segment including corporate and unallocated costs 

 

2009 compared to 2008 

consolidated sga expenses were 184 million above those recorded in 2008 excluding the favorable effects from foreign currency translation of 38 million all of which related to the pharmaceutical systems segment 2009 sga expenses were 222 million higher than the prior year sga as a percentage of net sales increased by 16 percentage points the majority of which related to the increase in us pension and other retirement plan costs 

in pharmaceutical systems excluding the favorable impact from foreign currency translation 2009 sga expenses increased by 89 million over the prioryear amount as a result of several individual items including the following other compensation costs were 21 million above those incurred in 2008 due to increased staffing of information technology and other necessary technical manufacturing support and marketing functions and from the impact of annual salary increases increased depreciation expense and other costs associated with our 2008 and 2009 information systems implementations accounted for 19 million of the increase and costs associated with our acquisition activities and geographic expansion in china accounted for 16 million of the increase severance and related benefit costs increased by 11 million most of which resulted from our decision to consolidate laboratory functions and relocate certain business development center functions various other costs including professional services and office facilities costs contributed to the remaining increase in 2009 sga expense compared to the prior year 

sga costs in the tech group were 17 million higher than the amount incurred in 2008 increases during 2009 were largely the result of annual salary and compensation increases and costs associated with our information systems upgrades 

  

  

general corporate costs include executive and director compensation other than stockbased compensation and other corporate administrative and facilities expenses that are not allocated to the segments also included in general corporate costs are any above or belowtarget performance adjustments for our worldwide cash bonus program annual cash bonus payments are made based on the achievement of sales operating profit earnings per share and cash flow targets and certain qualitative performance milestones general corporate costs for 2009 were marginally favorable to prioryear levels as the impact of annual salary increases was more than offset by lower annual cash bonus costs and reduced amounts of outside professional fees 

stockbased compensation costs for 2009 increased by 11 million compared to the prior year due to the impact of changes in our stock price on the fair value of our stockprice indexed deferred compensation liabilities during 2009 our stock price increased 143 per share closing at 3920 per share on december 31 2009 while during 2008 our stock price decreased 282 closing at 3777 per share on december 31 2008 

us pension and other retirement benefits expense in 2009 was 107 million higher than the prior year due to increased amortization of actuarial losses and lower expected return on plan assets resulting from the loss in plan asset values during the 2008 stock market decline the costs of nonus pension and other retirement benefits programs are reflected in the operating profit of the respective segment for all periods presented 

2008 compared to 2007 

consolidated sga expenses were 68 million above those recorded in 2007 but only increased marginally as a percentage of total net sales the impact of foreign currency translation accounted for 33 million of the increase 

in pharmaceutical systems 2008 sga expenses increased by 118 million over the prior year foreign currency translation accounted for 31 million of the increase compensation costs were 44 million above those incurred in 2007 due to the impact of annual pay increases and increased staffing of information technology support functions costs associated with our new information systems implementation including depreciation expense and thirdparty consulting fees accounted for 23 million of the increase various other increases including utilities and other corporate facilities costs contributed to the remaining increase in sga expense 

sga costs in the tech group were 41 million lower than the amount incurred in 2007 a net reduction in headcount associated with our restructuring efforts accounted for half of the reduction in sga the remainder of the reduction was attributable to lower amortization expense resulting from the 2007 nektar contract intangible writeoff and a reduction in various thirdparty consulting services 

general corporate sga costs were 21 million favorable to 2007 levels the majority of the decrease is the result of lower facilities and administrativerelated costs 2008 cashbased bonus costs were slightly lower than those earned in the prior year based upon management’s achievement of targets 

stockbased compensation costs for 2008 increased by 13 million due to the impact of changes in our stock price on the fair value of our stockprice indexed deferred compensation liabilities during 2008 our stock price decreased 282 per share closing at 3777 per share on december 31 2008 while during 2007 our stock price decreased 1064 per share closing at 4059 per share on december 31 2007 

  

  

restructuring impairment and other items 

other income and expense items consisting of gains losses or impairments of segment assets foreign exchange transaction gains and losses miscellaneous royalties and sundry transactions are generally recorded within the respective segment certain restructuring impairments and other discrete gains and losses considered outside the control of segment management are not allocated to our reporting segments the following table summarizes our restructuring charges and other income and expense items for each of the three years ended december 31 

 

the reduction in other expense for pharmaceutical systems is attributable to a lesser amount of foreign exchange losses on intercompany and thirdparty transactions recognized during 2009 compared with 2008 for tech group the increase in other expense resulted primarily from the recognition of foreign exchange transaction losses in 2009 compared with gains in the 2008 year 

impairment charge contract settlement and related gain net – during the fourth quarter of 2009 we determined that a costbasis investment that arose from the 2005 divestiture of a former drug delivery business was impaired and we recorded a 08 million charge to writeoff our investment we do not expect any further charges associated with this investment in the fourth quarter of 2007 we recorded a 129 million impairment charge representing our net book value in the nektar contract intangible asset associated with the exubera device under an agreement reached with nektar in february 2008 we received full reimbursement for among other things severance related employee costs equipment purchased raw materials and components leases and other facility costs associated with the shutdown of manufacturing operations related to this device during 2008 we received payments from nektar which more than offset the related costs incurred resulting in a net gain of 42 million 

restructuring and related charges – during the fourth quarter of 2009 we recognized restructuring and other charges of 76 million comprised of employee severance and benefits costs of 27 million asset impairment and accelerated depreciation of 48 million and 01 million in asset relocation costs during 2009 we also incurred 11 million in restructuring costs consisting mostly of employee severance benefits asset impairments and accelerated depreciation associated with the completion of our 2007 tech group restructuring program 

during 2008 and 2007 we incurred 30 million and 34 million respectively as part of the 2007 tech group restructuring plan the majority of these charges in each year related to severance and postemployment benefits and a smaller portion resulted from asset impairments and accelerated depreciation and other related costs 

brazil tax penalties and amnesty benefits – in september 2009 we enrolled in a tax amnesty program which provided for reduced penalties and interest on certain taxrelated obligations during 2007 we increased our accruals for a series of social excise and other tax contingencies in brazil by 101 million these charges followed a detailed review of several related tax cases pending in the brazilian courts which indicated that it was probable that our positions taken on previous tax returns some of which date back to the late 1990’s would not be sustained 

  

  

refer to note 4 restructuring and other items to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the restructuring impairment and other items within this section 

operating profit 

operating profit loss by reportable segment corporate and other unallocated costs was as follows 

 

2009 compared to 2008 

our 2009 combined segment operating profit decreased by 63 million from that achieved in the prior year including an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 51 million the pharmaceutical systems segment’s 2009 results were lower by 25 million as a result of higher general and administrative and rd costs and unfavorable foreign currency changes offset partially by increased gross profit excluding a 39 million unfavorable foreign exchange impact pharmaceutical systems’ operating profit exceeded the 2008 amount by 14 million tech group operating profit was 38 million below that achieved in the prior year largely due to increased general and administrative costs and a decline in gross profit on lower sales 

consolidated operating profit for 2009 and 2008 was reduced by corporate and unallocated costs of 507 million and 304 million respectively the majority of these increased costs related to the us pension and other retirement benefits expense as described in the selling general and administrative costs section above and restructuring impairment and other unallocated charges 

2008 compared to 2007 

the 2008 combined segment operating profit increased by 10 million from that achieved in the 2007 year including a favorable foreign exchange impact of 58 million pharmaceutical systems operating profit was lower than prior year results by 52 million including a foreign currency translation benefit of 55 million the impact of higher sales and gross profit was more than offset by higher spending on information systems and research and development initiatives as we replaced outdated management reporting systems and invested in innovative products for the future tech group operating profit was 62 million above that achieved in the prior year including a foreign currency benefit of 03 million largely due to savings resulting from the restructuring program initiated in late 2007 and production efficiencies coming from higher throughput at our recently expanded michigan facility 

consolidated operating profit for 2008 and 2007 also included corporate and unallocated costs of 304 million and 586 million respectively the majority of this decrease related to other unallocated items which are described in the restructuring impairment and other items section above 

interest expense net 

the following table summarizes our net interest expense 

 

  

  

2009 compared to 2008 

consolidated interest expense net for 2009 was relatively consistent with the prior year as lower interest rates reduced both interest expense on our variable rate revolving credit facility and interest income on bank deposits in addition we held less cash on average during 2009 as compared with the prior year the majority of capitalized interest during both 2009 and 2008 resulted from our plant expansion projects in europe and the construction of our new plastics plant in china 

2008 compared to 2007 

consolidated interest expense net during 2008 increased 61 million compared with the prior year interest expense for the 2008 year was 22 million above that recorded in 2007 the timing of our issuance of 1615 million in convertible debt in march and april of 2007 accounted for 13 million of the fullyear increase as the notes were outstanding for the entire 2008 year compared to a partial year in 2007 the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and bank commitment fees accounted for another 10 million of the increase the decrease in interest income is also largely due to the timing of the convertible debt issuance as a portion of the proceeds was invested in money market accounts and a strategic cash management fund in the first half of 2007 and then subsequently used in our stock buyback program and in our capital expansion programs in addition interest income was reduced by otherthantemporary losses on our strategic cash management fund investment totaling 14 million in 2008 capitalized interest increased as a result of our pharmaceutical systems capital expansion projects in europe 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate was 162 in 2009 216 in 2008 and 199 in 2007 the following discrete items affected the comparability of effective tax rates in 2009 versus 2008 

 

 

 

 

 

during 2009 we recognized a pretax benefit of 20 million relating to our participation in the tax amnesty program in brazil along with the related income tax provision of 16 million the impact of these items and the tax effect on restructuring impairment and other charges reduced our effective tax rate by 72 percentage points in 2009 and 32 percentage points in 2008 excluding these items mentioned above our effective tax rate was 234 and 248 for 2009 and 2008 respectively the lower 2009 effective tax rate resulted from a larger amount of us foreign tax credits on taxes paid in certain foreign jurisdictions and increased current year development activities that qualified for rd tax credits 

in addition to the 2008 factors listed above the following items impacted the comparability of the tax rate in 2008 versus 2007 

 

 

  

  

the impact of these two items and the 2007 restructuring activities reduced our effective tax rate by 88 percentage points excluding these items in both years’ results in an effective tax rate of 248 in 2008 and 287 in 2007 the decrease resulting from a change in geographic mix of earnings and an increase in rd tax benefits in the us and ireland 

our anticipated effective tax rate for the year ending december 31 2010 is expected to be relatively consistent with that of 2009 absent the impact of discrete items or legislative changes in tax rates 

equity in net income of affiliates 

equity in net income from our 25 ownership interest in daikyo in japan and our 49 ownership interest in three companies in mexico was 30 million 08 million and 25 million for the years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the significant increase in equity earnings for 2009 versus 2008 came from daikyo as their sales were 14 above prioryear levels and their gross margins improved by 8 percentage points contributing to the improvement were higher sales of various pharmaceutical packaging components an increase in royalty income and favorable foreign currency exchange rates also 2008 results were adversely affected by significant charges for plant demolition and higher pension costs as described below 

our 2008 equity income was 17 million lower than the prior year due to reduced earnings of daikyo the lower earnings were primarily the result of plant demolition and disposal costs as well as incremental depreciation expense associated with a significant crystal zenith capital expansion project and pension plan termination costs 

purchases from affiliates totaled 454 million in 2009 363 million in 2008 and 313 million in 2007 the majority of which related to a distributorship agreement with daikyo which allows us to purchase and resell daikyo products sales to affiliates were 19 million 17 million and 09 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

income from continuing operations 

income from continuing operations in 2009 was 726 million a decrease of 134 million over 2008 diluted earnings per share in 2009 was 212 a decrease of 038 per diluted share compared with the prior year our 2009 results included the impact of restructuring charges and asset impairments of 95 million pretax 63 million after tax a gain on brazilian tax amnesty benefits of 20 million pretax 04 million after tax and the recognition of discrete tax benefits totaling 61 million collectively these items increased net income from continuing operations by 02 million or 001 per diluted share 

income from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders in 2008 was 860 million an increase of 148 million over 2007 diluted earnings per share in 2008 was 250 an increase of 044 per diluted share over the prior year our 2008 results included a net gain on contract settlement proceeds of 42 million pretax 27 million after tax restructuring and related charges of 30 million pretax 19 million after tax and discrete income tax benefits of 35 million in the aggregate these items increased net income from continuing operations by 43 million or 012 per diluted share 

income from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders in 2007 was 712 million or 206 per diluted share our 2007 results include the impact of restructuring charges an impairment loss on our customer contract intangible asset with nektar and our provisions for brazilian tax issues which totaled 264 million pretax 194 million after tax and discrete tax benefits of 82 million collectively these items reduced net income from continuing operations by 112 million or 031 per diluted share 

discontinued operations 

our 2007 results included a 05 million provision for claims resulting from the 2005 divestiture of our former drug delivery business 

  

  

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow activity 

the following table and explanations provide cash flow data from continuing operations for the years ended december 31 

 

cash flows from operating activities – our 2009 operating cash flows increased 27 million compared to the prior year the lower net income in the current year net of an increased amount of noncash charges such as depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation was more than offset by favorable variances in other assets and liabilities including lower cash paid for taxes in 2009 compared with the prior year included in 2009 net cash provided by operating activities was a 100 million voluntary contribution to our us qualified pension plan compared with no contributions made during 2008 included in 2008 operating cash flow was a 127 million payment for income tax and other taxrelated issues in brazil 

operating cash flow increased 58 million in 2008 compared to the prior year including 167 million in proceeds received from our contract settlement with nektar partially offset by related cash costs of 70 million our favorable cash flow from operating results and the impact of this contract settlement was reduced by the 2008 payment of income and other taxrelated liabilities in brazil totaling 127 million operating cash flows in 2007 also reflected significant cash payments related to tax issues in brazil during 2007 we paid 117 million to escrow representing judicial deposits for the benefit of the brazil government to avoid further accretion of interest and penalties on taxrelated liabilities after considering these items the 2008 cash flows from operating activities were slightly lower than 2007 as increased earnings in 2008 were offset by cash outflows for changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities 

cash flows from investing activities – cash used in investing activities was 22 million higher than the 2008 amount as a result of increased spending on a business acquisition and fewer cash redemptions of shortterm investments partially offset by decreased capital spending during 2009 cash redemptions from shortterm investments were 142 million less than the prior year the majority of which related to the liquidation of our investment in the columbia strategic cash portfolio fund which was fully redeemed at december 31 2009 see note 15 fair value of financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the columbia strategic cash portfolio fund cash paid to acquire the plastef business assets and other acquisitionrelated earnouts paid during 2009 totaled 198 million 

capital spending in 2009 totaled 1049 million a 337 million decrease over the prior year pharmaceutical systems spending was 933 million a decrease of 290 million over the prior year resulting from the completion of several major plant expansion projects that began during 2008 and were placed into service during 2009 in the aggregate we spent 263 million less for capital expansion projects in 2009 compared to the prior year a portion of which was the result of discretionary reductions in spending as we postponed certain components of our expansion plans in response to the recessionary impacts on market demand the remainder of the decrease related to lower spending on information technology projects as our project to replace our north american procurement and plant operations systems was completed in the fourth quarter of 2009 tech group capital spending was 114 million an increase of 22 million compared to the prior year the remainder of the decrease relates to changes in the 2009 balance of accrued capital spending compared to the 2008 change 

in 2008 cash flows used in investing activities were 362 million less than the prior year despite a 92 million increase in capital spending the majority of the yearoveryear decrease resulted from 168 million in redemptions from the columbia strategic cash portfolio fund compared to 227 million in net purchases in 2007 

  

  

capital spending totaled 1386 million in 2008 compared with 1294 million in the prior year pharmaceutical systems spending was 1223 million an increase of 142 million over the prior year the increase was the result of major projects to increase our manufacturing capacity including the expansion of our rubber compounding capacity in kinston north carolina and ongoing plant expansion projects in europe and asia a portion of the total spending increase pertained to information technology as we replaced our financial reporting cash disbursements and ordertocash systems in north america tech group capital spending was 92 million a decrease of 117 million compared to the prior year spending in 2007 was higher due to our grand rapids michigan plant expansion project the remainder of the increase relates to a change in the 2008 balance of accrued capital spending compared to the 2007 change 

cash flows from financing activities – the yearoveryear decrease in cash used for financing activities was the result of payments made in 2008 to acquire the remaining noncontrolling interest 10 in our medimop subsidiaries partially offset by a larger amount of debt repayment and higher dividend payments in 2009 compared to 2008 cash flows used in financing activities for 2009 included 59 million in net repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and 43 million in payments of shortterm notes and capital leases compared with combined net debt repayments of 92 million in 2008 we paid cash dividends totaling 201 million 061 per share during 2009 compared to 186 million 057 per share and 175 million 053 per share in 2008 and 2007 respectively we expect to continue our quarterly dividend program subject to annual board of directors’ approval 

in 2008 the majority of the yearoveryear decrease in cash flows from financing activities resulted from the 2007 issuance of longterm debt partially offset by stock repurchase activity and the acquisition of the remaining noncontrolling ownership of medimop for 85 million cash flows used in financing activities for 2008 included 123 million in net repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and 31 million in new issuances of shortterm notes payable cash dividends paid during 2008 increase by 11 million over the 2007 amount cash flows provided by financing activities for 2007 included the issuance of 1615 million of convertible junior subordinated debentures carrying a 4 coupon rate and due in march of 2047 resulting in net cash proceeds of 1563 million after payment of underwriting and other costs of 52 million these net proceeds provided funds used in the reduction of revolving credit facility borrowings totaling 191 million during 2007 we initiated and completed an openmarket repurchase program under which we acquired 980300 shares of common stock at total cost of 394 million 4023 per share 

liquidity measures 

the table below displays key liquidity measures for west as of december 31 

 

shortterm investments that have maturities of ninety days or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities current ratio is defined as the ratio of current assets to current liabilities net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents and total invested capital is defined as the sum of net debt and total shareholders equity 

working capital at december 31 2009 increased 190 million compared with the balance at december 31 2008 reflecting higher trade accounts receivable and inventories partially offset by increased accrued liabilities balances both accounts receivable and inventory increased due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and from the addition of assets acquired from plastef in july 2009 in addition accounts receivable was higher as a result of a significant increase in fourth quarter 2009 sales and inventory increased 

  

  

due to an increase in strategic stock of certain raw materials and higher finished goods balances our accounts receivable dayssalesoutstanding “dso” ratio was 48 days at december 31 2009 compared to 45 days at december 31 2008 and our inventory turnover ratio was 61 and 65 at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively included in working capital at december 31 2009 and 2008 was cash held in escrow representing judicial deposits for the government of brazil related to various tax positions taken in prior years and the related tax liabilities the escrow balance recorded in other current assets at december 31 2009 was 121 million which will be used to settle our outstanding taxrelated obligations in that country as a result of the 2009 brazil tax amnesty program we estimate that 48 million in excess deposits will be returned to us over the next twelve months as the underlying tax cases are settled 

the 2009 ratio of net debttototal invested capital decreased by 41 percentage points compared with the prior year as a result of our debt repayments and increases in other comprehensive income resulting from foreign currency translation and current year earnings net of dividends the 64 million decrease in total debt resulted from 102 million in cash payments partially offset by foreign exchange increases of 14 million and 24 million in capital leases acquired from plastef 

based on our business outlook and our capital structure at the close of 2009 we believe that we have ample liquidity to fund our business needs new product development capital expansion pension and other postretirement benefits and to pay dividends we expect that our cash requirements for the foreseeable future will be met primarily through our cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents on hand and amounts available under our 2000 million multicurrency unsecured committed revolving credit agreement which we generally use for working capital requirements as of december 31 2009 we had available 1745 million of borrowing capacity under this facility and we have not experienced any limit on our ability to access this source of funds amounts outstanding under this revolving credit agreement are currently classified as longterm debt based upon our intent and ability to refinance amounts borrowed on a longterm basis due to the fact that this facility expires in february of 2011 any amounts outstanding under this facility as of the end of our first quarter in 2010 will need to be reclassified to current liabilities we currently intend to enter into a replacement facility prior to the february 2011 expiry date market conditions could affect the cost and terms of the replacement facility as well as terms of other debt instruments we enter into from time to time 

to date we have not experienced any significant increase in customer collectibility risks nor have we experienced increased supply risks due to vendor insolvency we do not expect that recent global credit market conditions will have a significant impact on our liquidity however no assurance can be given that the ongoing economic downturn will not have a material adverse effect on our demand for products liquidity or capital resources 

commitments and contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments at december 31 2009 these obligations are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity 

 

 

  

  

reserves for uncertain tax positions  the table above does not include 56 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately 05 million of associated accrued interest as of december 31 2009 due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for amounts which may be paid 

letters of credit  we have letters of credit totaling 21 million supporting the reimbursement of workers’ compensation and other claims paid on our behalf by insurance carriers and to guarantee equipment lease payments in ireland and the payment of sales tax liabilities in the us the accrual for insurance obligations was 52 million at december 31 2009 

unconditional purchase obligations – our business creates a need to enter into various commitments with suppliers in accordance with us gaap these purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets these purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements and are in the normal course of business 

foreign currency contracts – we periodically enter into foreign currency contracts to reduce our exposure to variability in cash flows related to anticipated purchases of raw materials and other inventory denominated in nonfunctional currencies we also enter into forward exchange contracts to mitigate exposure of nonfunctional currency asset and liability balances to changes in exchange rates as of december 31 2009 the liability at a fair value of our foreign currency hedge contract was 01 million which was not reflected in the above table 

pensionother postretirement obligations – our objective in funding the us taxqualified pension plan is to accumulate funds sufficient to provide for all benefits and to satisfy the minimum contribution requirements of erisa our annual funding decision also takes into account the extent to which the benefit obligation exceeds its corresponding funded status outside of the us our objective is to fund the retirement costs over time within the limits of minimum requirements and allowable tax deductions the table above reflects an estimated 2010 minimum us qualified pension plan contribution in the amount of 80 million the amounts and timing of future company contributions to the defined benefit and other postretirement pension plans are unknown because they are dependent on pension fund asset performance as well as other factors the nonqualified defined benefit pension plans and postretirement medical plans are generally not funded in advance 

offbalance sheet agreements 

at december 31 2009 the company had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business and outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs and leased equipment and sales tax liability guarantees as noted above 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions some of which are subjective and complex that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our results of operations and financial position 

  

  

revenue recognition   the majority of our revenue is generated from our product manufacturing operations which convert rubber metal and plastic raw materials into parts used in closure systems and syringe components for use with injectable drugs and drug delivery devices sales of manufactured components are recorded at the time title and risk of loss passes to the customer some customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes management records rebate costs when the sales occur based on its assessment of the likelihood that these volumes will be attained we also establish product return liabilities for customer quality claims when such amounts are deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated 

impairment of longlived assets we review goodwill and other longlived assets annually and whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment as part of the reporting unit to which it belongs our reporting units are the same as our operating segments which we have determined to be the americas and europeasia pacific divisions of the pharmaceutical systems segment and the americas and europe divisions of our tech group segment for assets held and used in the business management estimates the future cash flows to be derived from the related asset or business unit when assets are held for sale management determines fair value by estimating the anticipated proceeds to be received upon the sale of the asset less disposition costs changes in the estimate of fair value including the estimate of future cash flows could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position 

employee benefits we sponsor qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans that cover employees in the us and in a number of other countries in addition we sponsor unfunded postretirement benefit plans which provide healthcare benefits for eligible employees who retire or are disabled the measurement of the annual cost and obligations under our defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plans is subject to a number of assumptions us gaap accounting for compensation and retirement benefits requires companies to use an expected longterm rate of asset return assumption for computing current year pension expense for us plans which accounted for 91 of global plan assets the longterm rate of return assumption was 775 in 2009 and 80 in the prior two years this assumption is reviewed annually and determined by the projected return for our target mix of plan assets approximately 65 equity and 35 debt securities differences between the actual and expected returns are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently amortized into earnings as actuarial gains or losses the accounting standards also require companies to discount future obligations back to today’s dollars using an appropriate discount rate the discount rate selected is the single rate equivalent for a theoretical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that produces a cash flow pattern equivalent to our plans’ projected benefit payments an increase in the discount rate decreases the pension benefit obligation this decrease is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently amortized into earnings as an actuarial gain 

changes in key assumptions including the market performance of plan assets and other actuarial assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position we estimate that every 25 basis point reduction in the longterm rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by 05 million and a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase pension expense by 05 million 

the discount rate used in determining the us pension plans’ benefit obligation at december 31 2009 decreased 50 basis points to 60 to reflect market conditions at that time as of december 31 2009 pretax actuarial losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to pension and other retirement benefits were 884 million including a current year actuarial gain of 11 million compared with a 2008 actuarial loss of 565 million we estimate that our 2010 pension costs will be approximately 20 lower than 2009 as a result of improved plan asset performance and other changes in assumptions 

  

  

us gaap requires the recognition of an asset or liability for the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as measured by the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation for a pension plan the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation for any other postretirement plan such as a retiree health plan the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for 2009 the us pension plan assets generated an actual return of 265 compared to a loss of 250 in 2008 resulting in an improvement in funded status during 2009 compared to the significant decline in funded status during the prior year partially offsetting the improvement was a decrease in our weighted average discount rate from 646 at december 31 2008 to 594 at december 31 2009 which increased our pension plan liability our net pension underfunded balance at december 31 2009 was 691 million compared to 730 million at december 31 2008 our underfunded balance for other postretirement benefits was 181 million and 150 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively 

income taxes   we estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation in addition deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established to recognize differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities we maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized the recoverability of tax assets is subject to our estimates of future profitability generally at the respective subsidiary company and country level changes in tax legislation business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined 

on january 1 2007 we adopted the requirements for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements which prescribes a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the adoption of this accounting standard resulted in the recognition of net tax assets that met the morelikelythannot threshold of 216 million and was reflected as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for 2007 

please refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies and note 19 new accounting standards  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on accounting and reporting standards considered in the preparation and presentation of our financial statements 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risk factors such as fluctuating interest rates foreign currency exchange rates and increasing commodity prices these risk factors can impact our results of operations cash flows and financial position to manage these risks we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps call options and forward exchange contracts for periods consistent with and for notional amounts equal to or less than the underlying exposures in accordance with company policy derivative financial instruments are not used for speculation or trading purposes 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have subsidiaries outside the us accounting for over 50 of consolidated net sales virtually all of these sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into us dollars for consolidated reporting purposes although the majority of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary they may also hold assets or liabilities not denominated in other currencies these items may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains and losses as a result our results of operations and financial position are exposed to changing currency exchange rates we periodically use forward contracts to hedge certain transactions or to neutralize monthend balance sheet exposures on crosscurrency intercompany loans 

as of december 31 2009 we have entered into a forward exchange contract hedging a nonfunctional currency obligation with a fair value of 01 million at december 31 2009 

  

  

in addition we have designated our €815 million eurodenominated notes as a hedge of our investment in the net assets of our european operations we also have a 17 billion yendenominated note payable which has been designated as a hedge of our investment in a japanese affiliate at december 31 2009 a cumulative foreign currency translation loss on these net investment hedges of 144 million net of tax of 89 million was recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income 

interest rate risk 

as a result of our normal borrowing activities we have longterm debt with both fixed and variable interest rates longterm debt consists of senior notes convertible debentures revolving credit facilities and capital lease obligations our exposures to fluctuations in interest rates are managed to the extent considered necessary by entering into interest rate swap agreements 

the following table summarizes our interest rate risksensitive instruments 

 

1 as of december 31 2009 we have two interest rate swap agreements outstanding which are designed to protect against volatility in variable interest rates payable on a 500 million note maturing on july 28 2012 “series a note” and a 250 million note maturing july 28 2015 “series b note” the first interestrate swap agreement has a notional amount of 500 million and corresponds to the maturity date of the series a note and the second interest rate swap has a notional amount of 250 million and corresponds with the maturity date of the series b note under each of the swap agreements we will receive variable interest rate payments based on threemonth libor in return for making quarterly fixed payments the interestrate swap agreements effectively fix the interest rates payable on our series a and b notes at 532 and 551 respectively at december 31 2009 the interest rateswap agreements had a fair value of 55 million unfavorable to the company and are recorded as a noncurrent liability 

commodity price risk 

many of our pharmaceutical systems products are made from synthetic elastomers which are derived from the petroleum refining process we purchase the majority of our elastomers via longterm supply contracts some of which contain clauses that provide for surcharges related to changes in crude oil prices in december 2009 we purchased a series of crude oil call options for a total of 47000 barrels of crude oil which are intended to reduce our exposure to increases in oilbased surcharges and protect operating cash flows with regard to a portion of our forecasted elastomer purchases during the months of july through december 2010 these call options cap our cost of the crude oil component of elastomer prices for a portion of our forecasted purchases allowing us to limit our exposure to increasing petroleum prices with these option contracts we may benefit from a decline in crude oil prices as there is no downward exposure other than the premium that we paid to purchase the contracts these call options were not designated as hedging instruments

 item 9a  controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that as of december 31 2009 our disclosure controls and procedures are effective 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 based on the framework established in “internal controlintegrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2009 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2009 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered pubic accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein 

changes in internal controls 

during the second quarter of 2008 we successfully replaced our financial reporting cash disbursement and ordertocash systems in our north american operations with a new enterprise resource planning “erp” system phase two of the project which focused on procurement and plant operations as well as updates to shop floor systems commenced in late 2008 and was completed in the fourth quarter of 2009 these implementations have resulted in certain changes to business processes and internal controls impacting financial reporting we have evaluated the control environment as affected by this project and believe that our controls remained effective 

during the period covered by this report there have been no other changes to our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

business segments 

we have two reportable segments pharmaceutical systems and tech group comparative segment revenues and related financial information for 2008 2007 and 2006 are presented in a table contained in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements segment information  and are discussed within results of operations in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of this 2008 form 10k intersegment sales are eliminated in consolidation 

pharmaceutical systems segment 

our pharmaceutical systems segment designs manufactures and sells a variety of packaging components and systems used in parenteral drug delivery for the pharmaceutical biopharmaceutical and generic industries the primary components we manufacture are subject to regulatory oversight within our customers’ manufacturing facilities we have manufacturing facilities in north and south america europe and asia pacific with affiliated companies in mexico and japan see item 2 properties    for additional information on our manufacturing sites 

our pharmaceutical systems segment consists of two operating segments — americas and europeasia pacific — which are aggregated for reporting purposes because they have similar economic characteristics as well as similar products manufacturing processes customer objectives distribution procedures and regulatory requirements 

our pharmaceutical systems business is composed of the following product lines 

pharmaceutical packaging 

 

 

 

 

 

disposable medical components 

 

 

 

 

 

safety and administration 

 

laboratory and other services 

 

products and services recently brought to market are the daikyo crystal zenith® luer lock syringe envision™ and the west ready pack™ system the daikyo crystal zenith syringe is the market’s first siliconefree readytouse prefillable syringe that offers pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies a total system solution that can mitigate the risks associated with glass syringes west’s envision components plungers and stoppers are inspected by an automated vision inspection system to ensure they meet enhanced quality specifications for visible and subvisible particulate and contamination the west ready pack system is a onesource solution ideal for pharmaceutical research and development and clinical work each system comes with west stoppers flipoff seals and vials conveniently packaged in small volumes because the components are delivered readytouse component preparation is eliminated from the customer’s processing saving them time and money 

our tamperevident flipoff seals consist of a metal overseal and a molded plastic cap that is removed in order to permit needle access to the drugvial contents these are sold in a wide range of sizes and colors to meet customers’ needs for product identification and differentiation the seals can be provided using proprietary printing and embossing technology for multiple layers of protection such as pointofuse instructions itemlevel information such as vial contents drug dosage and strength and cautionary statements that can serve as counterfeiting deterrence 

elastomeric components are offered in a variety of standard and customerspecific configurations and formulations and are available with advanced barrier films and coatings to enhance their performance our proprietary flurotec® coating is a film that is applied using a patented molding process to reduce the risk of product loss by contamination enhance seal integrity and protect the shelf life of packaged drugs we also apply a teflon® coating to the surface of stoppers and plungers to improve compatibility between the closure and the drug b2coating is a coating applied to the surface of stoppers and plungers using a patented process that eliminates the need for conventional silicone application it helps manufacturers reduce product rejections due to trace levels of silicone molecules found in noncoated packaged drug compounds flurotec and b2coating technologies are licensed from daikyo seiko ltd 

our verisure components are an example of how laboratory services can be combined with a product offering these components allow pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies to navigate the complex task of extractables identification and the related analysis for qualifying a drug product’s containerclosure system more efficiently the customer will receive a certificate of analysis with each shipment of components also with a known extractables profile customers can begin the design of leachables studies on a quicker basis a process which our analytical laboratory services can support 

in addition our postmanufacturing processes westar rs and westar ru are documented and fully validated procedures for washing and siliconizing stoppers and syringe components to remove biological materials and endotoxins westar rs prepares components for introduction into the customer’s sterilizer and westar ru provides sterilized components the westar processes increase the overall efficiency of injectable drug production by outsourcing component processing thereby eliminating steps otherwise required in each of our customers’ manufacturing processes and assure compliance with the latest regulatory requirements for component preparation 

medimop medical projects ltd is a leader in the world market for transfer mixing and administration systems for injectable pharmaceuticals many injectable drug products are produced as freezedried powders in order to preserve product efficacy during shipment and storage these products must be reconstituted typically by diluting the powder with sterile water or other diluent at the point of use all medimop products marketed in the united states us are cleared by the us food and drug administration fda in addition many medimop products are protected by patents 

as an adjunct to our pharmaceutical systems products we offer contract analytical laboratory services for testing and evaluating primary drug packaging components and their compatibility with the contained drug formulation west analytical services provides us and our customers with indepth knowledge and analysis of the interaction and compatibility of drug products with elastomer glass and plastic packaging components our analytical laboratories also provide specialized testing for complete drug delivery systems 

tech group segment 

our tech group segment is a global custom injection molder with over 40 years of experience offering contract manufacturing solutions for the healthcare and consumer industries this segment has manufacturing operations in the us puerto rico and ireland see item 2 properties  for additional information on our manufacturing sites 

our tech group segment consists of two operating segments — americas and europe — which are aggregated for reporting purposes because they have similar economic characteristics as well as similar products manufacturing processes customer objectives distribution procedures and regulatory requirements the tech group is committed to producing the highest quality injection molded components and devices which include unique components for surgical ophthalmic diagnostic and drug delivery systems such as contact lens storage kits pill dispensers and disposable blood collection systems as well as various personal care and consumer products the tech group’s record of success includes manufacturing and assembly of systems and devices used for nasal oral pulmonary and injectable delivery of drugs used to treat diseases affecting the lives of people around the world 

the tech group segment also has expertise in product design and development including inhouse mold design and construction an engineering center for developmental and prototype tooling process design and validation and highspeed automated assemblies technologies include multicomponent molding inmold labeling ultrasonic welding and clean room molding and device assembly 

our newest offering will be the confidose® autoinjector system a solution for enhancing patient compliance and safety the needle remains shielded at all times and retracts automatically after the injection the system eliminates preparation steps and automates the injection of drugs providing patients with a sterile singleuse disposable system that can be readily used at home the tech group segment will be responsible for manufacturing and assembling commercial quantities of this system 

in an effort to align our plant capacity and workforce with the revised business outlook in december 2007 our board of directors approved a restructuring plan for the tech group segment designed to reduce operating costs and increase the manufacturing efficiency of the segment we incurred a total of 64 million in restructuring and related charges as part of this plan through december 31 2008 we expect to incur additional amounts of no more than 10 million during the first half of 2009 as these restructuring activities are concluded for additional details see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements restructuring and other items  

international 

we have significant operations outside the us they are managed through the same business segments as our us operations – pharmaceutical systems and tech group sales outside of the us account for approximately 54 of consolidated net sales for a geographic breakdown of sales see the table in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements segment information  

although the general business processes are similar to the domestic business international operations are exposed to additional risks these risks include currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar multiple tax jurisdictions and particularly in latin and south america and israel political and social issues that could destabilize local markets and affect the demand for our products 

depending on the direction of change relative to the us dollar foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations see the discussion under the caption summary of significant accounting policies  foreign currency translation in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements also see note 3 restructuring and other items  we attempt to minimize some of our exposure to these exchange rate fluctuations through the use of forward exchange contracts and foreign currency denominated debt this activity is generally discussed in note 1 under the caption summary of significant accounting policies – financial instruments and in note 15 financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements in this 2008 form 10k 

raw materials 

 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers aluminum and plastic elastomers include both natural and synthetic materials we have access to adequate supplies of these raw materials to meet our production needs through agreements with suppliers 

 

we employ a supplychain management strategy in our reporting segments which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply this strategy has reduced the number of our raw material suppliers due to regulatory control over our production processes and the cost and time involved in qualifying suppliers we rely on singlesource suppliers for many critical raw materials this strategy increases the risk that our supply lines may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production problem these risks are managed where possible by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites rigid quality control systems surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in case of an interruption in production and therefore we foresee no significant availability problems in the near future 

intellectual property rights 

 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business we own or license numerous patents and have patent applications pending in the us and in other countries that relate to various aspects of our products in addition key valueadded and proprietary products and processes are licensed from our japanese affiliate daikyo seiko ltd our patents and other proprietary rights have been useful in establishing our market share and in the growth of our business and are expected to continue to be of value in the future as we continue to develop proprietary products although important in the aggregate we do not consider our business to be materially dependent on any individual patent 

 

we also rely heavily on trade secrets manufacturing knowhow and continuing technological innovations as well as inlicensing opportunities to maintain and further develop our competitive position particularly in the area of formulation development and tooling design 

seasonality 

 

although our pharmaceutical systems business is not inherently seasonal sales and operating profit in the second half of the year are typically lower than the first half primarily due to scheduled plant shutdowns in conjunction with our customers’ production schedules and the yearend impact of holidays on production during the shutdown periods maintenance procedures are performed and vacations are taken by production employees 

 

working capital 

 

we are required to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet customer requirements other agreements also require us to purchase inventory in bulk orders which increases inventory levels but decreases the risk of supply interruption levels of inventory are also influenced by the seasonal patterns addressed above for a more detailed discussion of working capital please see the discussion in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resource s 

 

marketing 

 

our pharmaceutical systems customers include practically every major branded pharmaceutical generic and biopharmaceutical company in the world pharmaceutical systems components and other products are sold to major pharmaceutical biotechnology and hospital supplymedical device companies which incorporate them into their products for distribution to the ultimate enduser 

 

with extensive experience in contract manufacturing our tech group segment sells to many of the world’s largest medical device and pharmaceutical companies and to large customers in the personal care and foodandbeverage industries tech group components generally are incorporated into our customers’ manufacturing lines for further processing or assembly west’s products and services are distributed primarily through our own sales force and distribution network with limited use of contract sales agents and regional distributors 

 

our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 358 of our consolidated net sales in 2008 but not one of these customers individually accounted for more than 10 of net sales 

order backlog 

 

at december 31 2008 our order backlog was 2301 million most of which is expected to be filled during fiscal year 2009 the order backlog was 2530 million at the end of 2007 the decrease is primarily due to foreign currency translation in addition our success in reducing lead times and improving ontime delivery performance has resulted in customer orders closer to the delivery date which decreases backlog order backlog includes firm orders placed by customers for manufacture over a period of time according to their schedule or upon confirmation by the customer we also have contractual arrangements with a number of our customers and products covered by these contracts are included in our backlog only as orders are received 

 

competition 

 

we compete with several companies across our pharmaceutical systems product lines however we believe that we supply a major portion of the us market for pharmaceutical elastomer and metal packaging components and have a significant share of the european market for these components because of the special nature of our pharmaceutical packaging components and our longstanding participation in the market competition is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive costcontrol programs across their entire operations 

 

we differentiate ourselves from our competition as a fullservice valueadded global supplier that can provide presale formula and engineering development analytical services regulatory expertise and postmanufacturing technologies as well as aftersale technical support customers also appreciate the global scope of west’s manufacturing capability and our ability to produce many products at multiple sites 

 

our tech group business is in very competitive markets for both healthcare and consumer products the competition varies from smaller regional companies to large global molders that command significant market shares there are extreme cost pressures and many of our customers look offshore to reduce cost we differentiate ourselves by leveraging our global capability and by employing new technologies such as highspeed automated assembly insertmolding multishot molding and expertise with multiplepiece closure systems because of the more demanding regulatory requirements in the medical device component area there are a smaller number of other competitors mostly largescale companies we compete for this market on the basis of our reputation for quality and reliability in engineering and project management diverse contract manufacturing capabilities and knowledge of and experience in complying with fda requirements 

 

research and development activities 

we maintain our own researchscale production facilities and laboratories for developing new products and offer contract engineering design and development services to assist customers with new product development 

 

our quality control regulatory and laboratory testing capabilities are used to ensure compliance with applicable manufacturing and regulatory standards for primary and secondary pharmaceutical packaging components the engineering departments are responsible for product and tooling design and testing and for the design and construction of processing equipment the primary responsibility of our innovation group is seeking new opportunities in injectable packaging and delivery systems most of which will be manufactured by our tech group segment and marketed by our pharmaceutical systems segment research and development spending will continue to increase as we pursue innovative strategic platforms in prefillable syringe injectable container advanced injection and safety and administration systems 

 

we spent 172 million in 2008 140 million in 2007 and 87 million in 2006 on development and engineering for the pharmaceutical systems segment the tech group segment incurred research and development expenses of 15 million 21 million and 24 million in the years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

commercial development of our new products and services for medical and pharmaceutical applications commonly requires several years new products that we develop may require separate approval as medical devices and products that are intended to be used in packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical products will be subject to both customer acceptance of our products and regulatory approval of the customer’s products following our development period 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2008 we employed 6300 people in our operations throughout the world 

 




 item 1a risk factors and cautionary factors that may affect future results 

 

the statements in this section describe major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

our disclosure and analysis in this 2008 form 10k contains some forwardlooking statements that are based on management’s beliefs and assumptions we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forwardlooking statements such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts we have attempted wherever possible to identify forwardlooking statements by using words such as “estimate” “expect” “intend” “believe” “plan” “anticipate” and other words and terms of similar meaning in particular these include statements relating to future actions business plans and prospects new products future performance or results of current or anticipated products sales efforts expenses interest rates foreignexchange rates economic effects the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results 

many of the factors that will determine our future results are beyond our ability to control or predict achievement of future results is subject to known or unknown risks or uncertainties and therefore actual results could differ materially from past results and those expressed or implied in any forwardlooking statement you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements 

we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise we also refer you to further disclosures we make on related subjects in our quarterly reports on form 10q and 8k reports to the securities and exchange commission 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 

as widely reported financial markets in the us europe and asia have been experiencing extreme disruption in recent months including volatility in security prices severely diminished liquidity and credit availability rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others our operating results in one or more geographic regions may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in the us europe or asia remain uncertain or weaken further we may experience material adverse impacts on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to credit risk on accounts receivable and certain prepayments made in the normal course of business this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 

a substantial majority of our outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance in addition we have made prepayments associated with insurance premiums and other advances in the normal course of business while we have procedures to periodically monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on trade receivables and other current assets there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk and avoid losses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values and the risk of loss of our investment portfolio 

our available cash and cash equivalents are held in bank deposits money market funds and other shortterm investments we have funds in our operating accounts that are with thirdparty financial institutions these balances in the us may exceed the fdic federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits while we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the balances as appropriate we could lose this cash or be unable to withdraw it in a timely manner if the underlying financial institutions fail although we have not recognized any material losses on our cash cash equivalents and other cash investments future declines in their market values or other unexpected losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

our sales and profitability depend to a large extent on the sale of drug products delivered by injection if the products developed by our customers in the future use another delivery system our sales and profitability could suffer 

our business depends to a substantial extent on customers continued sales and development of products that are delivered by injection if our customers fail to continue to sell develop and deploy new injectable products or we are unable to develop new products that assist in the delivery of drugs by alternative methods our sales and profitability may suffer 

if we are unable to provide comparative value advantages timely fulfillment of customer orders or resist pricing pressure we will have to reduce our prices which may negatively impact our profit margins 

we compete with several companies across our major product lines because of the special nature of these products competition is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive cost control programs across their entire operations competitors often compete on the basis of price we differentiate ourselves from our competition as a fullservice valueadded supplier that is able to provide presale compatibility studies and other services and sophisticated postsale technical support on a global basis however we face continued pricing pressure from our customers and competitors if we are unable to resist or to offset the effects of continued pricing pressure through our valueadded services improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures or if we have to reduce our prices our sales and profitability may suffer 

if we are unable to expand our production capacity at our european and asian facilities there may be a delay in fulfilling or we may be unable to fulfill customer orders and this could potentially reduce our sales and our profitability may suffer 

we have significant indebtedness and debt service payments which could negatively impact our liquidity 

we owe substantial debts and have to commit significant cash flow to debt service requirements the level of our indebtedness among other things could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to reduce our total indebtedness depends on the results of our product development efforts our future operating performance our ability to generate cash flow from the sale of our products and on general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors affecting our operations many of these factors are beyond our control and our future operating performance could be adversely affected by some or all of these factors 

if we incur new indebtedness in the future the related risks that we now face could intensify whether we are able to make required payments on our outstanding indebtedness and satisfy any other future debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance and our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing 

we are subject to regulation by governments around the world and if these regulations are not complied with existing and future operations may be curtailed and we could be subject to liability 

the design development manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our products and our customers’ products that incorporate our products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the united states europe and other countries including the fda and the european medicines agency the regulatory process can result in required modification or withdrawal of existing products and a substantial delay in the introduction of new products also it is possible that regulatory approval may not be obtained for a new product in addition our analytical laboratories perform certain contract services for drug manufacturers and are subject to the fdas current good manufacturing practices regulations we must also register as a contract laboratory with the fda and are subject to periodic inspections by the fda the drug enforcement administration has licensed our contract analytical laboratories to handle and store controlled substances failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in actions that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our business may be adversely affected by changes in the regulation of drug products and devices 

an effect of the governmental regulation of our customers’ drug products devices and manufacturing processes is that compliance with regulations makes it costly and time consuming for customers to substitute or replace components and devices produced by one supplier with those from another in general terms regulation of our customers’ products that incorporate our components and devices has increased over time however if the applicable regulations were to be modified in a way that reduced the cost and time involved for customers to substitute one supplier’s components or devices for those made by another it is likely that the competitive pressure on us would increase and adversely affect our sales and profitability 

our business may be adversely affected by risks typically encountered in international operations 

we conduct business in most of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world sales outside the us account for approximately 54 of consolidated net sales virtually all of these sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into us dollars which can result in significant increases or decreases in the amount of those sales or earnings the main currencies to which we are exposed besides the us dollar are the euro british pound and japanese yen the exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future in addition to translation risks we incur currency transaction gains or losses when we or one of our subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction in a currency other than that entity’s local currency 

international operations are also exposed to the following risks transportation delays and interruptions political and economic instability and disruptions imposition of duties and tariffs import and export controls the risks of divergent business expectations or cultural incompatibility inherent in establishing and maintaining operations in foreign countries difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations labor strikes andor disputes and potentially adverse tax consequences limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies with third parties or our joint venture partners outside of the us could also create exposure in addition we may not be able to operate in compliance with foreign laws and regulations or comply with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject in the event that these laws or regulations change 

any of these events could have an adverse effect on our international operations in the future by reducing the demand for our products decreasing the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

raw material and energy prices have a significant impact on our profitability if raw material andor energy prices increase and we cannot pass those price increases on to our customers our profitability and financial condition may suffer 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers which include synthetic and natural material aluminum and plastic in addition our manufacturing facilities consume a wide variety of energy products to fuel heat and cool our operations supply and demand factors which are beyond our control generally affect the price of our raw materials and utility costs if we are unable to pass along increased raw material prices and energy costs to our customers our profitability and thus our financial condition may be adversely affected the prices of many of these raw materials and utilities are cyclical and volatile for example the prices of certain commodities particularly petroleumbased raw materials have in the recent past exhibited rapid changes increasing the cost of synthetic elastomers and plastic while we generally attempt to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of sales price increases historically there has been a time delay between raw material andor energy price increases and our ability to increase the prices of our products in some circumstances we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pressure and other factors 

disruptions in the supply of key raw materials and difficulties in the supplier qualification process could adversely impact our operations 

we employ a supply chain management strategy in our reporting segments which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply this strategy has reduced the number of raw material suppliers used by us this increases the risk that our supply lines may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production problem or financial difficulties if one of our suppliers is unable to supply materials needed for our products or our strategies for managing these risks is unsuccessful we may be unable to complete the process of qualifying new replacement materials for some programs in time to meet future production needs prolonged disruptions in the supply of any of our key raw materials difficulty completing qualification of new sources of supply or in implementing the use of replacement materials or new sources of supply could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition or cash flows 

our operations must comply with environmental statutes and regulations and any failure to comply could result in extensive costs which would harm our business 

the manufacture of some of our products involves the use transportation storage and disposal of hazardous or toxic materials and is subject to various environmental protection and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate this has exposed us in the past and could expose us in the future to risks of accidental contamination and events of noncompliance with environmental laws any such occurrences could result in regulatory enforcement or personal injury and property damage claims or could lead to a shutdown of some of our operations which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations we currently incur costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations and these costs may become more significant 

a loss of key personnel or highly skilled employees could disrupt our operations 

our executive officers are critical to the management and direction of our businesses our future success depends in large part on our ability to retain these officers and other capable management personnel with the exception of our chief executive officer in general we do not enter into employment agreements with our executive officers we have entered into severance agreements with our officers that allow those officers to terminate their employment under particular circumstances such as a change of control affecting our company although we believe that we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise our inability to do so could disrupt the operations of the unit affected or our overall operations in addition because of the complex nature of many of our products and programs we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled engineering staff and workforce our operations could be disrupted by a shortage of available skilled employees 

difficulties experienced in the design or implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we are in the process of implementing sap an enterprise resource planning “erp” system over a multiyear period for our north american operations phase one of this implementation was completed in april 2008 and included the replacement of our financial reporting cash disbursement and ordertocash systems a second major phase of the sap project focusing on procurement and plant operations commenced in october 2008 and will continue through 2009 

our erp system is critical to our ability to accurately and efficiently maintain our books and records record transactions provide critical information to our management and prepare our financial statements we have invested and will continue to invest significant capital and human resources in the design and implementation of this system any disruptions or delays encountered during the implementation could adversely affect our ability to process and ship orders provide services and customer support bill and track customers fulfill contractual obligations and file quarterly or annual reports with the sec in a timely manner the resulting disruptions to our business could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows even if we do not encounter these difficulties the design and implementation of the new erp system may be more costly than we had originally anticipated

2008 financial performance highlights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recent trends and developments 

pharmaceutical systems 

the majority of our sales growth in recent years has been generated by the performance of pharmaceutical systems growth in 2008 was adversely affected by isolated regulatory and insurance reimbursement changes that decreased the demand for certain biotechnology customers’ products our decision to cease production of a lowmargin disposable medical product component and customer inventory management initiatives in response to the recent global economic turmoil despite these issues we were successful in replacing the lost sales and growing business through increased demand in certain global markets resulting in sales of 792 million an increase of 7 over the prior year pharmaceutical packaging components that include our postmanufacturing valueadded processes including westar® washing and flurotec® and b2 coatings continued to lead the demand for our products gross profit increased during the year to 266 million although the gross margin percentage decreased slightly due to the lost sales issues described above and the increased raw material and energy costs experienced during the year 

tech group 

our tech group segment had a challenging year in 2008 as it was forced to respond to the loss of revenues associated with the exubera inhalation device in october 2007 pfizer inc discontinued marketing exubera a pulmonary insulin product developed by our customer nektar therapeutics “nektar” and licensed to pfizer in addition to the lost business associated with exubera tech group experienced decreased demand for an overthecounter healthcare packaging product following a significant 2007 market launch at the same time we experienced stronger than expected demand for several other healthcare devices and consumer products tech group 2008 net sales were 271 million 6 lower than the prior year including the impact of lost exubera device sales of 33 million despite the drop in net sales operating profit increased 6 million or over 50 as a result of gains in production efficiency and savings from restructuring and costcutting activities 

in december 2007 we announced a restructuring plan for our tech group which proactively addressed anticipated changes in customers’ marketing plans for certain products and aligned our plant capacity and workforce with the business outlook and longerterm strategy of focusing the business on proprietary products as part of this plan we implemented a series of restructuring initiatives during 2008 to reduce production and engineering operations reduce administrative costs and consolidate our tool shops into one location during 2008 and 2007 we incurred restructuring costs totaling 3 million in each year and we will incur additional costs not expected to exceed 1 million during the first half of 2009 as we complete this program in the aggregate expected costs of this program consist of 4 million in severance and benefits for approximately 326 employees 2 million in assetrelated charges and 1 million for contract termination fees and other expenses estimated cost savings were approximately 5 million for 2008 and are expected to be approximately 6 to 7 million annually thereafter 

business outlook 

management’s operating priorities in 2009 will include a focus on generating organic growth improving operating margins and continuing to invest in the future now that the tech group restructuring is substantially completed and we have implemented other costreduction efforts throughout the organization we expect to realize incremental operating cost savings in 2009 we will continue to aggressively manage the costs under our control and take advantage of targeted restructuring activities where necessary our business outlook remains positive for both segments however we expect that sales growth will be hampered by the current global economic conditions 

pharmaceutical systems 

our 2009 revenue projections reflect the strengthening of the us dollar versus the euro and certain other international currencies during the fourth quarter of 2008 after taking into account an anticipated unfavorable foreign exchange impact of 8 we expect full year revenues for pharmaceutical systems to be marginally lower than those achieved in 2008 growth excluding the impact of currency is expected to continue to be driven by demand for our enhanced product offerings including westar® and advanced coated products prefillable syringe components and safety and administration systems we believe that the longterm drivers remain strong and market dynamics support future growth with an aging population advances in treatments for chronic illnesses many of which involve biologic drugs and a shift in the pointofcare from hospitals to specialty clinics and homes 

given our positive growth outlook we plan to continue funding the capital projects necessary to meet customer demand and to provide for improved results in our longerterm strategic plan during 2008 we made significant strides in increasing our plant capacity in germany serbia france singapore and the us we are also in the process of constructing a new facility in china which will manufacture plastic components for disposable medical products and we continue to evaluate opportunities for constructing rubber manufacturing facilities in china and india we expect our 2009 capital spending to be approximately equal to the 2008 level which will allow us to complete the ongoing expansion projects fund innovation for promising new products replace certain manufacturing and accounting information systems and maintain our existing facilities 

tech group 

we expect full year 2009 revenues to be lower than those in 2008 by 5 to 7 after taking into account an expected unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately 3 and lower plastic resin costs which are passed through to the majority of our contract customers in the form of selling price adjustments excluding the negative impact of these two items growth is expected to come from demand in healthcare devices and several new consumer product launches planned by our customers although tech group is projecting lower sales for 2009 we believe that the combination of a leaner cost structure made possible by restructuring initiatives and increased operating efficiency at our production facilities will provide for a consistent level of operating profit on a longerterm basis we believe that the tech group segment will benefit from our innovation initiatives in developing proprietary products incorporating new technologies and advanced injection systems with the expansion of our grand rapids michigan plant now completed the majority of our capital spending within the tech group will be focused on the support of new products and routine facility and equipment upgrades 

research  development “rd” and innovation 

we expect 2009 rd spending to surpass 2008 levels by approximately 25 as we continue to invest in advanced injectable packaging and delivery systems and safety and reconstitution products we anticipate that a majority of our developmental medical devices will be manufactured by our tech group and marketed by pharmaceutical systems we believe that our commitment to develop and apply proprietary technologies that improve the quality safety and effectiveness of therapeutic and diagnostic healthcare delivery systems will result in continued longterm growth 

global economic conditions 

current economic conditions in the us and abroad are expected to have a moderate impact on the sales growth of our products as customers search for ways to cut costs including rationalization of their inventories in addition we anticipate that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will have an unfavorable impact on consolidated sales of approximately 7 in 2009 after considering the unfavorable foreign currency impact we expect consolidated sales to be between 101 billion and 103 billion a reduction of 2 to 4 compared with those of 2008 excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency translation 2009 sales are expected to grow between 30 and 50 our financial projections for 2009 were prepared using a forecast of foreign currency exchange rates for our various nonus subsidiaries as such continued volatility in key exchange rates during 2009 may result in significant differences in us dollar results affecting the accuracy of our sales and earnings projections 

in addition to the impact on sales the slowing economy and adverse conditions in equity and debt markets contributed to a 25 decline in the value of our us pension assets compared to a longterm rate of return assumption of 8 as a result of this and other changes in pension assumptions we are expecting an incremental pension expense of approximately 10 million in 2009 continued actual returns below our expected rate may also affect the amount and timing of future contributions to the plan we have no erisa employee retirement income security act funding requirements in 2009 however we have made a voluntary pension contribution of 10 million in january 2009 

the global reach of our business and the nature of our product portfolio that serves primarily nondiscretionary pharmaceutical and medical applications are expected to limit the impact of temporary economic downturns however the world financial markets have recently experienced extreme disruption and global economic conditions have worsened accordingly no assurance can be given that the ongoing economic downturn will not have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products 

results of operations 

management’s discussion and analysis of our operating results for the three years ended december 31 2008 and our financial position as of december 31 2008 should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes appearing elsewhere in this report our financial statements include the results of acquired businesses for periods subsequent to their acquisition date for the purpose of aiding the comparison of our yeartoyear results reference is made in managements discussion and analysis to results excluding the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates those remeasured period results are not in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and are considered “nongaap financial measures” the nongaap financial measures are intended to explain or aid in the use of not as a substitute for the related gaap financial measures 

percentages in the following tables and throughout the results of operations section may reflect rounding adjustments 

net sales 

the following table summarizes net sales by reportable segment 

 

2008 compared to 2007 

consolidated 2008 net sales increased by 310 million or 30 over those achieved in the prior year favorable foreign currency translation accounted for the vast majority of the consolidated sales growth sales price increases contributed 23 percentage points to sales growth as price increases including raw material surcharges were implemented in response to rising raw material and energy costs during the year substantially offsetting the impact of sales price increases were lower volumes and unfavorable mix resulting from regulatory and insurance reimbursement related constraints and the discontinuation of certain products which resulted in lost sales within both reporting segments 

pharmaceutical systems  this segment contributed 503 million to the full year sales increase including 262 million resulting from favorable foreign currency translation excluding currency translation effects sales were 241 million or 33 above prior year levels price increases contributed approximately 23 percentage points of the sales increase over the prior year favorable sales volume and mix contributed 10 percentage point despite the loss of the discrete pharmaceutical packaging and disposable medical components sales described below 

sales of pharmaceutical packaging components were 450 million higher than the prior year due to increased sales of stoppers and seals used in a variety of customer products as well as favorable currency translation these increases more than compensated for a 174 million decline in sales of a prefillable syringe component caused by regulatory and insurance reimbursement changes affecting the demand for certain customer products designed to treat anemia in cancer and other patients sales of disposable medical components were 132 million lower as sales of other syringe components replaced a portion of the 136 million of 2007 sales of a lowmargin blood collection system component that we ceased producing sales of safety and administration systems and laboratory and other services were 185 million higher than the prior year most of which was due to increased demand for our drug reconstitution products and higher tooling activity 

tech group  full year sales were 187 million below 2007 levels including 36 million of favorable foreign currency translation excluding the impact of foreign currency translation sales were 223 million or 77 below prior year levels price increases contributed 24 percentage points to sales while increased consumer products sales volume offset a small portion of the lost exubera device business 

sales of healthcare devices decreased 171 million compared with the prior year after considering the lost exubera sales of 33 million we experienced increased sales volume of other healthcare devices including medical filter products selfinjection pens and intranasal drug delivery systems partially offset by a dropoff in sales of packaging for a customer’s overthecounter weight loss product following a june 2007 market launch sales of consumer products tooling and other services decreased by 16 million due to lower demand for certain personal care products and tooling services partially offset by increased volume of juice and dairy carton closures intersegment sales of 111 million and 105 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively were eliminated in consolidation 

2007 compared to 2006 

consolidated 2007 net sales increased by 1068 million or 117 over those achieved in 2006 foreign currency translation accounted for 414 million or 45 percentage points of the sales growth excluding foreign currency translation 2007 net sales increased 654 million or 72 over the prior year 

pharmaceutical systems  the pharmaceutical systems segment contributed 977 million of the full year sales increase including 378 million resulting from favorable foreign currency translation excluding foreign currency translation pharmaceutical systems sales were 599 million or 93 above prior year levels price increases contributed approximately 25 percentage points of the sales increase over the prior year with the remainder of the increase attributed to positive sales volume sales growth was strong in all geographical regions of the segment driven by increased demand for serum stoppers used in vial packaging for vaccines injectable treatments for chronic diseases and increased demand for prefilled injection system components 

tech group  full year sales in 2007 were 100 million above prior year levels 36 million of which resulted from foreign currency translation excluding foreign currency translation tech group segment sales were 64 million or 23 above prior year levels price increases contributed approximately 08 percentage points of the sales increase in the tech group with the remainder of the increase attributed to positive sales volume the tech group sales increase included a 36 million increase in sales to nektar of the exubera device resulting from the timing of the product launch by pfizer in the us earlier in the year tech group sales also benefited from strong sales of weight loss product packaging an intranasal delivery system and surgery devices but these were largely offset by a 132 million decline in revenue from tooling and design projects intersegment sales of 105 million and 98 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively were eliminated in consolidation 

gross profit 

the following table summarizes our gross profit and related gross margins by reportable segment 

 

2008 compared to 2007 

consolidated gross profit increased by 108 million over 2007 including the favorable effect from foreign currency translation of 94 million the gross margin percentage improved slightly despite the unfavorable impact on sales volume and mix caused by the loss of discrete business described in the net sales section above 

pharmaceutical systems  gross margin for pharmaceutical systems declined by one percentage point versus the prior year approximately half of this decrease was due to unfavorable volume and mix resulting from the regulatory and insurance reimbursement issues affecting the demand for prefillable syringe components used in certain anemia products the remaining decline resulted from increased depreciation expense and production cost increases as the positive benefit of sales price increases offset a majority of the increased costs of raw materials wage increases and utilities used to operate our production facilities 

tech group  gross margins improved by 14 percentage points in comparison to prior year results the improved gross margin performance was largely due to a significant reduction in plant overhead and improved production efficiency which contributed 34 percentage points these gains resulted from our restructuring efforts and efficiencies from the completion of startup activities at our expanded production facility in michigan partially offsetting these increases by 15 percentage points was the impact of lower sales and unfavorable mix despite sales increases in consumer products and other healthcare devices the loss of business associated with the exubera device and the prior year weight loss product launch resulted in a decline in sales and negative impact on gross margin during the year the majority of raw material energy and wage cost increases were passed on to customers in the form of increased selling prices 

2007 compared to 2006 

consolidated 2007 gross profit increased by 270 million over 2006 consisting of a 318 million increase in pharmaceutical systems segment gross profit and a 48 million decrease in tech group segment gross profit foreign currency translation accounted for 129 million of the increase in consolidated gross profit 

pharmaceutical systems  the gross margin within the pharmaceutical systems segment declined moderately compared to that achieved in 2006 primarily due to higher plant overhead costs including the addition of engineering and other staff in support of our expansion projects increased manufacturing supply and maintenance costs resulting from strained capacity levels at several facilities in europe and higher depreciation charges on machinery and equipment upgrades 

tech group  the tech group segment gross profit and gross margin declines primarily reflect 60 million of incremental costs associated with the relocation and startup of our new facility in michigan 

research and development “rd” costs 

the following table summarizes rd costs by reportable segment 

 

rd costs during 2008 were 26 million higher than those incurred in 2007 mostly due to three ongoing development projects in the pharmaceutical systems segment the first is our development of prefillable syringe systems that will use daikyo seiko ltd “daikyo” crystal zenith® resin a unique transparent polymer that can be used to produce vials and syringe barrels daikyo our 25 owned affiliate in japan is also our partner in a longstanding marketing and technology transfer agreement that enables west and daikyo to develop products that help customers mitigate drug product development risks and enhance drug performance and patient safety the other major projects include an advanced injection system using autoinjector technology which was acquired during 2007 and a passive needle safety device 

the increase in 2007 over 2006 rd costs reflected the formation of our innovation group which is responsible for seeking new opportunities in injectable packaging and delivery systems our development projects are a response to the market opportunities created by the convergence of primary drug packaging and delivery systems and include initiatives in traditional injection systems components for pen system applications and auto injectors with cartridges 

selling general and administrative “sga” costs 

the following table summarizes sga costs by reportable segment including corporate and unallocated costs 

 

2008 compared to 2007 

consolidated sga expenses were 68 million above those recorded in 2007 but only increased marginally as a percentage of total net sales the impact of foreign currency translation accounted for 33 million of the increase 

in pharmaceutical systems 2008 sga expenses increased by 118 million over the prior year foreign currency translation accounted for 31 million of the increase compensation costs were 44 million above those incurred in 2007 due to the impact of annual pay increases and increased staffing of information technology support functions costs associated with our new information systems implementation including depreciation expense and thirdparty consulting fees accounted for 23 million of the increase various other increases including utilities and other corporate facilities costs contributed to the remaining increase in sga expense 

sga costs in the tech group were 41 million lower than the amount incurred in 2007 a net reduction in headcount associated with our restructuring efforts accounted for half of the reduction in sga the remainder of the reduction was attributable to lower amortization expense resulting from the 2007 nektar contract intangible writeoff and a reduction in various thirdparty consulting services 

general corporate sga costs were 21 million favorable to 2007 levels these costs include executive and director compensation and other corporate administrative and facilities expenses the majority of the decrease is the result of lower facilities and administrativerelated costs also included in corporate sga are any above or belowtarget performance adjustments for our worldwide cash bonus program annual cash bonus payments are made based on the achievement of sales operating profit earnings per share and cash flow targets and certain qualitative performance milestones 2008 cashbased bonus costs were slightly lower than those earned in the prior year based upon management’s achievement of targets 

stockbased compensation costs for 2008 increased by 13 million due to the impact of changes in our stock price on the fair value of our stockprice indexed deferred compensation liabilities during 2008 our stock price decreased 282 per share closing at 3777 per share on december 31 2008 while during 2007 our stock price decreased 1064 per share closing at 4059 per share on december 31 2007 the costs of nonus pension and other retirement benefits programs are reflected in the operating profit of the respective segment for all periods presented 

2007 compared to 2006 

consolidated sga expenses in 2007 were 47 million above those recorded in 2006 in the pharmaceutical systems segment 2007 sga expenses increased by 165 million compared to the prior year approximately 61 million of the increase was compensation related including increased staffing of sales strategic marketing and information systems functions the impact of annual salary increases and higher incentive compensation program costs foreign currency translation accounted for 46 million of the 2007 to 2006 increase in pharmaceutical system segment sga costs professional service and consulting costs related to the implementation of new information systems in the us and sales commission charges were 41 million higher in 2007 than in 2006 the remaining 17 million increase in sga costs consisted mostly of higher software maintenance computer related supply costs and depreciation expense 

2007 sga costs in the tech group segment were 27 million above the prior year higher staffing levels in quality control human resource and other functions together with annual salary increases accounted for 14 million of the growth sales commissions were 06 million higher than in 2006 foreign currency translation travel costs and bad debt expense contributed equally to the remaining 07 million increase 

general corporate sga costs were 28 million lower in 2007 than in 2006 incentive compensation costs in 2007 were 29 million lower than the prior year primarily due to the achievement of above target performance levels resulting in above target bonus payouts in 2006 compared to 2007 incentive compensation which was below target 

stockbased compensation costs for 2007 decreased by 94 million when compared to those recorded in 2006 due primarily to a decrease in west stockprice indexed compensation costs partially offset by higher stock option and employee stock purchase plan costs our stock price decreased 1064 per share during 2007 closing at 4059 per share on december 31 2007 in 2006 our stock price increased 2620 per share closing at 5123 per share at december 31 2006 

us pension plan expenses in 2007 were 23 million lower than those incurred during 2006 the decrease largely resulted from a 2006 amendment to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in the us under the amended plan benefits earned under the plan’s pension formulas were frozen as of december 31 2006 and replaced with new cashbalance formulas resulting in a reduction of our projected benefit obligation 

restructuring impairment and other items 

other income and expense items consisting of gains losses or impairments of segment assets foreign exchange transaction gains and losses miscellaneous royalties and sundry transactions are generally recorded within the respective segment certain restructuring and other items considered outside the control of segment management are not allocated to our reporting segments the following table summarizes our restructuring charges and other income and expense items for each of the three years ended december 31 

 

the yearoveryear reduction in other expense for pharmaceutical systems is attributable to net foreign exchange gains on intercompany and thirdparty transactions recognized during 2008 other expense in 2006 included a 25 million impairment charge for productive assets and royalties stemming from a discontinued product after taking this charge into consideration the amounts recognized in 2007 and 2006 are fairly consistent for tech group the reduction in other expense in 2007 versus 2006 resulted from the recognition of income from 2007 government grants in europe the majority of tech group other expense in 2006 related to the sale or disposal of surplus equipment the miscellaneous charges recorded in 2008 corporate expense represent foreign exchange transaction losses 

impairment charge contract settlement and related gain net  in the fourth quarter of 2007 we recorded a 129 million impairment charge representing our net book value in the nektar contract intangible asset associated with the exubera device under an agreement reached with nektar in february 2008 we received full reimbursement for among other things severance related employee costs equipment purchased raw materials and components leases and other facility costs associated with the shutdown of manufacturing operations related to this device during 2008 we received payments from nektar which more than offset the related costs incurred resulting in a net gain of 42 million 

restructuring and related charges  we incurred 30 million and 34 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively of restructuring and related charges as part of our 2007 plan to align the plant capacity and workforce of the tech group with the revised business outlook for that segment we expect to incur additional amounts not to exceed 10 million during the first half of 2009 as these restructuring activities are concluded 

brazil excise tax and other charges  during 2007 we increased our accruals for a series of social excise and other tax contingencies in brazil by 101 million these charges followed a detailed review of several related tax cases pending in the brazilian courts which indicated that it was probable that our positions taken on previous tax returns some of which date back to the late 1990’s would not be sustained this matter is currently awaiting final disposition in the brazilian court system 

operating profit 

operating profit loss by reportable segment corporate and other unallocated costs was as follows 

 

2008 compared to 2007 

pharmaceutical systems operating profit was lower than prior year results by 52 million including a foreign currency translation benefit of 55 million the impact of higher sales and gross profit was more than offset by higher spending on information systems and research and development initiatives as we replace outdated management reporting systems and invest in innovative products for the future 

tech group operating profit was 62 million above that achieved in the prior year including a foreign currency benefit of 03 million largely due to savings resulting from the restructuring program initiated in late 2007 and production efficiencies coming from higher throughput at our newly expanded michigan facility 

general corporate costs declined as a result of lower compensation costs under our annual performancebased bonus plan and stockbased compensation costs increased due to the impact of changes in our stock price on deferred compensation obligations which are indexed to our stock price 

other unallocated income for 2008 totaled 12 million consisting of a 30 million restructuring charge and 42 million in proceeds less costs of transition activities at our former exubera device production facility other unallocated expense for 2007 was 264 million including a 34 million restructuring charge a 129 million impairment loss on our customer contract intangible for the exubera device and a 101 million provision for social excise and other tax liabilities in brazil 

2007 compared to 2006 

our 2007 consolidated operating profit decreased by 61 million from that achieved in 2006 operating profit for 2007 included 264 million in unallocated costs as described above the pharmaceutical systems segment’s 2007 results exceed those of the prior year by 122 million benefiting from sales growth a favorable product mix and the 76 million impact of foreign currency translation which combined to more than offset other cost increases 

tech group segment operating profit was 65 million below that achieved in the prior year largely due to costs incurred during the relocation and validation of a newly expanded production facility in michigan 

general corporate stockbased compensation and us pension plan costs were all lower than those incurred in the prior year with the significant decrease in stockprice indexed deferred compensation programs attributed to the decline in our stock price during 2007 compared to the strong increase in stock price experienced in 2006 

loss on debt extinguishment 

on february 27 2006 we prepaid 1000 million in senior notes carrying a 681 interest rate and a maturity date of april 8 2009 under the terms of the original note purchase agreement dated april 8 1999 the prepayment of the notes entitled note holders to a “make whole” amount of 59 million in order to compensate them for interest rate differentials between the 681 yield on the notes and current market rates for the remaining term of the note the prepayment was financed by issuing €815 million approximately 1000 million of new senior unsecured notes at a weighted average interest rate of 434 before costs 

interest expense net 

the following table summarizes our net interest expense 

 

2008 compared to 2007 

interest expense for 2008 before capitalized interest and interest income was 22 million above that recorded in the prior year the timing of our issuance of 1615 million in convertible debt in march and april of 2007 accounted for 13 million of the yeartodate increase as the notes were outstanding for the entire 2008 year compared to a partial year in 2007 the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and bank commitment fees accounted for another 10 million of the increase the decrease in interest income is also largely due to the timing of the convertible debt issuance as a portion of the proceeds was invested in money market accounts and a strategic cash management fund in the first half of 2007 and then subsequently used in our stock buyback program and in our capital expansion programs in addition interest income was reduced by otherthantemporary losses on our strategic cash management fund investment totaling 14 million in 2008 capitalized interest increased as a result of our pharmaceutical systems capital expansion projects in europe 

2007 compared to 2006 

our 2007 net interest expense was 21 million lower than that incurred in 2006 due largely to refinancing and investing activities and higher capitalized interest on our capital expansion projects in europe and in michigan during 2007 we issued 1615 million of convertible debt at a 4 fixed interest rate interest expense on the convertible notes totaled 53 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the incremental interest expense from the convertible notes was partially offset in the comparison of the 2007 and 2006 periods by favorable rate and volume variances totaling 13 million and 10 million respectively resulting from reduced borrowing levels on our revolving credit facility and our 2006 refinancing activities our 2007 interest income is 39 million favorable to that recorded in 2006 the additional interest income was generated from the investment of a substantial portion of the proceeds from our convertible debt offering 

income taxes 

our effective tax rate was 216 in 2008 199 in 2007 and 291 in 2006 the following factors impacted the comparability of the tax rate in 2008 versus 2007 

 

 

 

 

 

the impact of these items reduced our effective tax rate by 32 percentage points in 2008 and 95 percentage points in 2007 after considering these items the remaining decrease in the 2008 effective tax rate was primarily due to a change in mix of earnings to jurisdictions where we are subject to lower tax rates and an increase in rd tax benefits in the us and ireland 

in addition to the 2007 factors listed above the following items impacted the comparability of the tax rate in 2007 versus 2006 

 

 

the combined impact of these two items reduced our 2006 effective tax rate by 14 percentage points after considering these items the remaining decrease in the 2007 effective tax rate was primarily due to a change in mix of foreign versus us earnings 

equity in net income of affiliates 

equity in net income from our 25 ownership interest in daikyo in japan and our 49 ownership interest in three companies in mexico was 08 million 25 million and 19 million for the years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively our 2008 equity income was 17 million lower than the prior year due to reduced earnings of daikyo the lower earnings were primarily the result of plant demolition and disposal costs as well as incremental depreciation expense associated with a significant crystal zenith® capital expansion project and higher pension costs 

the increase in equity earnings in 2007 versus 2006 came from daikyo as their net income was 06 million above that recorded in 2006 daikyo’s sales were 5 above prior year levels their gross margins improved by three percentage points and there were no unusual charges in 2007 unlike 2006 when a 07 million charge was incurred related to a decision by daikyo to demolish an existing facility these favorable items were partially offset by a loss on sale of an investment security 

purchases from affiliates totaled 363 million in 2008 313 million in 2007 and 241 million in 2006 the majority of which relate to a distributorship agreement with daikyo which allows us to purchase and resell daikyo products sales to affiliates were 17 million 09 million and 08 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

income from continuing operations 

net income from continuing operations in 2008 was 860 million or 250 per diluted share our 2008 results included a net gain on contract settlement proceeds of 42 million restructuring and related charges of 30 million and discrete income tax benefits of 35 million collectively these items totaled 12 million pretax 43 million after tax or 012 per diluted share 

net income from continuing operations in 2007 was 712 million or 206 per diluted share our 2007 results include the impact of restructuring charges an impairment loss on our customer contract intangible asset with nektar and our provisions for brazilian tax issues which collectively totaled 264 million pretax 194 million after tax or 054 per diluted share also included in 2007 results was the recognition of discrete tax benefits totaling 82 million or 023 per diluted share after considering the impact of these items income from continuing operations in 2008 was slightly above the prior year amount 

2006 net income from continuing operations was 615 million or 183 per diluted share our 2006 results included a 59 million pretax loss on debt extinguishment 41 million after tax or 012 per diluted share and the favorable resolution of a claim for a tax refund associated with the disposition of our former plastic molding facility in puerto rico this resulted in the recognition in income from continuing operations of 06 million or 002 per diluted share consisting of a 04 million tax benefit and related interest income net of tax of 02 million 

discontinued operations 

our 2007 results included a 05 million provision for claims anticipated from the 2005 divestiture of our former drug delivery business 

our 2006 income from discontinued operations was 56 million or 017 per diluted share as a result of a favorable outcome to our claim for tax benefits relating to the 2001 sale of our former contract manufacturing and packaging business we received a tax refund resulting in the recognition of a 40 million tax benefit the settlement of this claim also resulted in pretax interest income of 06 million 04 million after taxes we also recognized a 12 million favorable adjustment to tax accruals associated with our former drug delivery systems segment primarily as a result of the closure of the 2002 us federal tax audit year 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows 

the following table and explanations provide cash flow data from continuing operations for the years ended december 31 

 

cash flows from operating activities  our 2008 operating cash flows increased 58 million compared to the prior year including 167 million in proceeds received from our contract settlement with nektar partially offset by related cash costs of 70 million our favorable cash flow from operating results and the impact of this contract settlement was reduced by the 2008 payment of income and other taxrelated liabilities in brazil totaling 127 million operating cash flows in 2007 also reflected unusually high payments related to tax issues in brazil during 2007 we paid 117 million to escrow representing judicial deposits for the benefit of the brazil government to avoid further accretion of interest and penalties on taxrelated liabilities after considering these items the 2008 cash flows from operating activities were slightly lower than 2007 as increased earnings in 2008 were offset by cash outflows for changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities 

cash flow from operations in 2007 decreased 102 million versus 2006 cash flow in 2007 was reduced by the 117 million payment to escrow for the benefit of the brazil government our operating cash flow in 2006 included the impact of a 59 million “makewhole” payment incurred as part of the extinguishment of our former senior note agreement 

cash flows from investing activities – in 2008 cash flows used in investing activities were 277 million less despite a 92 million increase in capital spending and the acquisition of the remaining minority ownership 10 of the medimop companies for 85 million the majority of the yearoveryear decrease resulted from 168 million in redemptions from the columbia strategic cash portfolio fund compared to 227 million in net purchases in 2007 our investment in this enhanced money fund which began an orderly liquidation in december 2007 is discussed in more detail in note 14 fair value measurements  to the consolidated financial statements in 2007 compared to 2006 the majority of the increase in cash flows used in investing activities resulted from increased capital spending 

capital spending in 2008 totaled 1386 million a 92 million increase over the prior year pharmaceutical systems spending was 1223 million an increase of 142 million over the prior year the increase is related to major projects to increase our manufacturing capacity including the expansion of our rubber compounding capacity in kinston north carolina and ongoing plant expansion projects in europe and asia a portion of the total spending increase pertains to information technology as we replaced our financial reporting cash disbursements and ordertocash systems in north america the second phase of this project focusing on procurement and plant operations is currently in progress and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2009 tech group capital spending was 92 million a decrease of 117 million compared to the prior year spending in 2007 was higher due to our grand rapids michigan plant expansion project the remainder of the change relates to a 68 million decrease in the 2008 balance of accrued capital spending compared to the december 31 2007 balance 

capital spending in 2007 totaled 1294 million a 391 million increase over 2006 pharmaceutical systems added 1081 million in capital compared to 623 million in 2006 the increase was largely due to significant projects to expand the molding production and tooling capacity at our existing facilities in europe and singapore our 2007 capital spending also included 99 million in connection with the construction of a new manufacturing facility in china and 77 million for information system projects in north america tech group 2007 capital spending was 209 million compared to 267 million in 2006 during 2007 we completed our plant relocation and expansion project in michigan other 2007 investing cash flows included an acquisition of patents and other technologyrelated assets totaling 47 million 

cash flows from financing activities – in 2008 the majority of the yearoveryear decrease in cash flows from financing activities resulted from the 2007 issuance of longterm debt partially offset by stock repurchase activity cash flows used in financing activities for 2008 included 123 million in net repayment of borrowings under our revolving debt facility and 31 million in new issuances of shortterm notes payable we paid cash dividends totaling 186 million 057 per share during the current year compared to 175 million and 159 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively we expect to continue our quarterly dividend program subject to annual board of directors’ approval 

cash flows provided by financing activities for 2007 included the issuance of 1615 million of convertible junior subordinated debentures carrying a 4 coupon rate and due in march of 2047 resulting in net cash proceeds of 1563 million after payment of underwriting and other costs of 52 million these net proceeds provided funds used in the reduction of revolving credit facility borrowings totaling 191 million during 2007 we initiated and completed an openmarket repurchase program under which we acquired 980300 shares of common stock at total cost of 394 million 4023 per share 

liquidity measures 

the table below displays key liquidity measures for west as of december 31 

 

shortterm investments that have maturities of ninety days or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities current ratio is defined as the ratio of current assets to current liabilities net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents and total invested capital is defined as the sum of net debt minority interests and shareholders equity the majority of the change in key liquidity measures in 2007 compared to 2006 resulted from the 2007 issuance of convertible debt net of our share buyback activity in that year 

included in other current assets and working capital at december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 were 93 million and 105 million respectively held in escrow representing judicial deposits to the government of brazil the liability associated with these tax exposures was recorded in taxes other than income on the consolidated balance sheets and was also reflected as a component of working capital in the table above 

based on our business outlook and our capital structure at the close of 2008 we believe that we have ample liquidity to fund our business needs new product development capital expansion pension and other postretirement benefits and to pay dividends our 2009 capital spending budget is set at approximately 1400 million a portion of which could be reduced at our discretion if global economic conditions worsen or our market outlook changes drastically 

we expect that our cash requirements for the foreseeable future will be met primarily through our cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents on hand and amounts available under our 2000 million multicurrency unsecured committed revolving credit agreement which we generally use for working capital requirements as of december 31 2008 we had available 1650 million of borrowing capacity under this facility and we have not experienced any limit on our ability to access this source of funds this facility expires in 2011 and market conditions at that time could affect the cost and terms of the replacement facility as well as terms of other debt instruments we enter into from time to time 

current market conditions 

current global economic conditions and instability in the financial markets have increased our exposure to the possible liquidity and default risks of our vendors suppliers and other counterparties with which we conduct business we expect that some of our customers and vendors may experience difficulty in obtaining the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials we periodically monitor our customers’ and key vendors’ financial condition and assess their liquidity in order to mitigate our counterparty risks if our key suppliers are unable to provide raw materials needed for our products we may be unable to fulfill sales orders in a timely manner due to the rigorous qualification process to date we have not experienced any significant increase in customer collectibility risks nor have we experienced increased supply risks due to vendor insolvency we do not expect that recent global credit market conditions will have a significant impact on our liquidity however the world financial markets have recently experienced extreme disruption accordingly no assurance can be given that the ongoing economic downturn will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or capital resources 

commitments and contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments at december 31 2008 these obligations are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity 

 

 

reserves for uncertain tax positions  the table above does not include 79 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately 10 million of associated accrued interest as of december 31 2008 due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods and amounts which may be paid 

letters of credit  we have letters of credit totaling 51 million supporting the reimbursement of workers’ compensation and other claims paid on our behalf by insurance carriers and to guarantee equipment lease payments in ireland and the payment of sales tax liabilities in the us the accrual for insurance obligations was 52 million at december 31 2008 

purchase obligations – our business creates a need to enter into various commitments with suppliers in accordance with gaap these unconditional purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets these purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements and are in the normal course of business 

foreign currency contracts – we periodically enter into foreign currency contracts to reduce our exposure to variability in cash flows related to anticipated purchases of raw materials and other inventory denominated in nonfunctional currencies we also enter into forward exchange contracts to mitigate exposure of nonfunctional currency asset and liability balances to changes in exchange rates as of december 31 2008 these hedges resulted in a combined liability at a fair value of 20 million which is not reflected in the above table 

pensionother postretirement obligations – our objective in funding the domestic taxqualified pension plan is to accumulate funds sufficient to provide for all benefits and to satisfy the minimum contribution requirements of erisa our annual funding decision also takes into account the extent to which the benefit obligation exceeds its corresponding funded status outside of the us our objective is to fund the retirement costs over time within the limits of minimum requirements and allowable tax deductions the table above reflects a voluntary contribution made in january 2009 to the us qualified pension plan of 100 million the amounts and timing of future company contributions to the defined benefit and other postretirement pension plans are unknown because they are dependent on pension fund asset performance as well as other factors the nonqualified defined benefit pension plans and postretirement medical plans are generally not funded in advance 

offbalance sheet agreements 

at december 31 2008 the company had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business and outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs and leased equipment and sales tax liability guarantees as noted above 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions some of which are subjective and complex that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our results of operations and financial position 

revenue recognition   the majority of our revenue is generated from our product manufacturing operations which convert rubber metal and plastic raw materials into parts used in closure systems and syringe components for use with injectable drugs and drug delivery devices sales of manufactured components are recorded at the time title and risk of loss passes to the customer some customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes management records rebate costs when the sales occur based on its assessment of the likelihood that these volumes will be attained we also establish product return liabilities for customer quality claims when such amounts are deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated 

impairment of longlived assets we review goodwill and other longlived assets annually and whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment as part of the reporting unit to which it belongs our reporting units are the same as our operating segments which we have determined to be the americas and europeasia pacific divisions of the pharmaceutical systems segment and the americas and europe divisions of the tech group segment for assets held and used in the business management estimates the future cash flows to be derived from the related asset or business unit when assets are held for sale management determines fair value by estimating the anticipated proceeds to be received upon the sale of the asset less disposition costs changes in the estimate of fair value including the estimate of future cash flows could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position 

employee benefits the measurement of the annual cost and obligations under our defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plans is subject to a number of assumptions sfas 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” as amended by sfas 158 requires companies to use an expected longterm rate of asset return assumption for computing current year pension expense for us plans which account for 91 of global plan assets the longterm rate of return assumption was 80 in 2008 and the prior two years this assumption is reviewed annually and determined by the projected return for our target mix of plan assets approximately 65 equity and 35 debt securities differences between the actual and expected returns are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently amortized into earnings as actuarial gains or losses sfas 87 also requires companies to discount future obligations back to today’s dollars using an appropriate discount rate the discount rate selected is the single rate equivalent for a theoretical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that produces a cash flow pattern equivalent to our plans’ projected benefit payments an increase in the discount rate decreases the pension benefit obligation this decrease is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently amortized into earnings as an actuarial gain 

changes in key assumptions including the market performance of plan assets and other actuarial assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position we estimate that every 25 basis point reduction in the longterm rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by 03 million and a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase pension expense by 05 million 

the discount rate used in determining the us pension plans’ benefit obligation at december 31 2008 increased 25 basis points to 650 to reflect market conditions at that time as of december 31 2008 pretax actuarial losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to pension and other retirement benefits were 966 million including a current year actuarial loss of 522 million which was the result of poor investment performance we estimate that the impact of these actuarial losses will increase our 2009 pension expense by approximately 10 million compared with the current year 

on december 31 2006 we adopted sfas no 158 “employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans—an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” sfas 158 requires the recognition of an asset or liability for the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as measured by the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation for a pension plan the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation for any other postretirement plan such as a retiree health plan the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 

due to poor investment performance during 2008 our funded status has been negatively impacted as the value of our plan assets has declined significantly partially offsetting this was an increase in our weighted average discount rate which lowered our pension plan liability based on full year negative plan asset returns as of december 31 2008 and a weighted average discount rate of 646 we were required to recognize a net pension underfunded balance of 730 million compared to 148 million at december 31 2007 and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of 349 million aftertax our underfunded balance for other postretirement benefits was 150 million and 141 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

income taxes   we estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation in addition deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established to recognize differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities we maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized the recoverability of tax assets is subject to our estimates of future profitability generally at the respective subsidiary company and country level changes in tax legislation business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined 

on january 1 2007 we adopted fin 48 this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements fin 48 prescribes a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the adoption of fin 48 resulted in the recognition of net tax assets that met the morelikelythannot threshold of 216 million and was reflected as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for 2007 

please refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 18 new accounting standards  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included within item 8 of this report for additional information on accounting and reporting standards considered in the preparation and presentation of our financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

we are exposed to various market risk factors such as fluctuating interest rates and foreign currency rate fluctuations these risk factors can impact results of operations cash flows and financial position from time to time we manage these risks using derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts derivatives used by us are highly effective as all of the critical terms of the derivative instruments match the hedged item effectiveness is measured on a quarterly basis in accordance with company policy derivative financial instruments are not used for speculation or trading purposes all debt securities and derivative instruments are considered nontrading 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have subsidiaries outside the us accounting for approximately 54 of consolidated net sales virtually all of these sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into us dollars although the majority of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are in the local currency of the subsidiary they may also hold assets or liabilities not denominated in their local currency these items may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains and losses as a result our results of operations and financial position are exposed to changing exchange rates we periodically use forward contracts to hedge certain transactions or to neutralize monthend balance sheet exposures on crosscurrency intercompany loans 

we have entered into a series of foreign currency hedge contracts which are designed to eliminate the currency risk associated with forecasted us dollar usd denominated inventory purchases made by certain european subsidiaries as of december 31 2008 there were eleven monthly contracts outstanding at 09 million each for an aggregate notional amount of 99 million the fair value of these contracts at december 31 2008 was 05 million and was recorded within other current liabilities the last contract matures on december 15 2009 the contracts effectively fix the euro to usd exchange rate for 40 of our anticipated needs at a maximum of 12800 usd per euro while allowing us to benefit from any currency movement between 12800 and 14620 usd per euro as of december 31 2008 the euro was equal to 14094 usd 

in addition to these contracts we have other forward exchange contracts hedging various obligations for a fair value of 15 million at december 31 2008 

we have designated our €815 million eurodenominated notes as a hedge of our investment in the net assets of our european operations a cumulative foreign currency translation loss of 91 million net of tax of 57 million on the €815 million debt is recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income as of december 31 2008 we also have a 27 billion yendenominated note payable which has been designated as a hedge of our investment in a japanese affiliate at december 31 2008 a foreign currency translation loss on the yendenominated debt of 44 million net of tax of 27 million is included within accumulated other comprehensive income 

interest rate risk 

as a result of our normal borrowing activities we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates which we manage primarily through our financing activities we have longterm debt with both fixed and variable interest rates longterm debt consists of senior notes convertible debentures revolving credit facilities and capital lease obligations portions of longterm debt which are payable during 2009 are classified as shortterm liabilities as of december 31 2008 

the following table summarizes our interest rate risksensitive instruments 

 

1 as of december 31 2008 we have two interest rate swap agreements outstanding which are designed to protect against volatility in variable interest rates payable on a 500 million note maturing on july 28 2012 “series a note” and a 250 million note maturing july 28 2015 “series b note” the first interestrate swap agreement has a notional amount of 500 million and corresponds to the maturity date of the series a note and the second interest rate swap agreement has a notional amount of 250 million and corresponds with the maturity date of the series b note under each of the swap agreements we will receive variable interest rate payments based on threemonth libor in return for making quarterly fixed payments including the applicable margin the interestrate swap agreements effectively fix the interest rates payable on series a and b notes payable at 532 and 551 respectively at december 31 2008 the interest rateswap agreements had a fair value of 82 million unfavorable to the company and are recorded as a noncurrent liability

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

the management of west pharmaceutical services inc the “company” is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 based on the framework established in “internal controlintegrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso based on this assessment management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2008 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered pubic accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein 

changes in internal controls 

we are in the process of implementing sap an enterprise resource planning “erp” system over a multiyear period for our north american operations during the second quarter of 2008 we successfully replaced our financial reporting cash disbursement and ordertocash systems the second phase of this sap project will focus on procurement and plant operations the implementation of the second phase started in late 2008 and is expected to continue on a plantbyplant basis through 2009 these implementations have resulted in certain changes to business processes and internal controls impacting financial reporting we have evaluated the control environment as affected by this project and believe that our controls remained effective 

during the period covered by this report there have been no other changes to our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

business segments 

we have two reportable segments pharmaceutical systems and tech group the pharmaceutical systems segment includes the results of the acquired medimop and monarch businesses the tech group segment includes the results of the acquired businesses of tgi 

comparative segment revenues and related financial information for 2006 2005 and 2004 are presented in a table contained in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements segment information  and the section headed results of operations in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of this 2006 form 10k 

pharmaceutical systems segment 

our pharmaceutical systems segment designs manufactures and sells a variety of elastomer and metal components used in parenteral drug delivery for the branded pharmaceutical generic and biopharmaceutical industries and is one of the world’s largest independent manufacturers of pharmaceutical packaging components stoppers plungers and seals the primary components we manufacture are subject to regulatory oversight within our customers’ manufacturing facilities we have manufacturing facilities in north and south america europe and asia pacific with affiliated companies in mexico and japan see item 2 properties  for additional information on our manufacturing sites 

our pharmaceutical systems segment consists of two operating segments—the americas and europeasia pacific—which are aggregated for reporting purposes because they have similar economic characteristics as well as similar products manufacturing processes customer objectives distribution procedures and regulatory requirements 

our pharmaceutical systems business is composed of the following product lines 

·   elastomeric stoppers and discs which serve as primary closures for pharmaceutical vials

·   secondary closures for pharmaceutical vials called flipoff® aluminum seals consisting of an aluminum seal and removable plastic button and in some applications just an aluminum seal

·   elastomeric syringe plungers stoppers for blood collection systems and flashback bulbs and sleeve stoppers for intravenous dispensing systems

·   elastomer and comolded elastomerplastic components for infusion iv sets

·   dropper bulbs—including tamperevident droppers—for applications such as eye ear and nasal drops diagnostic products and dispensing systems

·   needle shields and tip caps to fit most standard prefilled syringes and combination seals for dental cartridges and pens 

·   baby bottle nipple and pacifier bulbs from a variety of elastomeric formulations

our elastomeric components are offered in a variety of standard and customerspecific configurations and formulations these components are available with advanced barrier films and coatings to enhance their performance flurotec® is a flurorcarbon film which is applied to rubber stoppers and plungers using a patented molding process this film helps to prevent the migration of rubber constituents into the drug formulation and the absorption of drug constituents into the rubber stopper and results in enhanced shelf life of packaged drugs teflon® is a flourinated ethylenepropylene film applied to the surface of serum stoppers to improve compatibility between the closure and the drug teflon® is a registered trademark of ei dupont de nemours and company b2 coating is a polydimethylsiloxane fluid coating applied to the surface of rubber stoppers and plungers using a patented process b2coating eliminates the need for conventional siliconization to help manufacturers reduce vision system product rejections due to trace levels of silicone molecules found in packaged drug compounds flurotec and b2coating technologies are licensed from daikyo seiko ltd 

in addition to the coating technologies we offer a postmanufacturing process called westar® rs ready to sterilize a documented and fully validated procedure for washing and siliconizing stoppers and syringe components to remove biological materials and endotoxins prior to sterilization the westar® process increases the overall efficiency of injectable drug production by centralizing processing and eliminating steps otherwise required in each of our customers’ manufacturing processes 

our flipoff® secondary closures are tamperevident sterilizable seals consisting of a metal overseal and a molded plastic cap that is removed in order to permit access to the drugvial contents these are sold in a wide range of sizes and color combinations to meet customers’ needs for product identification and differentiation in 2004 we introduced seals with a smoothtop surface for printing or embossing cautionary statements usage or dosage instructions or manufacturer or product names in 2005 we introduced anticounterfeiting technologies that include the use of spectroscopic inks for covert product protection—allowing customers to incorporate price codes or product lot numbers visible only under ultraviolet lights 

the latest seal technology known as west spectra™ rfid currently in development with two manufacturers incorporates a radiofrequency identification chip within the molded cap the chip can include product information and manufacturer information that is readable and easy to update enabling product tracking throughout the entire supply chain 

many injectable drug products including the majority of recently introduced biotechnology products are produced as freezedried powders in order to preserve product efficacy during shipment and storage these products must be reconstituted typically by diluting the powder with sterile water or other diluent at the point of use our acquisition of medimop expanded our product offerings in this area all medimop products are 510kapproved by the united states food and drug administration fda in addition many medimop products are protected by patents 

as an adjunct to our pharmaceutical systems products we offer contract analytical laboratory services for testing and evaluating primary drug packaging components and their compatibility with the contained drug formulation specializing in extractables and leachables testing monarch laboratories specializes in plastic and glass materials testing prior to acquiring monarch our analytical laboratories focused primarily on elastomer materials the two operations have been combined to form west monarch analytical laboratories the integrated laboratories provide us and our customers with indepth knowledge and analysis of the interaction and compatibility of drug products with elastomer glass and plastic packaging components our analytical laboratories also provide specialized testing for complete drug delivery systems 

tech group segment 

our tech group segment serves the medical pharmaceutical diagnostic and healthcare markets with custom contractmanufacturing services products and projects include design and manufacturing of unique components for surgical ophthalmic diagnostic and drug delivery systems such as contact lens storage kits pill dispensers safety needle syringes disposable blood collection systems and components and systems associated with drug inhalation devices this segment has manufacturing operations in the us mexico puerto rico and ireland see item 2 properties  for additional information on our manufacturing sites

the tech group segment also has expertise in product design including inhouse mold design and construction a quickresponse center for developmental and prototype tooling and highspeed automated assemblies technologies include multimaterial molding inmold labeling ultrasonicwelding and automated multicomponent cleanroom assembly 

in january 2006 the fda and the european medicines agency granted marketing approval for exubera® inhalation powder a pulmonary insulin product licensed by pfizer inc and developed by our customer nektar therapeutics we are one of two contractmanufacturers and the only usbased contractmanufacturer for nektar’s inhalation delivery device although the product faces significant challenges in gaining acceptance among physicians and diabetic patients current expectations for the product are positive pfizer currently markets the product in the united kingdom ireland and germany in the us pfizer has initiated plans for an expanded rollout of exubera® to primary care physicians beginning in 2007 

in the consumer products and personal care markets tech group products include the following 

·   childresistant and tamperevident closures and dispensers for personal care products

·   spoutpak ® components used to seal beverage containers spoutpak® is a registered trademark of international paper

·   multipiece components for consumer technology products

·   unique pens and marking systems

·   smallscale fanmotor assemblies

·   laundry and homecare system components

international 

we have significant operations outside the united states they are managed through the same business segments as our us operations—pharmaceutical systems and tech group sales outside of the us account for approximately 49 of consolidated net sales 

for a geographic breakdown of sales see the table in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements segment information  and note 13 affiliated companies  

although the general business process is similar to the domestic business international operations are exposed to additional risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries these risks include currency fluctuations multiple tax jurisdictions and—particularly in latin and south america and the middle east—political and social issues that could destabilize local markets and affect the demand for our products 

depending on the direction of change relative to the us dollar foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations see the discussion under 

the caption summary of significant accounting policies  foreign currency translation in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements also see note 5 other expense  

we attempt to minimize some of our exposure to these exchange rate fluctuations through the use of forward exchange contracts and foreign currency denominated debt this activity is generally discussed in note 1 under the caption summary of significant accounting policies—financial instruments and in note 16 financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements in this 2006 form 10k 

raw materials 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers aluminum and plastic elastomers include both natural and synthetic materials we have access to adequate supplies of these raw materials to meet our production needs through agreements with suppliers and therefore foresee no significant availability problems in the near future 

we utilize a supplychain management strategy in our reporting segments which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply this strategy has reduced the number of our raw material suppliers in most cases we purchase raw materials from a single source to assure quality and reduce costs due to regulatory control over our production processes and the cost and time involved in qualifying suppliers we rely on singlesource suppliers for many critical raw materials this strategy increases the risk that our supply lines may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production problem 

these risks are managed where possible by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites rigid quality control systems surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in case of interruption in production 

intellectual property rights 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business we own or license numerous patents and have patent applications pending in the united states and in foreign countries that relate to various aspects of our products in addition key valuedadded and proprietary products and processes are licensed from our japanese affiliate daikyo seiko ltd our patents and other proprietary rights have been useful in establishing our market share and in the growth of our business and are expected to continue to be of value in the future as we continue to develop proprietary products although of importance in the aggregate we do not consider our business to be materially dependent on any individual patent 

we also rely heavily on trade secrets manufacturing knowhow and continuing technological innovations as well as inlicensing opportunities to maintain and further develop our competitive position particularly in the area of formulation development and tooling design 

if the use of our technologies conflicts with the intellectual property rights of thirdparties we may incur substantial liabilities and we may be unable to commercialize products based on these technologies in a profitable manner if at all 

seasonality 

although our pharmaceutical systems business is not inherently seasonal sales and operating profit in the second half of the year are typically lower when compared to those of the first half of the year primarily due to scheduled plant shutdowns for maintenance procedures and vacations for production employees and the yearend impact of holidays on production scheduling 

working capital 

we are required to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet customer requirements other agreements also require us to purchase inventory in bulk orders which increases inventory levels but 

decreases the risk of supply interruption levels of inventory are also influenced by the seasonal patterns discussed above for a more detailed discussion of working capital please see the discussion in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resource s 

marketing 

our pharmaceutical systems customers include practically every major branded pharmaceutical generic and biopharmaceutical company in the world pharmaceutical systems components and other products are sold to major pharmaceutical biotechnology and hospital supplymedical device companies which incorporate them into their products for distribution to the ultimate enduser 

with extensive experience in contractmanufacturing our tech group segment sells to many of the world’s largest medical device and pharmaceutical companies and to large customers in the personal care and foodandbeverage industries tech group components generally are incorporated into our customers’ manufacturing lines for further processing or assembly

west’s products and services are distributed primarily through our own sales force and distribution network with limited use of contract sales agents and regional distributors 

our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 364 of our consolidated net sales in 2006 but not one of these customers accounted for more than 10 the three largest customers in the tech group segment accounted for approximately 243 of the 2006 net sales for that segment 

order backlog 

at december 31 2006 our order backlog was 2501 million of which 2482 million is expected to be filled during fiscal year 2007 the order backlog was 1825 million at the end of 2005 this increase was primarily due to strengthening demand for key products and blanket orders placed by certain customers for the full year order backlog includes firm orders placed by customers for manufacture over a period of time according to their schedule or upon confirmation by the customer we also have contractual arrangements with a number of our customers and products covered by these contracts are included in our backlog only as orders are received 

competition 

we compete with several companies across our major and minor pharmaceutical systems product lines however we believe that we supply a major portion of the us market for pharmaceutical elastomer and metal packaging components and have a significant share of the european market for these components 

because of the special nature of our pharmaceutical packaging components and our longstanding participation in the market competition is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive costcontrol programs across their entire operations we differentiate ourselves from our competition as a “fullservice valueadded” global supplier that can provide presale formula and engineering development analytical services regulatory expertise and postmanufacturing technologies as well as aftersale technical support customers also appreciate the global scope of west’s manufacturing capability and our ability to produce many products at multiple sites 

our tech group business is in very competitive markets for both healthcare and consumer products the competition varies from smaller regional companies to large global molders that command significant market shares there are extreme cost pressures and many of our customers look offshore to reduce cost we differentiate ourselves by leveraging our global capability and by employing new technologies such as 

highspeed automated assembly insert molding multishot molding and expertise with multiplepiece closure systems because of the more demanding regulatory requirements in the medicaldevice component area there are a smaller number of other competitors mostly largescale companies we compete for this market on the basis of our reputation for quality and reliability in engineering and project management diverse contractmanufacturing capabilities and knowledge of and experience in complying with fda requirements 

research and development activities 

we maintain our own researchscale production facilities and laboratories for development of new products and offer contract engineering design and development services to assist customers with new product development 

our quality control regulatory and laboratory testing capabilities also are used to ensure compliance with applicable manufacturing and regulatory standards for primary and secondary pharmaceutical packaging components our engineering departments are responsible for product and tooling design and testing and for the design and construction of processing equipment in addition we have created an innovation group responsible for seeking new opportunities in injectable packaging and delivery systems for developing innovative new products to serve unmet market needs and for the process of transitioning our tech group segment from primarily a contract manufacturer to a producer of highvalue proprietary systems and products 

in 2006 we employed 69 professionals in these activities we spent 88 million in 2006 63 million in 2005 and 52 million in 2004 on development and engineering for the pharmaceutical systems segment the tech group segment incurred research and development expenses of 23 million 16 million and 16 million in the years 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

commercial development of our new products and services for medical and pharmaceutical applications commonly requires several years new products that we develop may require separate approval as medical devices and products that are intended to be used in packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical products will be subject to both customer acceptance of our products and regulatory approval of the customer’s products following our development period 

employees 

as of december 31 2006 we employed approximately 6323 people in our operations throughout the world 




 item 1a   risk factors 

our sales and profitability depend to a large extent on the sale of drug products delivered by injection if the products developed by our customers in the future use another delivery system our sales and profitability could suffer 

our business depends to a substantial extent on customers’ continued sales and development of products that are delivered by injection we also rely on our customers who develop products that use other delivery means including oral and transmucosal specifically the exubera® inhalationpowder insulin device however if our customers fail to continue to sell develop and deploy new injectable products or we are unable to develop new products that assist in the delivery of drugs by alternative methods our sales and profitability may suffer 

if we are unable to provide comparative value advantages timely fulfillment of customer orders or resist pricing pressure we will have to reduce our prices which may negatively impact our profit margins 

we compete with several companies across our major product lines because of the special nature of these products competition is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive cost control programs across their entire operations competitors often compete on the basis of price we differentiate ourselves from our competition as a “fullservice valueadded” supplier that is able to provide presale compatibility studies and other services and sophisticated postsale technical support on a global basis however we face continued pricing pressure from our customers and competitors if we are unable to resist or to offset the effects of continued pricing pressure through our valueadded services improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures or if we have to reduce our prices our sales and profitability may suffer 

if we are unable to expand our production capacity at our european and asian facilities there may be a delay in fulfilling or we may be unable to fulfill customer orders and this could potentially reduce our sales and our profitability may suffer 

we have significant indebtedness and debt service payments which could negatively impact our liquidity 

we owe substantial debts and have to commit significant cash flow to debt service requirements the level of our indebtedness among other things could 

·   make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements or other purposes

·   limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and

·   make our financial results and share value more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business

our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to reduce our total indebtedness depends on the results of our product development efforts our future operating performance our ability to generate cash flow from the sale of our products and on general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors affecting our operations many of these factors are beyond our control and our future operating performance could be adversely affected by some or all of these factors 

if we incur new indebtedness in the future the related risks that we now face could intensify whether we are able to make required payments on our outstanding indebtedness and to satisfy any other future debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance and our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing 

we are subject to regulation by governments around the world and if these regulations are not complied with existing and future operations may be curtailed and we could be subject to liability 

the design development manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our products and our customers’ products that incorporate our products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the united states europe and other countries including the fda and the european medicines agency the regulatory process can result in required modification or withdrawal of existing products and a substantial delay in the introduction of new products also it is possible that regulatory approval may not be obtained for a new product in addition our analytical laboratories perform certain contract services for drug manufacturers and are subject to the fda’s current good manufacturing practices regulations we must also register as a contract laboratory with the fda and are subject to periodic inspections by the fda the drug enforcement administration has licensed our contract analytical laboratories to handle and store controlled substances 

failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in actions that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our business may be adversely affected by changes in the regulation of drug products and devices 

an effect of the governmental regulation of our customers’ drug products devices and manufacturing processes is that compliance with regulations makes it costly and time consuming for customers to substitute or replace components and devices produced by one supplier with those from another in general terms regulation of our customers’ products that incorporate our components and devices has increased over time however if the applicable regulations were to be modified in a way that reduced the cost and time involved for customers to substitute one supplier’s components or devices for those made by another it is likely that the competitive pressure on us would increase and adversely affect our sales and profitability 

our business may be adversely affected by risks typically encountered in international operations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

we conduct business in most of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world sales outside the us account for approximately 49 of consolidated net sales although the general business process is similar to the domestic business international operations are exposed to additional risks including the following fluctuations in currency exchange rates transportation delays and interruptions political and economic instability and disruptions especially in latin and south america asia and israel the imposition of duties and tariffs import and export controls the risks of divergent business expectations or cultural incompatibility inherent in establishing and maintaining operations in foreign countries difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations labor strikes andor disputes limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies and potentially adverse tax consequences 

any of these events could have an adverse effect on our international operations in the future by reducing the demand for our products decreasing the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we may not be able to operate in compliance with foreign laws and regulations or comply with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject in the event that these laws or regulations change 

raw material and energy prices have a significant impact on our profitability if raw material andor energy prices increase and we cannot pass those price increases on to our customers our profitability and financial condition may suffer 

we use three basic categories of raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers which include synthetic and natural material aluminum and plastic in addition our manufacturing facilities consume a wide variety of energy products to fuel heat and cool our operations supply and demand factors which are beyond our control generally affect the price of our raw materials and utility costs if we are unable to pass along increased raw material prices and energy costs to our customers our profitability and thus our financial condition may be adversely affected the prices of many of these raw materials and utilities are cyclical and volatile for example the prices of certain commodities particularly petroleumbased raw materials have rapidly increased in the recent past increasing the cost of synthetic elastomers and plastic while we generally attempt to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of sales price increases historically there has been a time delay between raw material andor energy price increases and our ability to increase the prices of our products in some circumstances we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pressure and other factors  

disruptions in the supply of key raw materials and difficulties in the supplier qualification process could adversely impact our operations 

we utilize a supply chain management strategy in our reporting segments which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply this strategy has reduced the number of raw material suppliers used by us in most cases we purchase raw materials from a single source to assure quality and reduce costs due to regulatory control over our production processes and the cost and time involved in qualifying suppliers we rely on single source suppliers for many critical raw materials this strategy increases the risks that our supply lines may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production problem these risks are managed where possible by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites rigid quality control systems surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in the case of interruption in production 

however should one of our suppliers be unable to supply materials needed for our products or should our strategies for managing these risks be unsuccessful we may be unable to complete the process of qualifying new replacement materials for some programs in time to meet future production needs 

prolonged disruptions in the supply of any of our key raw materials difficulty completing qualification of new sources of supply or in implementing the use of replacement materials or new sources of supply could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition or cash flows 

our operations must comply with environmental statutes and regulations and any failure to comply could result in extensive costs which would harm our business 

the manufacture of some of our products involves the use transportation storage and disposal of hazardous or toxic materials and is subject to various environmental protection and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate this has exposed us in the past and could expose us in the future to risks of accidental contamination and events of noncompliance with environmental laws any such occurrences could result in regulatory enforcement or personal injury and property damage claims or could lead to a shutdown of some of our operations which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations we currently incur costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations and these costs may become more significant 

a loss of key personnel or highly skilled employees could disrupt our operations 

our executive officers are critical to the management and direction of our businesses our future success depends in large part on our ability to retain these officers and other capable management personnel with the exception of our chief executive officer in general we do not enter into employment agreements with our executive officers we have entered into severance agreements with several of our officers that allow those officers to terminate their employment under particular circumstances such as a change of control affecting our company although we believe that we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise our inability to do so could disrupt the operations of the unit affected or our overall operations in addition because of the complex nature of many of our products and programs we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled engineering staff and workforce our operations could be disrupted by a shortage of available skilled employees

 item 3   legal proceedings 

on february 2 2006 we settled a lawsuit filed in connection with the january 2003 explosion and related fire at our kinston nc plant our monetary contribution was limited to the balance of our deductibles under applicable insurance policies all of which has been previously recorded in our financial statements we continue to be a party but not a defendant in a lawsuit brought by injured workers against a number of thirdparty suppliers to the kinston plant we believe exposure in that case is limited to amounts we and our workers’ compensation insurance carrier would otherwise be entitled to receive by way of subrogation from the plaintiffs 

we and several other potentially interested parties entered into a settlement agreement effective november 10 2006 with the commonwealth of puerto rico relating to damages to natural resources resulting from alleged releases of hazardous substances at an industrial park in vega alta puerto rico the agreement provides for a release of claims by the commonwealth in exchange for a cash settlement payment as part of the settlement we agreed to pay 045 million

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 

company overview 

we are a global pharmaceutical technology company that applies proprietary materials science formulation research and manufacturing innovation to the quality therapeutic value development speed and rapid market availability of pharmaceuticals biologics vaccines and consumer products we have manufacturing locations in north and south america europe and asia pacific with affiliates in mexico and japan our business is conducted through two segments “pharmaceutical systems” and “tech group” our pharmaceutical systems segment focuses on primary packaging components and systems for injectable drug delivery including stoppers and seals for vials and closures and disposable components used in syringe intravenous and blood collection systems the tech group operating segment offers custom contractmanufacturing solutions utilizing plastic injection molding processes targeted to healthcare and consumer industries our global customer base includes the world’s leading manufacturers of pharmaceuticals biologics and medical devices 

in recent years our pharmaceutical systems business has experienced an increased demand for its product offerings we believe this demand is due to a combination of factors including an aging population that is expected to consume more healthcare products and services the increased occurrence and treatment of chronic disorders including diabetes and increased spending on healthcare in the world’s developing economies additional demand for our products has been generated by the approval of new biotechnology drug products delivered by injection or iv infusion frequently as a lyophilized freezedried powder that requires reconstitution at the point of use 

our tech group segment benefits from some of the same factors that impact our pharmaceutical systems segment particularly for products such as insulin pens and iv filters the tech group is one of two contract manufacturers for an inhalation delivery device used in connection with exubera® inhalation powder a pulmonary insulin product developed by our customer nektar therapeutics that is marketed by pfizer inc pfizer currently markets the product in the united kingdom ireland and germany and plans an expanded rollout of exubera® to primary care physicians in the united states in 2007 

we have met our increased demand requirements principally by pursuing manufacturing programs focused on increasing our production capacity at all existing operations adding additional shifts to our production schedule and requiring employees to work overtime many of our european operations are working at or near 100 of current capacity due to the factors cited above management expects that demand will continue to increase in all our geographic regions particularly in asia as the developing economies of china and india create additional markets for our products 

in view of projected sales growth and favorable market trends we expect to accelerate the expansion of our production capacity in the next several years estimating 2007 capital spending to be approximately 130 million with more than 80 of the spending in support of our pharmaceutical systems business we intend to expand molding production and tooling capacity at existing facilities in germany france singapore serbia and the united kingdom we also intend to establish a manufacturing presence in the peoples republic of china resulting in a new plastic injectionmolding plant with planned completion in 2009 and we have initiated agreements to form a joint venture with a local medical rubber manufacturer designed to lead to a new rubber components plant that we expect to be completed in 2011 subject to the transfer of manufacturing licenses and necessary government and regulatory approval approximately 20 of our 2007 capital spending is targeted for the tech group segment including a significant plant relocation that we believe should result in additional medical device production capacity 

our principal source of shortterm liquidity is a 2000 million committed revolving credit facility expiring in 2011 borrowings under the revolving credit agreement were 529 million and outstanding letters of credit were 56 million at december 31 2006 leaving 1415 million available for future use under the facility our revolving credit agreement also contains an uncommitted 500 million “accordion” feature which allows the revolving credit facility to be temporarily expanded to 2500 million we believe that cash flow generated by operations together with our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our capital spending and development programs however management continues to evaluate other financing alternatives which could be more cost efficient or provide greater flexibility for general corporate uses including strategic acquisitions complementary to our core businesses 

our key financial performance indicators include sales and operating income growth earnings per share corporate cash flow operating cash flow less capital expenditures and dividends paid and return on invested capital sales for 2006 were 305 above 2005 levels with the timing impact of our acquisitions and foreign exchange translation contributing 134 and 06 percentage points of the increase respectively operating profit in 2006 was 375 higher than in 2005 earnings from continuing operations in 2006 were 183 per diluted share compared to 141 per diluted share in 2005 our results for 2006 include a pretax loss on extinguishment of debt of 59 million 41 million net of tax or 012 per diluted share and a gain on a tax refund issue of 06 million or 002 per diluted share corporate cash flow in 2006 was 332 million an increase of 158 million over that achieved during 2005 despite higher capital expenditures related to our europeasia plant expansions and the relocation of one of our tech group facilities return on invested capital for 2006 was 112 west’s nonfinancial performance indicators including ontime delivery product discrepancy resolution and compliance tests also generally indicated high levels of performance although ontime delivery metrics have declined as a result of capacity issues 

results of operations 

management’s discussion and analysis of our operating results for the three years ended december 31 2006 and our financial position as of december 31 2006 should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report the operating results of our former clinical service unit and drug delivery research business are reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented our financial statements include the results of acquired businesses for periods subsequent to their acquisition date for the purpose of aiding the comparison of our yeartoyear results reference is made in management’s discussion and analysis to results excluding the timing impact of acquisitions and the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates those remeasured period results are not in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and are “nongaap financial measures” the nongaap financial measures are intended to explain or aid in the use of not as a substitute for the related gaap financial measures 

net sales 

the following table summarizes net sales by reportable segment and product group 

 

  

2006 compared to 2005 

consolidated 2006 net sales were 9133 million an increase of 305 over sales reported in 2005 net sales for 2006 include a full twelve months of results from the businesses acquired during 2005 the acquired businesses consisting of tgi medimop and monarch are included in 2005 results for periods subsequent to their acquisition date the timing impact of our acquisitions accounts for 134 percentage points of the 2006 sales increase favorable foreign currency translation contributed 06 percentage points of the 2006 sales increase excluding the timing impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation 2006 net sales increased 165 over 2005 sales 

in the pharmaceutical systems segment 2006 net sales of 6441 million were 1058 million 197 above 2005 levels the timing impact associated with the 2005 acquisitions of medimop and monarch accounted for 20 percentage points of the 2006 increase foreign currency translation accounted for another 06 percentage points of the 2006 sales increase excluding the timing impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation 2006 net sales in the pharmaceutical systems segment were 171 above those achieved in 2005 sales growth was achieved in both domestic and international markets with sales increases of 177 in the united states and 168 in international markets 

2006 sales of pharmaceutical packaging components were 947 million above those recorded in 2005 accounting for 90 of the 2006 sales growth in the pharmaceutical systems segment sales of stoppers molded from elastomeric formulations and used in the packaging of serum vials lyophilized products and fitments for intravenous systems accounted for almost 40 of the sales increase in pharmaceutical packaging components we continue to experience strong demand for our westar® processed components westar ® is our process for preparing components for direct entry in customers’ sterilization units which helps to increase the efficiency of customer manufacturing operations sales of specially coated stoppers including flurotec®films and teflon® barriers represented approximately half of the overall increase in stopper sales with a portion of that demand representing the return to normal customer ordering patterns and inventory levels following formulation changes that reduced 2005 sales levels 

net sales of prefilled syringe components such as plungers needleshields and tipcaps accounted for approximately 25 of the sales increase in pharmaceutical packaging components with particularly strong demand in international markets resulting from injectable treatments for diabetes anemia and thrombosis our drug reconstitution mixing and transfer products featuring needleless devices and packaging systems 

contributed approximately 17 of the 2006 increase in sales of pharmaceutical packaging components largely reflecting a full year’s sales from the medimop business acquired in the third quarter of 2005 2006 net sales of our flipoff® seals a combination plastic button and aluminum shell used in vial packaging contributed 12 of the increase in pharmaceutical packaging components with strong demand in the united states for a customer’s injectable therapy for kidney dialysis patients 

in other pharmaceutical systems product groups 2006 sales of disposable medical components increased 118 million over the prior year largely due to an improved sales mix in nonfilled syringe components which more than offset an overall decrease in unit volumes in this category net sales of personal care products laboratory and other services remained approximately equal to prior year levels 

in our tech group segment 2006 net sales were 1091 million above those reported in the prior year the acquired tgi business accounted for 1040 million of the increase in segment sales of which 835 million is attributed to the timing of the acquisition the remaining 205 million of the acquired business’s sales increase represents volume related gains approximately 80 of which is attributed to net sales of a pulmonary drug delivery device for the inhaleable insulin product exubera ® inhalation powder licensed by pfizer inc and developed by our customer nektar therapeutics other healthcare device revenues resulting from the assembly of insulin pen injection devices and increased sales of consumer products account for the remainder of the acquired business’s volume related gains our previously existing plastic molding operations that represent the balance of the tech group segment recorded a 2006 net sales increase of 51 million over the prior year on higher sales of juice container closures nurser assemblies and containers for pain relief medication contraceptives and weight loss products 

2005 compared to 2004 

our consolidated 2005 net sales increased 292 over sales reported in 2004 sales in the tgi medimop and monarch businesses are included in 2005 results for periods subsequent to their acquisition date and represented 197 percentage points of the 2005 sales increase versus the prior year favorable foreign currency translation contributed 05 percentage points of the 2005 sales increase excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation 2005 net sales increased 90 over 2004 sales 

in the pharmaceutical systems segment 2005 net sales were 573 million or 119 above 2004 levels acquired businesses contributed 77 million of sales to 2005 results 2005 foreign currency translation variances were 28 million favorable to the prior year excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation 2005 net sales in the pharmaceutical systems segment were 468 million or 97 above those achieved in 2004 sales in international markets generated the majority of the sales increase driven by strong demand for pharmaceutical packaging components used in prefilled syringe systems for the delivery of our customers’ insulin products for diabetes cancer treatments vaccines and dental applications 2005 sales growth in the united states was moderated by the impact of planned formulation changes in specialty coated stoppers used in serum and lyophilized pharmaceutical packaging products our customers increased their inventory levels of these products during 2004 in order to ensure adequate supplies for 2005 pending approval of the formulation changes 

in our tech group segment 2005 net sales were 1701 million with the acquired tgi business accounting for 989 million of segment sales consisting of healthcare devices 537 million consumer products 223 million and tooling projects 229 million excluding the results of the acquired business our previously existing plastic molding operations yielded net sales of 712 million and were 47 above 2004 levels increased sales of consumer products led by increased demand for custom plastic parts used in juice containers was partially offset by declines in healthcare device tooling and other revenues related to the 2004 closure of our uk medical device facility 

gross profit 

the following table summarizes gross profit and gross margin by reportable segment 

 

  

2006 compared to 2005 

consolidated gross profit improved to 2618 million in 2006 a 680 million increase over 2005 results the timing of the 2005 acquisitions accounts for 161 million 114 million in the tech group segment of the increase in gross profit as 2006 includes these businesses for the full twelve month period as compared to partial year periods in 2005 increased sales volumes and improvement in the sales product mix in both segments of our business accounted for nearly all of the nonacquisition related increase in consolidated gross profit in the pharmaceutical systems segment our gross margins improved 27 percentage points with a favorable product mix contributing 07 percentage points of that increase higher sales volumes and efficiency improvements accounted for the remaining pharmaceutical systems segment gross margin increase while sales price increases fully offset higher raw material plant overhead and utility costs in the tech group segment gross margins improved to 144 almost one percentage point higher than the prior year an improved product mix reflecting increased sales of healthcare devices which accounted for 56 of tech segment sales in 2006 compared to 45 in 2005 contributed a two percentage point improvement in tech segment gross margin however this was partially offset by higher material utility and labor costs which exceeded related sales price increases 

2005 compared to 2004 

consolidated gross profit improved to 1938 million in 2005 a 367 million increase over 2004 results the acquired businesses contributed 150 million of the increase in gross profit 116 million within the tech group segment the pharmaceutical systems segment accounted for the remaining gross profit increase generated by higher sales volumes in europe and improved operating efficiencies in north america resulting from the resumption of normal molding operations at our rebuilt kinston north carolina facility the impact of the acquired businesses on our consolidated gross margin in 2005 was a reduction of 24 percentage points reflecting the increase in lower margin revenues within the acquired tgi business gross margins in the pharmaceutical systems segment improved by 11 percentage points over the prior year as many of the interim production costs incurred during the 2004 construction and validation of the new facility were not incurred during 2005 overall product mix variances in 2005 were negligible as the decline in higher margin coated product sales within the pharmaceutical systems segment were offset by increased sales of prefilled syringe systems and westar®processed products with similar margins 2005 tech group segment gross margins decreased by one percentage point compared to the prior year mostly reflecting the increased proportion of tooling revenues within the acquired business which carry gross margins averaging less than five percent

consolidated selling general and administrative “sga” expenses in 2006 were 356 million above those recorded in 2005 approximately 86 million of the increase is due to the timing impact of our acquired businesses which are included in 2005 for the periods subsequent to their acquisition and for a full twelve month period in 2006 

in the pharmaceutical systems segment 2006 sga expenses were 126 million above the prior year the timing of the 2005 medimop acquisition accounts for 20 million of this increase approximately 33 million of the increase was due to increased staffing and funding for research and innovation projects aimed at discovering new technologies or developing new applications for existing processes such as westar ® daikyo’s resin cz ® and prefilled syringes 2006 compensation costs in europe and asia were 19 million higher than 2005 reflecting a combination of annual salary increases staffing increases in sales and production support functions and higher performance based incentive compensation organization and travel costs primarily related to the establishment of our business in china were 15 million higher in 2006 compared to 2005 foreign currency translation accounted for 10 million of the 2006 sga increase other expenses associated mostly with higher facility costs and social taxes accounted for the remaining 29 million increase in pharmaceutical systems segment sga costs 

2006 tech group segment sga costs were 81 million above the prior year the timing of the 2005 tgi acquisition accounts for 66 million of the increase the initial participation in incentive compensation programs and increased staffing levels in human resource functions quality and internal control positions accounted for the remaining 2006 sga increase 

general corporate sga costs include executive compensation and other costs board of directors compensation legal compliance finance and communication expenses in 2006 these costs were 41 million higher than in 2005 as a result of exceeding 2006 performance targets incentive compensation awards accounted for 25 million of the 2006 increase including a 06 million increase in award programs for plant administration and hourly personnel other general corporate compensation costs increased 09 million due mostly to increased finance and legal staffing and higher salary and fringe benefit costs 2006 professional service costs were 07 million above those recorded in 2005 primarily as a result of higher tax consulting costs connected with prior year tax refund issues 

2006 stock based compensation costs increased by 75 million over those incurred in 2005 primarily due to the increase in west stockprice indexed deferred compensation program costs for our board of directors and a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for executive management as of december 31 2006 these deferred compensation plans held 286982 stock equivalent units our stock price at december 31 2006 was 5123 per share compared to 2503 per share at december 31 2005 the resulting change in the fair value of our stock equivalent unit liabilities accounts for nearly all of the 75 million increase in our stock based compensation expense costs of other stock based compensation programs including stock options performance vesting share rights and employee stock purchase programs remained approximately even with prior year levels as moderately higher stock option compensation was offset by lower costs associated with the employee stock purchase program 

2006 us pension plan costs were 84 million exceeding 2005 costs by 33 million the increase in us pension costs is primarily due to changes in actuarial mortality assumptions on october 17 2006 our board of directors approved an amendment to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in the united states under the amended plan benefits earned under the plan’s pension formulas for both hourly and salaried participants were frozen as of december 31 2006 effective january 1 2007 new cashbalance formulas will be implemented for covered hourly and salaried participants and new hires pursuant to which a percentage of a participant’s compensation will be credited to a participant account each year including the impact of these changes we estimate 2007 us pension plan expense will be approximately 64 million we expect the decrease in pension costs to be largely offset by increased costs for our 401k savings plan covering certain salaried and hourly us employees which was also amended effective january 1 2007 resulting in a change in employer contributions to a 100 match on the first 3 of employee contributions and a 50 match on the next 2 of employee contributions in 2006 the company match was equal to 50 of each participant’s contribution up to 6 of the participant’s base compensation 

2005 compared to 2004 

2005 consolidated selling general and administrative expenses were 151 million above those reported in 2004 sga costs within the acquired business units accounted for 98 million of the increase 18 million in the pharmaceutical systems segment and 80 million in the tech group segment other 2005 increases in pharmaceutical systems segment costs over 2004 are attributed to higher compensation costs of 42 million associated with annual salary increases and sales incentive programs increased consulting costs of 15 million for information systems projects ‘lean’ manufacturing programs and marketing studies and unfavorable foreign exchange variances of 05 million excluding the impact of the tgi acquisition other tech group segment sga costs decreased by 02 million due to lower consulting costs within our previously existing plastic molding operations 

general corporate costs decreased by 04 million in 2005 from 2004 levels primarily as a result of a decrease in legal fees connected with the 2003 kinston explosion and related fire 

stock based compensation costs in 2005 were 04 million lower than in 2004 the january 1 2005 adoption of statement of financial accounting standard 123 “sharebased payment—revised 2004” “sfas 123r” resulted in the recognition of 27 million of sga expense connected with our stock option and employee stock purchase plan programs which did not require expense recognition in 2004 under previous accounting standards the adoption impact of sfas 123 r was more than offset by a 17 million decrease in directors and executive deferred compensation plan expense and a 14 million decrease in costs associated with performance vesting share “pvs” rights to senior management as previously noted the value of our deferred compensation plans is indexed to the company’s stock price the increase in our stock price during 2004 resulted in 17 million of stock appreciation and compensation expense on these plans our stock price remained constant during 2005 beginning and ending the year at 2503 per share resulting in no stockprice based appreciation expense in 2005 the 

decrease in pvs costs is principally connected with the initial 2004 performance award which vested entirely upon 2004 results rather than the two and three year performance periods associated with subsequent awards 

2005 us pension plan expenses were approximately even with 2004 levels 

restructuring charge benefit 

in 2005 we reached final settlement of all remaining lease obligations connected with the closure of a plastic device manufacturing plant in the united kingdom resulting in the reduction of previously estimated cost accruals of 13 million in 2004 we ceased all production activities at the uk operation and recorded a 10 million restructuring charge for the excess of future lease costs over expected sublease rental income as well as additional severance expense and repair costs necessary to return the leased facility to its original condition the initial decision to close the uk plant was made in 2003 resulting in a 7 million charge which included assetretirement obligations impairment charges and provisions for statutory postemployment benefit costs 

other expense 

other expense consists of gains and losses on the sale or disposal of equipment and other assets foreign exchange transaction items miscellaneous royalty and sundry transactions 

 

  

2006 other expenses were 35 million above those recorded in 2005 our pharmaceutical systems segment recorded a 25 million charge connected with the impairment of assets involved in the production and licensing of one of our reconstitution products following a substantial reduction in projected orders causing a decline in our fair value estimates for this product line the impairment charge includes a 16 million reduction to the value of the dedicated production assets for this product a 05 million minimum royalty payment called for under our licensing agreement and a 04 million decrease in the value of our licensing rights the remaining 2006 versus 2005 other expense increase principally relates to the sale or disposal of surplus equipment 

operating profit 

operating profit loss by reportable segment corporate and other unallocated costs were as follows 

 

  

our 2006 operating profit increased by 276 million or 375 over that achieved in 2005 the timing impact of our 2005 acquisitions accounts for 71 million of the 2006 operating profit increase 24 million in the pharmaceutical systems segment and 47 million in the tech group segment the remaining increase in operating profit was generated by sales growth and gross margin improvements in both of our business segments partially offset by higher costs associated with deferred compensation obligations indexed to our stock price 

the businesses acquired during 2005 contributed 52 million pharmaceutical systems 17 million and tech group 35 million of the 240 million consolidated operating profit increase over 2004 the remaining 2005 to 2004 operating profit improvement in the pharmaceutical systems segment was principally the result of increased sales volumes in europe and lower production costs in the united states following the resumption of normal production activities at our kinston facility in addition to the impact of the acquired business 2005 tech group segment operating profit also benefited from cost savings following the closure of the former uk facility 

loss on debt extinguishment 

on february 27 2006 we prepaid 100 million in senior notes carrying a 681 interest rate and a maturity date of april 8 2009 under the terms of the original note purchase agreement dated april 8 1999 the prepayment of the notes entitled note holders to a “make whole” amount of 59 million in order to compensate them for interest rate differentials between the 681 yield on the notes and current market rates for the remaining term of the note 

the prepayment was financed by issuing € 815 million approximately 100 million of new senior unsecured notes having a weighted average maturity of just over nine years at a weighted average interest rate of 434 before costs the lowerinterest notes are expected to reduce annual pretax financing costs by approximately 25 million

interest expense net 

the following table summarizes our net interest expense for the threeyear period ended december 31 2006 

 

  

our 2006 net interest expense decreased 14 million from 2005 levels the 2006 refinancing of our 100 million senior notes resulted in interest savings of 21 million these savings were partially offset by unfavorable interest rate variances on our revolving debt of 02 million and 05 million resulting from higher average borrowing levels associated with the financing and timing of our 2005 business acquisitions 2006 interest income includes 03 million of interest paid to us in connection with the settlement of tax refund issues 

2005 net interest expense increased 50 million over the prior year higher average borrowing levels resulting from our 2005 acquisition activity accounted for 40 million of the interest expense increase the remaining 10 million increase in 2005 interest expense was caused by higher interest rates on variable rate borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate on consolidated income from continuing operations was 291 in 2006 290 in 2005 and 272 in 2004 income tax expense in 2006 includes a net 07 million favorable adjustment primarily resulting from the closure of the 2002 us federal tax audit year and a 04 million tax benefit resulting from a tax refund associated with the disposition of our former plastic molding facility in puerto rico the combined impact of these two items reduced our 2006 effective tax rate by 14 percentage points 

in 2005 we repatriated 1660 million in earnings from foreign subsidiaries to the united states parent companies the foreign repatriations were made in accordance with the provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 “ajca” the ajca provided a temporary incentive for us multinational companies to repatriate accumulated income earned in controlled foreign corporations by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction on qualified distributions occurring before december 31 2005 our 2005 results include a 15 million net tax charge 52 million gross tax cost less 24 million of foreign tax credits and 13 million in previously established accruals for unremitted earnings incurred in connection with the repatriation program which increased our overall 2005 effective tax rate by 25 percentage points the 2005 restructuring credit in the uk allowed us to utilize prior year loss carryforwards and therefore decreased our 2005 effective tax rate by 06 percentage points in addition we reduced tax contingencies connected with the closure of tax years in certain international locations resulting in a 28 percentage point reduction in the 2005 effective tax rate 

the 2004 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the utilization of foreign tax credits on the filing of a prior year us tax return a change in french tax law extending the life of net operating loss carryforwards and the reversal of reserves attributable to the closing of tax years the combined impact of these items offset partially by the nondeductible restructuring charge resulted in a 43 percentage point reduction in the 2004 effective tax rate 

equity in affiliates 

the contribution to earnings from our 25 ownership interest in daikyo seiko ltd in japan and 49 ownership interest in three companies in mexico was income of 19 million 24 million and 34 million for the years 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively our 2006 equity income from daikyo was 01 million below that recorded in 2005 daikyo’s 2006 sales and operating growth were approximately 8 above those achieved in 2005 however the increase in the us dollar relative to the japanese yen fully offset the operational gains daikyo’s 2006 results include a 07 million loss related to a decision by daikyo to demolish an existing facility in order to proceed with the construction of a new plant the charge was largely offset by an unrelated gain on an investment security our 2006 equity income from our mexican affiliates declined 04 million from 2005 levels following the transfer of some customer products to our fullyowned plant in kinston north carolina 

our 2005 equity income was 10 million lower than that achieved in 2004 primarily due to the impact on daikyo’s results of customer purchases during 2004 of a product in advance of a pending fda approval of a required product reformulation the increased customer inventory levels accumulated during 2004 resulted in lower sales levels for daikyo in 2005 as customers utilized existing inventory pending validation of the new formulation the 2005 operating results of the mexican affiliates improved on strong sales growth generating results equal to those recorded in 2004 which included a nonoperating 06 million gain on the sale of real estate 

our purchases from all affiliates totaled approximately 241 million in 2006 206 million in 2005 and 286 million in 2004 the majority of which relates to our distributorship agreement with daikyo which allows us to purchase and resell daikyo products sales to affiliates were 08 million 05 million and 06 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

income from continuing operations 

2006 net income from continuing operations was 615 million or 183 per diluted share our 2006 results include a pretax 59 million loss on debt extinguishment 41 million net of tax or 012 per diluted share and the favorable resolution of a claim for a tax refund associated with the disposition of our former plastic molding facility in puerto rico resulting in the recognition in income from continuing operations of 06 million or 002 per diluted share consisting of a 04 million tax benefit and related interest income net of tax of 02 million 

our 2005 net income from continuing operations was 460 million or 141 per diluted share these results included incremental income tax expense of 15 million or 005 per diluted share associated with the repatriation of foreign sourced income under the american jobs creation act of 2004 results for 2005 also include a restructuring credit which increased net income from continuing operations by 13 million or 04 per diluted share 

net income from continuing operations in 2004 was 343 million or 111 per diluted share results for 2004 include incremental manufacturing costs of 116 million 79 million net of tax or 026 per diluted share associated with the interim production processes that were put in place following a 2003 explosion and fire at our kinston nc plant 2004 results also include kinstonrelated legal expenses of 17 million 12 million net of tax or 004 per diluted share the closure of a manufacturing plant in the uk resulted in 2004 restructuring charges of 10 million 003 per diluted share equity income included a 06 million 002 per diluted share real estate gain 2004 results also include 21 million 007 per diluted share of favorable tax adjustments resulting from utilization of foreign tax credits on the filing of a prior year tax return and a change in french tax legislation prior to the adoption of sfas 123r on january 1 2005 we had accounted for stock compensation using the intrinsic value method had the fair value method prescribed by sfas 123r been applied to earlier periods our results would have included additional pretax stock compensation costs for stock options and the employee stock purchase plan of 18 million 12 million net of tax or 04 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2004

discontinued operations 

our 2006 income from discontinued operations was 56 million or 017 per diluted share as a result of a favorable outcome to our claim for tax benefits relating to the 2001 sale of our former contract manufacturing and packaging business we received a tax refund resulting in the recognition of a 40 million tax benefit the settlement of this claim also resulted in pretax interest income of 06 million 04 million after taxes we also recognized a 12 million favorable adjustment to tax accruals associated with our former drug delivery systems segment primarily as a result of the closure of the 2002 us federal tax audit year 

2005 income from discontinued operations was 04 million or 001 per diluted share the majority of the income was generated from the august 2005 sale of the clinical services unit pretax gain of 07 million 05 million net of tax operating losses and other costs associated with the sale of our former drug delivery business completed in the first quarter of 2005 totaled 19 million 11 million net of tax more than offsetting the operating income of 16 million 10 million net of tax generated by the clinical services unit prior to its divestiture 

in december 2004 we entered into an agreement to sell our drug delivery business the sales price consisted of 71 million receivable due in cash at the 2005 closing date and a 14 ownership interest in the new company valued at 10 million as a result of the transaction we recorded a pretax loss of 47 million 52 million aftertax or 017 per diluted share the 05 million net tax expense was primarily the result of the reversal of current and prior year tax benefits that were no longer available as a result of the transaction in december 2004 we also announced our intention to exit the clinical services business 

the operating results of the drug delivery business and clinical service unit are classified within discontinued operations for all periods presented the pretax loss from the discontinued drug delivery and clinical services operations was 135 million for 2004 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows generated from operations totaled 1394 million in 2006 compared to 856 million in 2005 our growth in operating cash flow was led by pharmaceutical systems north american operations which generated strong operating profit growth while reducing working capital levels operating cash flow in pharmaceutical system’s europeasia operating segment and our tech group segment also improved over prior year levels moderated by higher inventory requirements 

consolidated capital spending for 2006 totaled 903 million a 362 million increase over 2005 capital spending 2006 capital spending in our pharmaceutical systems segment accounted for 240 million of the increase with 190 million of the increase occurring in europe and asia in addition to the initial spending on plant expansions throughout europe and asia major projects included new presses used in the production of our trimtec ® closures for iv bottles additional rubber compression molding equipment and increased westar ® capacity in germany a new vision inspection process in france additional equipment for lining materials used in insulin packaging in denmark and the purchase of land for an expanded administration building in germany in the tech group segment 2006 capital spending was 135 million more than in 2005 with the relocation and expansion of a plant in michigan accounting for 75 of the increase 2006 general corporate and other projects declined by 13 million from prior year levels 

2006 and 2005 cash flows provided by investing operations each include a 02 million loan repayment received from our affiliate in mexico in 2005 net cash of 1748 million was used to acquire monarch tgi and medimop cash provided by investing activities in 2004 includes 318 million of insurance proceeds related to the kinston accident which helped to fund the reconstruction of the new facility 

cash flows used in financing activities include the prepayment of 1000 million of 681 senior notes on february 27 2006 we financed the prepayment by issuing € 815 million of new senior unsecured notes with a usd value of approximately 1000 million € 204 million of the notes have a maturity of 7 years with an interest rate of 4215 while the remaining € 611 million of the notes have a maturity of 10 years and an interest rate of 438 our strong operating cash flow in 2006 has allowed us to reduce borrowing under our revolving credit agreements by 577 million from year end 2005 levels

financing cash flows in 2006 include proceeds from stock option exercises and related tax benefits totaling 153 million dividends paid to shareholders were 159 million 049 per share the board of directors intends to continue the practice of declaring dividends following their quarterly review of the west pharmaceutical services inc’s financial condition and results of operations management expects that cash flows from continuing operations net of capital spending requirements will provide sufficient funding for the current dividend policy 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december 31 2006 and the effect the obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 

 

1   future interest payments on variablerate debt were calculated using the applicable ending interest rate at december 31 2006

we have letters of credit totaling 56 million supporting the reimbursement of workers’ compensation and other claims paid on our behalf by insurance carriers and to guarantee equipment lease payments in ireland and the payment of sales tax liabilities in the united states the accrual for insurance obligations was 24 million at december 31 2006

offbalance sheet agreements 

at december 31 2006 the company had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business and outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs and leased equipment and sales tax liability guarantees as noted above 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions some of which are subjective and complex that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements management believes the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating the results of operations and financial position of west pharmaceutical services inc 

revenue recognition   the majority of our revenue is generated from our standard product manufacturing operations which convert rubber metal and plastic raw materials into component parts used in closure systems and syringe components for use with injectable drugs and drug delivery devices sales of manufactured components are recorded at the time title and risk of loss passes to the customer some customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes management records rebate costs based on its assessment of the likelihood that these volumes will be attained we also establish 

product return liabilities for customer quality claims when such amounts are deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated 

approximately 5 of our revenue is generated by the construction of tools molds or automation equipment these projects generally take several months to complete and utilize west’s experienced personnel and wholly owned tool shops we record revenue on a percentage of completion basis utilizing the ratio of actual cost incurred over total costs estimated for each project additionally if at any time during the life of a project it is determined that the estimated project cost will exceed the purchase commitment from the customer the entire amount of the estimated loss is recorded immediately 

impairment of longlived assets   we review goodwill and longlived assets annually and whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment as part of the reporting unit to which it belongs our reporting units are the same as our operating segments which we have determined to be the americas and europeasia pacific divisions of the pharmaceutical systems segment and the tech group segment for assets held and used in the business management estimates the future cash flows to be derived from the related asset or business unit when assets are held for sale management determines fair value by estimating the anticipated proceeds to be received upon the sale of the asset less disposition costs changes in the estimate of fair value including the estimate of future cash flows could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position

employee benefits   the measurement of the obligations under our defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plans are subject to a number of assumptions these include the rate of return on plan assets and the rate at which the future obligations are discounted to present value for us plans which account for 90 of global plan assets the longterm rate of return assumption decreased to 80 in 2006 from 875 in 2005 in 2007 the longterm rate of return assumption remains 800 the return assumption is reviewed annually and determined by the projected return for the expected mix of plan assets approximately 65 equity and 35 debt securities the discount rate increased 25 basis points to 59 at december 31 2006 to reflect current market conditions the discount rate selected is the single rate equivalent for a theoretical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that produces a cash flow pattern equivalent to the plans’ projected benefit payments changes in these estimates including the market performance of plan assets and other actuarial assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position every 25 basis point reduction in the longterm rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by approximately 05 million a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately 07 million

as described more fully in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements benefit plans  included within item 8 of this 2006 form 10k we amended the benefit formulas used in our us defined benefit plans resulting in a 188 million reduction in our projected benefit obligations the impact of the plan amendment will be recognized as a reduction to pension expense over a 12 year period representing the estimated average remaining service period of plan participants affected by the amendment 

on december 31 2006 we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans—an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” “sfas 158” the new standard requires the recognition of an asset or liability for the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as measured by the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation for a pension plan the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation for any other postretirement plan such as a retiree health plan the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation the adoption of sfas 158 resulted in a reduction of shareholders’ equity of 197 million 320 million pretax less a 123 million deferred tax benefit at december 31 2006 

income taxes   we estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation in addition deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established to recognize differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities we maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized the recoverability of tax assets is subject to our estimates of future profitability generally at the local subsidiary company and country level changes in tax legislation business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined

in june 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 “accounting for income taxes” fin 48 this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements fin 48 prescribes a morelikelythannot threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods and income tax disclosures fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 the provisions of this interpretation must be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption of fin 48 the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin 48 must be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year management is in the process of determining what impact if any the adoption of fin 48 will have on our financial statements 

inventories   accounting for inventories involves estimates regarding the proper determination of manufacturing cost obsolescence and identifying inventory values that exceed estimated market values the determination of manufacturing cost includes the identification of direct material costs and allocations of direct labor variable production costs and overhead allocations of fixed overhead costs are based on estimates of normal capacity and require judgment when production levels are below normal so that idle capacity costs are expensed in the period incurred the valuation of inventories is also subject to usage or ‘flow’ assumptions

during the first quarter of 2006 we changed our method of inventory costing from lastinfirstout lifo to firstinfirstout fifo for certain inventory located in the united states which accounted for approximately 30 of our total consolidated inventory at december 31 2005 the majority 70 of our inventory had already been accounted for under primarily the fifo method the change was made to facilitate a comparison of our financial results with those of our principal competitors and customers on such measures as inventory levels and turnover gross margin and operating earnings we also believe that using the fifo method provides a better match of expenses and revenues and provides a more consistent inventory costing method within our operating segments thus the change in accounting was considered preferable the impact of the change has been applied retrospectively and the financial statements have been adjusted for all prior periods presented see additional discussion in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financials statements 

please refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 19 new accounting standards  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included within item 8 of this report for additional information on accounting and reporting standards considered in the preparation and presentation of west pharmaceutical services inc’s financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk  

we are exposed to various market risk factors such as fluctuating interest rates and foreign currency rate fluctuations these risk factors can impact results of operations cash flows and financial position from time to time we manage these risks using derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts derivatives used by us are highly effective as all of the critical terms of the 

derivative instruments match the hedged item effectiveness is measured on a quarterly basis in accordance with company policy derivative financial instruments are not used for speculation or trading purposes all debt securities and derivative instruments are considered nontrading 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have subsidiaries outside the us accounting for approximately 49 of consolidated net sales virtually all of these sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into us dollars although the majority of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are in the local currency of the subsidiary and are therefore translated into us dollars the foreign subsidiaries may also hold assets or liabilities not denominated in their local currency these items may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains and losses as a result our results of operations and financial position are exposed to changing exchange rates we periodically use forward contracts to hedge certain transactions or to neutralize monthend balance sheet exposures on crosscurrency intercompany loans 

as of december 31 2006 we have a forwardexchange contract of 065 million ending on january 11 2007 that protects us against the variability in future cash flows related to raw material purchases by european subsidiaries denominated in us dollars usd the terms of the arrangement set a base rate of 122 usd per euro and a limit rate of 135 usd per euro we are protected against a strengthening usd by restricting the exchange rate to the base rate we would participate in gains caused by a weakening usd up to the limit rate if the limit rate is exceeded at the expiration date the company agrees to buy usd at the base rate for that month there are no cash payments required and no income statement effect of an exchange rate between the base and limit rates as of december 31 2006 the euro was equal to 131 usd 

we have designated our € 815 million debt as a hedge of our investment in the net assets of our european operations a 70 million cumulative foreign currency translation loss on the € 815 million debt is recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income as of december 31 2006 we also have a 27 billion yendenominated note payable which has been designated as a hedge of our investment in a japanese affiliate at december 31 2006 a foreign exchange translation gain on the yendenominated debt of less than 01 million is included within accumulated other comprehensive income

interest rate risk 

as a result of our normal borrowing activities we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates which we manage primarily through our financing activities we have longterm debt with both fixed and variable interest rates longterm debt consists of senior notes revolving credit facilities and capital lease obligations portions of longterm debt which are payable during 2007 are classified as shortterm liabilities as of december 31 2006 the following table summarizes our interest rate risksensitive instruments 

 

1   as of december 31 2006 we have two interest rate swap agreements outstanding which are designed to protect against volatility in variable interest rates payable on a 500 million note maturing on july 28 2012 “series a note” and a 250 million note maturing july 28 2015 “series b note” the first interestrate swap agreement has a notional amount of 500 million and corresponds to the maturity date of the series a note and the second interest rate swap agreement has a notional amount of 250 million and corresponds with the maturity date of the series b note under each of the swap agreements we will receive variable interest rate payments based on threemonth libor in return for making quarterly fixed payments including the applicable margin the interestrate swap agreements effectively fix the interest rates payable on series a and b notes payable at 532 and 551 respectively at december 31 2006 the interest rateswap agreements had a fair value of 19 million favorable to the company and are recorded as a noncurrent asset

 item 1   description of business

general 

west pharmaceutical services inc which may be referred to as west  the company  we  us or our  is a manufacturer of components and systems for injectable drug delivery and plastic packaging and delivery system components for the healthcare personal care and consumer products markets our products include stoppers and seals for vials and components used in syringes intravenous delivery systems and blood collection and diagnostic systems our customers include the world’s leading pharmaceutical biotechnology generic drug and medicaldevice producers the company was incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania on july 27 1923 

in recent years we have gone through a series of acquisitions and dispositions designed to focus our business on our core competencies in pharmaceutical packaging delivery components and devices and related services 

on december 24 2004 we agreed to sell our drug delivery systems business for 71 million in cash a right to receive additional payments contingent upon the acquiring entity’s sales of products and an approximately 14 ownership interest in the acquiring entity that business consisted of developing proprietary chemicalbased delivery methods which when combined with the active drug compound would improve the drug’s delivery profile 

we also sold our clinical services business unit in august 2005 for 57 million in cash and a receivable for an additional 05 million for financial reporting purposes the operating results of the drug delivery business and clinical services unit have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

on february 11 2005 we acquired monarch analytical laboratories inc monarch which provides analytical testing services for glass plastics and elastomer packaging for 20 million in cash and 18 million in west common stock additionally the company assumed and subsequently paid debt in the amount of 19 million 

we completed the acquisition of the business assets of the tech group inc tgi on may 20 2005 for 1405 million in cash tgi manufactures plastic components and assemblies for the pharmaceutical medical device consumer products and personal care markets

business segments 

we have two reportable segments pharmaceutical systems and tech group the recently acquired medimop and monarch businesses are reported as part of the pharmaceutical systems segment our tech group segment consists of the acquired businesses of tgi and our previously existing device group operations 

comparative segment revenues and related financial information for 2005 2004 and 2003 are presented in a table contained in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements segment information  and the section headed results of operations in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of this 2005 form 10k 

results of the nowsold drug delivery and clinical services units are contained in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements discontinued operations  included within this 2005 form 10k 

pharmaceutical systems segment 

our pharmaceutical systems segment designs manufactures and distributes a variety of elastomer and metal components used in parenteral drug delivery for the branded pharmaceutical generic and biopharmaceutical industries and is the world’s largest independent manufacturer of pharmaceutical packaging components stoppers plungers and seals the primary components we manufacture are subject to regulatory oversight within our customers’ manufacturing facilities we have manufacturing facilities in north and south america europe and asia with affiliated companies in mexico and japan see item 2 properties  for additional information on our manufacturing sites 

our pharmaceutical systems segment consists of two operating segments—the americas and europeasia—which are aggregated for reporting purposes because they have similar economic characteristics as well as similar products manufacturing processes customer objectives distribution procedures and regulatory requirements the pharmaceutical systems segment includes the results of medimop a company acquired in august 2005 that specializes in reconstitution mixing and transfer technologies for injectable drugs in vials bags ampoules and syringes 

our pharmaceutical systems business is composed of the following product lines 

·   elastomeric stoppers and discs which serve as primary closures for pharmaceutical vials

·   secondary closures for pharmaceutical vials called flipoff® aluminum seals consisting of an aluminum seal and removable plastic button and in some applications just an aluminum seal

·   elastomeric syringe plungers stoppers for blood collection systems and flashback bulbs and sleeve stoppers for intravenous dispensing systems

·   elastomer and comolded elastomerplastic components for infusion iv sets

·   dropper bulbs—including tamperevident droppers—for applications such as eye ear and nasal drops diagnostic products and dispensing systems

·   needle shields and tip caps to fit most standard prefilled syringes and combination seals for dental cartridges and pens

·   baby bottle nipple and pacifier bulbs from a variety of elastomeric formulations

our elastomeric components are offered in a variety of standard and customerspecific configurations and formulations these components are available with advanced coatings and barrier films that enhance their performance these include flurotec® components and products using a teflon® based film and b2 coating teflon® is a registered trademark of ei dupont de nemours and company the flurotec® process involves applying a fluoropolymer film to rubber stoppers and plungers to prevent the migration of rubber constituents into the drug formulation and to prevent the absorption of drug constituents into the rubber stopper resulting in additional protection of the shelf life of packaged drugs our teflon® coated closures have included a flourinated ethylenepropylene film applied to their surface to improve compatibility between the closure and the drug b2 coating technology applies a coating to the surface of rubber stoppers and plungers to improve surface lubricity and reduce friction on the packaging components as they pass through drug manufacturers’ filling lines leading to significant improvements to the manufacturers’ production process without the use of silicon oil silicon oil is commonly used to improve handling of elastomer components but can have negative residual effects on drug products that come into contact with siliconlubricated components 

in addition to the coating technologies we offer a postmanufacturing process called westar® rs ready to sterilize a documented and fully validated procedure for washing and siliconizing stoppers and syringe components to remove biological materials and endotoxins prior to sterilization the westar® process increases the overall efficiency of injectable drug production by centralizing processing and eliminating steps otherwise required in each of our customers’ manufacturing processes westar® ru ready to use currently in development will provide components that are presterilized and ready for direct introduction into our customers’ aseptic filling suites 

our flipoff® secondary closures are tamperevident sterilizable seals consisting of a metal overseal and a molded plastic cap that is removed in order to permit access to the drugvial contents these are sold in a wide range of sizes and color combinations to meet customers’ needs for product identification and differentiation in 2004 we introduced seals with a smoothtop surface for printing or embossing cautionary statements usage or dosage instructions or manufacturer or product names in 2005 we introduced anticounterfeiting technologies that include the use of spectroscopic inks for covert product protection—allowing customers to incorporate price codes or product lot numbers visible only under ultraviolet lights 

the latest seal technology known as west spectra™ currently in development with two manufacturers incorporates a radiofrequency identification chip within the molded cap the chip can include product information and manufacturer information that is readable and easy to update enabling product tracking throughout the entire supply chain 

many injectable drug products including the majority of recently introduced biotechnology products are produced as freezedried powders in order to preserve product efficacy during shipment and storage 

in addition to employing specialized packaging components that we manufacture these products must be reconstituted typically by diluting the powder with sterile water or other diluent at the point of use we began offering a product to aid in reconstitution with our clip’n’ject® product an inlicensed proprietary singleuse drug reconstitution system that is currently in use on a product for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer manufactured and marketed by watson pharmaceuticals inc our acquisition of medimop expanded our product offerings in this area medimop designs develops and manufactures transfer mixing and administration systems for injectable pharmaceuticals all medimop products are 510kapproved by the united states food and drug administration fda in addition many medimop products are protected by patents 

as an adjunct to our pharmaceutical systems products we offer contract analytical laboratory services for testing and evaluating primary drug packaging components and their compatibility with the contained drug formulation specializing in extractables and leachables testing for customers on a contract basis monarch laboratories specializes in plastic and glass materials testing prior to acquiring monarch our analytical laboratories focused primarily on elastomer materials the two operations have been combined to form west monarch analytical laboratories the integrated laboratories provide us and our customers with indepth knowledge and analysis of the interaction and compatibility of drug products with elastomer glass and plastic packaging components our analytical laboratories also provide specialized testing for drug delivery systems and container closure components 

tech group segment 

we created the tech group segment following our acquisition of tgi our tech group segment is composed of our previously existing device group and the tgi businesses through this segment we conduct manufacturing operations in the us mexico puerto rico and ireland our tech group segment offers custom contractmanufacturing services that require precision plastic injectionmolding and assembly this segment also offers expertise in product design including inhouse mold design and construction a quickresponse center for developmental and prototype tooling and highspeed automated assembly solutions technologies employed in the manufacture of many of our tech group products include multimaterial molding inmold labeling spinand ultrasonicwelding and automated multicomponent assembly processes

in the medical pharmaceutical diagnostic and healthcare markets products and projects include design and manufacturing of unique components for surgical ophthalmic diagnostic and drug delivery systems such as contact lens storage kits pill dispensers safety needle syringes disposable blood collection systems and components and systems associated with drug inhalation devices we are one of two contractmanufacturers and the only usbased contractmanufacturer of pulmonary drug delivery devices for the inhalable insulin product exubera® inhalation powder this product which is licensed by pfizer inc and was developed by our customer nektar is expected to be introduced during 2006 

in the consumer products and personal care markets tech group products include the following 

·   childresistant and tamperevident closures and dispensers for personal care products

·   spoutpak ® components used to seal beverage containers spoutpak® is a registered trademark of international paper

·   multipiece components for consumer technology products

·   unique pens and marking systems

·   smallscale fanmotor assemblies

·   laundry and homecare system components

research and development activities 

we maintain our own researchscale production facilities and laboratories for development of new products and offer contract engineering design and development services to assist customers with new product development 

our quality control regulatory and laboratory testing capabilities also are used to ensure compliance with applicable manufacturing and regulatory standards for primary and secondary pharmaceutical packaging components our engineering departments are responsible for product and tooling design and testing and for the design and construction of processing equipment in addition a corporatebased product development department develops new packaging and device concepts 

in 2005 we employed 64 professionals in these activities we spent 63 million in 2005 52 million in 2004 and 46 million in 2003 on development and engineering for the pharmaceutical systems reporting segment the tech group segment incurred research and development expenses of 16 million in 2005 16 million in 2004 and 17 million in 2003 

in 2006 and beyond we plan to significantly increase spending to identify and introduce innovative new products and services these offerings will relate directly to customers and markets we now serve using the combined capabilities and customer access that exist in our divisions partners and recently acquired businesses resources will be focused on intellectual property technology acquisition market research internal and external developmental resources earlystage manufacturing capacity and sales and marketing of these innovative products we expect these investments to begin driving highvalue growth of proprietary products starting in the next three to seven years 

commercial development of our new products and services for medical and pharmaceutical applications commonly requires several years new products that we develop may require separate approval as medical devices and products that are intended to be used in packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical products will be subject to both customer acceptance of our products and regulatory approval of the customer’s products 

international 

we have significant operations outside the united states they are managed through the same business segments as our us operations—pharmaceutical systems and tech group sales outside of the us account for approximately 51 of consolidated net sales 

for a geographic breakdown of sales see the table in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements segment information  and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements affiliated companies  

although the general business process is similar to the domestic business international operations are exposed to additional risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries these risks include currency fluctuations multiple tax jurisdictions and—particularly in latin and south america and the middle east—political and social issues that could destabilize local markets and affect the demand for our products 

depending on the direction of change relative to the us dollar foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations in 2005 sales were favorably impacted by foreign exchange as foreign currency movements relative to the us dollar increased our reported sales in many countries see the discussion under the captions summary of significant accounting policies—foreign currency translation in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements in this 2005 form 10k also see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements other expense income  included within this 2005 form 10k 

we attempt to minimize some of our exposure to these exchange rate fluctuations through the use of forward exchange contracts this activity is generally discussed in note 1 under the captions summary of significant accounting policies—financial instruments and in note 17 financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements in this 2005 form 10k 

marketing 

our pharmaceutical systems customers include practically every major branded pharmaceutical generic and biopharmaceutical company in the world pharmaceutical systems components and other products are sold to major pharmaceutical biotechnology and hospital supplymedical device companies which incorporate them into their products for distribution to the ultimate enduser 

with extensive experience in contractmanufacturing our tech group segment partners with many of the largest medical device and pharmaceutical companies worldwide as well as with large customers in the personal care and foodandbeverage industries tech group components generally are incorporated into our customers’ manufacturing lines for further processing or assembly

our products and services are distributed primarily through our own sales force and distribution network with limited use of contract sales agents and regional distributors 

becton dickinson and company bd is our largest customer accounting for approximately 11 of our 2005 consolidated net sales excluding bd the next ten largest customers accounted for approximately 31 of our consolidated net sales in 2005 but not one of these customers accounted for more than 5 of 2005 consolidated net sales the three largest customers in the tech group segment accounted for approximately 21 of the 2005 net sales for that segment 

intellectual property rights 

patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business we own or license numerous patents and have patent applications pending in the united states and in foreign countries that relate to various aspects of our products key valuedadded and proprietary products and processes are licensed from our japanese partner daikyo seiko ltd our patents and other proprietary rights have been useful in establishing our market share and in the growth of our business and are expected to continue to be of value in the future as we continue to emphasize development of proprietary products although of importance in the aggregate we do not consider our business to be materially dependent on any individual patent 

we also rely heavily on trade secrets manufacturing knowhow and continuing technological innovations as well as inlicensing opportunities to maintain and further develop our competitive position particularly in the area of formulation development and tooling design 

raw materials 

we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers aluminum and plastic elastomers include both natural and synthetic materials we have access to adequate supplies of these raw materials to meet our production needs through agreements with suppliers and therefore foresee no significant availability problems in the near future 

we utilize a supplychain management strategy in our reporting segments which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply this strategy has reduced the number of our raw material suppliers in most cases we purchase raw materials from a single source to assure quality and reduce costs due to regulatory control over our production processes and the cost and time involved in qualifying suppliers we rely on singlesource suppliers for many critical raw materials this strategy increases the risk that our supply lines may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production problem 

these risks are managed by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites rigid quality control systems surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in case of interruption in production 

seasonality 

although our pharmaceutical systems business is not inherently seasonal thirdquarter sales and operating profit typically are lower compared to other quarters due primarily to plant shutdowns in europe  

working capital 

we are required to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet customer requirements other agreements also require us to purchase inventory in bulk orders which increases inventory levels but decreases the risk of supply interruption levels of inventory are also influenced by the seasonal patterns discussed above for a more detailed discussion of working capital please see the discussion in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition liquidity and capital resource s 

order backlog 

at december 31 2005 our order backlog was 1825 million of which 1818 million is expected to be filled during fiscal year 2006 the order backlog was 1527 million at the end of 2004 this increase was primarily due to business acquisitions during 2005 as well as blanket orders placed by certain customers for the full year and strengthening demand for key products order backlog includes firm orders placed by customers for manufacture over a period of time according to their schedule or upon confirmation by the customer we also have contractual arrangements with a number of our customers and products covered by these contracts are included in our backlog only as orders are received 

competition 

we compete with several companies including some larger than west across our major pharmaceutical systems product lines in addition many companies worldwide compete with us for business related to specific product lines however we believe that we supply a major portion of the us market requirements for pharmaceutical elastomer and metal packaging components and also have a significant share of the european market for these components 

because of the special nature of our pharmaceutical systems packaging components and our longstanding participation in the market competition in that segment is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive costcontrol programs across their entire operations our competitors often compete on the basis of price we differentiate ourselves from our competition as a “fullservice valueadded” global supplier that can provide presale formula and engineering development product compatibility studies regulatory expertise and related services as well as postsale technical support and reliable multisite manufacturing 

our tech group business is in very competitive markets for both healthcare and consumer products the competition varies from smaller regional companies to large global molders that command significant market shares there are extreme cost pressures and many of our customers look offshore to reduce cost we differentiate ourselves by leveraging our global capability and by employing new technologies such as highspeed automated assembly insert molding multishot molding and expertise with multiplepiece closure systems because of the more demanding regulatory requirements in the medicaldevice component area there are a smaller number of other competitors mostly largescale companies we 

compete for this market on the basis of our reputation for quality and reliability in engineering and project management diverse contractmanufacturing capabilities and knowledge of and experience in complying with fda requirements 

employees 

as of december 31 2005 we employed approximately 5570 people in our operations throughout the world 




 item 1a   risk factors

our sales and profitability depend to a large extent on the sale of drug products delivered by injection if the products developed by our customers in the future use another delivery system our sales and profitability could suffer 

our business depends to a substantial extent on customers’ continued sales and development of products that are delivered by injection our customers also develop products that use other delivery means including oral and transmucosal if our customers fail to continue to sell develop and deploy new injectable products or we are unable to develop new products that assist in the delivery of drugs by alternative methods our sales and profitability may suffer 

if we are unable to provide comparative value advantages timely fulfillment of customer orders or resist pricing pressure we will have to reduce our prices which may negatively impact our profit margins 

we compete with several companies across our major product lines because of the special nature of these products competition is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive cost control programs across their entire operations competitors often compete on the basis of price we differentiate ourselves from our competition as a “fullservice valueadded” supplier that is able to provide presale compatibility studies and other services and sophisticated postsale technical support on a global basis however we face continued pricing pressure from our customers and competitors if we are unable to resist or to offset the effects of continued pricing pressure through our valueadded services improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures or if we have to reduce our prices our sales and profitability may suffer 

we have significant indebtedness and debt service payments which could negatively impact our liquidity 

we owe substantial debts and have to commit significant cash flow to debt service requirements the level of our indebtedness among other things could 

·   make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements or other purposes

·   limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and

·   make our financial results and share value more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business

our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to reduce our total indebtedness depends on the results of our product development efforts our future operating performance our ability to generate cash flow from the sale of our products and on general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors affecting our operations many of these factors are beyond our control and our future operating performance could be adversely affected by some or all of these factors 

if we incur new indebtedness in the future the related risks that we now face could intensify whether we are able to make required payments on our outstanding indebtedness and to satisfy any other future debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance and our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing 

we may experience difficulties integrating the recently acquired operations of tgi and medimop and we may incur costs relating to acquisitions that are not anticipated 

our success in integrating the newly acquired tgi and medimop businesses will depend upon our ability to retain key personnel avoid diversion of management’s attention from operational matters integrate general and administrative services and key information processing systems and where necessary requalify on customer programs integration of the acquired operations may take longer or be more costly or disruptive to our business than originally anticipated 

the sellers of these businesses have agreed to indemnify us against certain liabilities connected with the business that may arise in the future because these indemnities are limited in scope and time we may incur liabilities that are not reimbursable under the indemnities 

we are subject to regulation by governments around the world and if these regulations are not complied with existing and future operations may be curtailed and could be subject to liability 

the design development manufacturing marketing and labeling of certain of our products and our customers’ products that incorporate our products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the united states europe and other countries including the fda and the european medicines agency the regulatory process can result in required modification or withdrawal of existing products and a substantial delay in the introduction of new products also it is possible that regulatory approval may not be obtained for a new product in addition our analytical laboratory performs certain contract services for drug manufacturers and is subject to the fda’s current good manufacturing practices regulations we must also register as a contract laboratory with the fda and are subject to periodic inspections by the fda the drug enforcement administration has licensed our contract analytical laboratories to handle and store controlled substances 

failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in actions that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

our business may be adversely affected by changes in the regulation of drug products and devices 

an effect of the governmental regulation of our customers’ drug products devices and manufacturing processes is that compliance with regulations makes it costly and time consuming for customers to substitute or replace components and devices produced by one supplier with those from another in general terms regulation of our customers’ products that incorporate our components and devices has increased over time however if the applicable regulations were to be modified in a way that reduced the cost and time involved for customers to substitute one supplier’s components or devices for those made by another it is likely that the competitive pressure on us would increase and adversely affect our sales and profitability 

our business may be adversely affected by risks typically encountered in international operations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

we conduct business in most of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world sales outside the us account for approximately 51 of consolidated net sales although the general business process is similar to the domestic business international operations are exposed to additional risks including the following fluctuations in currency exchange rates transportation delays and interruptions political and economic 

instability and disruptions especially in latin and south america and israel the imposition of duties and tariffs import and export controls the risks of divergent business expectations or cultural incompatibility inherent in establishing and maintaining operations in foreign countries difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies and potentially adverse tax consequences 

any of these events could have an adverse effect on our international operations in the future by reducing the demand for our products decreasing the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we may not be able to operate in compliance with foreign laws and regulations or comply with applicable customs currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject in the event that these laws or regulations change 

raw material prices have a significant impact on our profitability if raw material prices increase and we cannot pass those price increases on to our customers our profitability and financial condition may suffer 

we use three basic categories of raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers which includes synthetic and natural material aluminum and plastic if we are unable to pass along increased raw material prices to our customers our profitability and thus our financial condition may be adversely affected the cost of these raw materials has a significant impact on our profitability the prices of many of these raw materials are cyclical and volatile for example the prices of certain commodities particularly petroleumbased raw materials have rapidly increased in the recent past increasing the cost of synthetic elastomers and plastic supply and demand factors which are beyond our control generally affect the price of our raw materials while we generally attempt to pass along increased raw material prices to our customers in the form of price increases historically there has been a time delay between increased raw material prices and our ability to increase the prices of our products additionally we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to pricing pressure and other factors 

disruptions in the supply of key raw materials and difficulties in the supplier qualification process could adversely impact our operations 

we utilize a supply chain management strategy in our reporting segments which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply this strategy has reduced the number of raw material suppliers used by us in most cases we purchase raw materials from a single source to assure quality and reduce costs due to regulatory control over our production processes and the cost and time involved in qualifying suppliers we rely on single source suppliers for many critical raw materials this strategy increases the risks that our supply lines may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production problem these risks are managed where possible by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites rigid quality control systems surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in the case of interruption in production 

however should one of our suppliers be unable to supply materials needed for our products or should our strategies for managing these risks be unsuccessful we may be unable to complete the process of qualifying new replacement materials for some programs to be qualified in time to meet future production needs 

prolonged disruptions in the supply of any of our key raw materials difficulty completing qualification of new sources of supply implementing use of replacement materials or new sources of supply could have a material adverse effect on our operating results financial condition or cash flows 

a loss of key personnel or highly skilled employees could disrupt our operations 

our executive officers are critical to the management and direction of our businesses our future success depends in large part on our ability to retain these officers and other capable management personnel with the exception of our chief executive officer in general we do not enter into employment agreements with our executive officers we have entered into severance agreements with several of our officers that allow those officers to terminate their employment under particular circumstances such as a change of control affecting our company although we believe that we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise our inability to do so could disrupt the operations of the unit affected or our overall operations in addition because of the complex nature of many of our products and programs we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled engineering staff and workforce our operations could be disrupted by a shortage of available skilled employees

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 

company overview 

we are a global pharmaceutical technology company that applies proprietary materials science formulation research and manufacturing innovation to the quality therapeutic value development speed and rapid market availability of pharmaceuticals biologics vaccines and consumer products we have manufacturing locations in north and south america europe and asia with partners in mexico and japan we have two reportable segments “pharmaceutical systems” and “tech group” 

our pharmaceutical systems segment focuses on primary packaging components and systems for injectable drug delivery including stoppers and seals for vials and closures and disposable components used in syringe intravenous and blood collection systems the pharmaceutical systems segment has two operating segments that sell a similar range of products manufactured from elastomer and metal components in their respective geographic regions the americas and europeasia the pharmaceutical systems segment includes the results of medimop a company acquired in august 2005 that specializes in reconstitution mixing and fluid transfer technologies for injectable drugs in vials bags ampoules and syringes 

the tech group segment was created following the may 2005 acquisition of substantially all of the american and european assets of the tech group inc “tgi” this segment is composed of our previously existing device group operating unit and the acquired tgi business as a combined unit our tech group segment is a global leader in plastic injection molding offering custom contractmanufacturing solutions for healthcare and consumer industries products and projects include the design and manufacture of unique components and assemblies for surgical ophthalmic diagnostic and drug delivery systems such as contact lens storage kits pill dispensers safety needle and penbased injection systems diagnostic sample containers and components and systems associated with drug inhalation devices the segment also provides molds and assembles consumer product components including printer cartridges resealable closures for juice and dairy products writing pens and markers and socalled smart cards which incorporate electronic readwrite capability into plastic cards

our global customer base includes the world’s leading manufacturers of pharmaceuticals biologics and medical devices while growth in those markets may fluctuate due to a range of factors we anticipate relatively steady growth due to the nature of the products and services we provide we recently introduced valueadded products such as advanced coating technologies flurotec® and b2coating components processed in accordance with the latest regulatory requirements and post manufacturing options westar® that eliminate time and capitalintense operations from customers’ manufacturing processes our service offerings are bolstered through our 2005 acquisition of monarch labs and our engineering and design programs are enhanced through the 2005 acquisition of medimop and tech in addition we will see growth through investment in innovation programs for example we will expand our reconstitution systems portfolio introduce refinements in our prefilled syringe systems and launch a line of vial seals with enhanced product security features 

within the overall pharmaceutical market there are many potential opportunities and challenges that influence our decisions and bear on our future financial performance 

·   we believe that demographic and economic factors are generally favorable for our business these include an aging population that is expected to consume more healthcare products and services the 

increased occurrence and treatment of chronic disorders including diabetes and increased spending on healthcare in the world’s developing economies 

·   we continue to benefit from favorable trends in pharmaceutical product development most notably a majority of new drug product approvals in the us and europe have been of biotechnology products because of their biological content these products are not typically formulated as oral drugs and must be delivered parenterally literally around or avoiding the digestive tract most commonly by injection or iv infusion frequently as a lyophilized freezedried powder that requires reconstitution at the point of use we are the world’s leading manufacturer of elastomer components and seals used in packaging liquid and lyophilized drugs and expect to continue to benefit from the growing use of parenterally administered drugs

·   many of these biologic products have high per dose therapeutic and economic value but are more sensitive to degradation during filling and storage as a result our customers generally employ components that provide the highest level of protection for their products including our teflon® and flurotec® coated products and printed and embossed seals

·   prefilled syringes continue to gain market share for injectable drug products this product presentation is typically more convenient for pharmacists patients and clinicians because it can reduce or eliminate the use of glass ampoules the number of steps and associated error and needle exposures involved in the drug preparation process and permits the drug maker to provide more precise doses

·   in january 2006 the fda and the european medicines agency “ema” granted marketing approval for exubera® inhalation powder a pulmonary insulin product developed by our customer nektar that will be marketed by pfizer inc our tech group is one of two contractmanufacturers for nektar’s inhalation delivery device although the product faces significant challenges in gaining acceptance among physicians and diabetic patients current expectations for the product are positive

particular lines of business that have benefited or will benefit from these trends include prefilled syringe components and coated closures lyophilization stoppers and reconstitution aids which are used in the packaging and pointofuse reconstitution of freezedried drug products seals incorporating anticounterfeiting features and printed product use labeling contractmanufacturing and assembly of systems for inhaled insulin multipleuse injection pens and autoinjectors and laminated materials used in lined seals particularly for the packaging of insulin some of these products and methods replace traditional vials and singleuse syringes and will negatively affect sales of our products for those uses standard vial stoppers and syringe plungers 

other factors that may affect our competitiveness and profitability include 

·   lower cost competitors for both our customers’ drug products that incorporate our components and for our components may increase pricedriven competition for our products these include generic versions of drugs and packaging components sourced from lowercost economies including china and india

·   recent increases in energy and petroleumbased material costs

·   new technologies incorporating oral transdermal or nasal technologies are emerging that compete with traditional injectable drug delivery methods

in order to sustain cost competitiveness we are pursuing a lean manufacturing program that was initiated in 2005 which is focused on reducing our total cost of doing business increasing our production capacity in lowercost locations and evaluating the opportunities to expand our production capabilities by acquiring or constructing an additional facility in asia in order to recoup higher raw material costs we 

increased prices on noncontract sales effective january 1 2006 and have the ability under most of our contracts to increase prices at least annually contract price escalators vary and can include terms that reference either specific commodity prices or general pricelevel increases we believe that the combined effects of cost savings and price increases will neutralize the impact of recent and expected material cost increases 

the 2005 acquisition of tgi is intended to combine our industry and drug product and materials expertise with tgi’s engineering project management molding and assembly capabilities in order to participate in the growing demand for components and devices involved in other routes of drug delivery the 2005 acquisition of medimop medical projects ltd provides us with a number of new products and with new product development expertise focused on the need for safe reliable and convenient drug reconstitution and fluid transfer at the point of use which we are well positioned to market to customers employing our lyophilization products we continue to evaluate opportunities to develop or acquire products manufacturing and service capabilities and expand our geographic reach in order to enhance our ability to meet the developing needs of our pharmaceutical diagnostic medical device and consumer products customers 

our key financial performance indicators include sales and operating income growth earnings per share corporate cash flow operating cash flow less capital expenditures and dividends paid and return on invested capital sales for 2005 were 292 above 2004 levels with the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange translation contributing 197 and 05 percentage points of the increase respectively operating profit in 2005 was 50 higher than in 2004 earnings from continuing operations in 2005 were 139 per diluted share compared to 109 per diluted share in 2004 corporate cash flow in 2005 was 174 million an increase of 66 million over that achieved during 2004 despite higher interest costs connected with 2005 acquisition activity return on invested capital for 2005 was over 9 in addition west’s nonfinancial performance indicators including ontime delivery product discrepancy resolution and compliance tests all indicated high levels of performance and customer satisfaction 

management expects full year 2006 revenues under us gaap to be between 810 and 830 million which would represent approximately 16 to 19 growth over 2005 revenues ten percentage points of this growth reflects the timing of the 2005 acquisitions as us gaap includes revenues for businesses acquired during the year only from the date of acquisition management’s 2006 revenue estimates assume an average exchange rate of 122 us dollars per euro resulting in a decrease of approximately one percentage point in the comparison of projected 2006 to 2005 revenues excluding the timing effect of acquisitions and anticipated foreign currency exchange rate changes we expect revenue growth to be between 7 and 10 management expects that 2006 full year earnings will be between 160 and 170 per diluted share 

as a result of the 2005 acquisition activity our debt level has increased to 2810 million at december 31 2005 with a debt to total capitalization ratio of 454 compared to 348 at december 31 2004 in february 2006 we amended our revolving credit facility to a maximum capacity of 250 million for a term expiring in 2011 and refinanced our 100 million private placement notes as discussed in note 22 to our consolidated financial statements subsequent events—senior notes  the refinancing activities have allowed us to fix the interest rates on the majority of our debt at favorable levels which will result in lower interest costs in future periods we anticipate that the net cash flow generated from operations including those of our acquired businesses will allow us to reduce the debt to total capital ratio by approximately two percentage points by the end of 2006 

results of operations 

management’s discussion and analysis of our operating results for the three years ended december 31 2005 and our financial position as of december 31 2005 should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report the operating results of our former clinical service unit and drug delivery research business are reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented our financial statements include the results of the acquired businesses for periods subsequent to their acquisition date for the purpose of aiding the comparison of our yeartoyear results reference is made in management’s discussion and analysis to results excluding the impact of acquisitions and the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates those remeasured period results are not in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and are “nongaap financial measures” the nongaap financial measures are intended to explain or aid in the use of not as a substitute for the related gaap financial measures 

net sales 

the following table summarizes net sales by reportable segment and product group 

 

  

consolidated 2005 net sales increased 292 over sales reported in 2004 sales in the tgi medimop and monarch businesses are included in 2005 results for periods subsequent to their acquisition date and represented 197 percentage points of the 2005 sales increase versus the prior year favorable foreign exchange rate translation variances contributed 05 percentage points of the 2005 sales increase excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange variances 2005 net sales increased 90 over 2004 sales 

in the pharmaceutical systems segment 2005 net sales were 119 above 2004 levels acquired businesses contributed 77 million of sales to 2005 results 2005 foreign exchange translation variances were 28 million favorable to the prior year excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange 2005 net sales in the pharmaceutical systems segment were 468 million or 97 above those achieved in 2004 sales in international markets were 163 153 excluding exchange effects higher than 2004 levels driven by strong demand for pharmaceutical packaging components used in prefilled syringe systems for the delivery of our customers’ insulin products for diabetes cancer treatments vaccines and dental applications in the united states net sales excluding acquired businesses were 24 over 2004 levels our 2005 sales growth in the united states was moderated by the impact of planned formulation changes in specialty coated stoppers used in serum and lyophilized pharmaceutical packaging products our customers increased their inventory levels of these products during 2004 in order to ensure adequate supplies for 2005 pending approval of the formulation changes this resulted in an 82 million decrease in 

2005 net sales as our customers worked down their inventory levels during the year now that the formulation changes have been approved and accepted by our customers we anticipate a recovery of this business during 2006 in the united states sales of other pharmaceutical packaging products including flipoff® seals and prefilled syringe components disposable medical components used in intravenous fitments and other syringe components and demand for tooling and laboratory services more than offset the impact of the formulation change our westar® line of elastomeric components that have been processed and packaged for direct entry into our customers’ sterilization units continues to benefit from growing customer acceptance with worldwide sales growth of 13 over the prior year 

in our tech group segment 2005 net sales were 1701 million with the acquired tgi business accounting for 989 million of segment sales consisting of healthcare devices 537 million consumer products 223 million and tooling projects 229 million the acquired business’s emphasis on high quality custominjected plastic molding for the pharmaceutical and medical device markets has resulted in strong sales of component parts for surgical devices insulin pens and contact lens casting cups in 2005 the tech group segment recorded 35 million of net sales to nektar inc for validation and other testing in support of a pulmonary delivery device for exubera® inhalation powder an insulin product approved by the fda and ema in january 2006 for the treatment of diabetes excluding the results of the acquired business our previously existing plastic molding operations yielded net sales of 712 million consisting of healthcare devices of 222 million including 83 million to the pharmaceutical systems segment consumer products of 416 million and tooling and design services of 74 million and were 47 above 2004 levels sales of consumer products increased by 165 led by increased demand for custom plastic parts used in orange juice containers the growth in the consumer business was partially offset by declines in healthcare device tooling and other revenues related to the 2004 closure of our uk medical device facility 

consolidated 2004 net sales increased 12 over sales reported in 2003 approximately 5 of the sales increase resulted from the strengthening of the euro and other currencies against the us dollar in foreign currency exchange markets sales in the united states were almost 10 above prior year levels while sales in international markets increased by 14 over 2003 9 of which was due to foreign currency translation in the pharmaceutical systems segment sales were 467 million above 2003 results with favorable foreign exchange rates contributing 225 million of the increase sales of specialty coated serum and lyophilized stoppers accounted for 142 million of the increase with much of the demand attributed to customers increasing inventory levels prior to formulation changes in the coating process the pharmaceutical systems segment also benefited from a 48 million increase in sales of components used in the packaging of an ulcer treatment drug and increases in personal care products including babynurser nipples produced in brazil the 2004 sales increase in the laboratory and other services category is largely attributed to increased tooling and engineering design service revenue on product development projects in the tech group segment which in 2004 consisted only of our previously existing plastic device unit 2004 revenue increases were led by strong sales of consumer packaging components principally related to fresh juice packaging and related low margin customer tooling revenues which more than offset a decline in 2004 healthcare device sales connected to the closure of our plastic device manufacturing facility in the united kingdom 

gross profit 

consolidated gross profit improved to 1926 million in 2005 a 367 million increase over 2004 results the acquired businesses contributed 15 million of the increase in gross profit principally within the tech group segment the pharmaceutical systems segment accounted for the remaining gross profit increase generated by higher sales volumes in europe and improved operating efficiencies in north america resulting from the resumption of normal molding operations at our rebuilt kinston north carolina facility our consolidated gross margin was 275 in 2005 and 288 in 2004 the impact of the 

acquired businesses on our consolidated gross margin in 2005 was a reduction of 24 percentage points reflecting the increase in lower margin revenues within the acquired tgi business gross margins in the pharmaceutical systems segment improved by 11 percentage points over the prior year as many of the interim production costs incurred during the 2004 construction and validation of the new facility were not incurred during 2005 the decreased interim production costs were partially offset by higher depreciation plant overhead and utility costs at the new plant sales price increases helped to offset higher raw material energy and labor costs but produced no net improvement in gross margin overall product mix variances in 2005 were negligible as the decline in higher margin coated product sales within the pharmaceutical systems segment were offset by increased sales of prefilled syringe systems and westar®processed products with similar margins tech group segment gross margins include the impact of tooling revenues which carry gross margins averaging three percent excluding tooling tech group segment gross margins on healthcare and consumer products average approximately 16 of net sales 

gross profit and gross margin by segment 

 

  

in 2004 our consolidated gross margin declined by 29 percentage points to 288 versus 317 in 2003 the majority of the decrease in the gross margin within our pharmaceutical systems segment was associated with the costs incurred in implementing interim production strategies following the january 2003 explosion at our production facility in kinston north carolina during 2003 these costs totaled 98 million but were completely offset by business interruption insurance reimbursements we reached a settlement agreement with our insurer at the end of 2003 and as a result of the agreement no further insurance coverage was available for costs incurred in subsequent periods in 2004 similar costs totaling 116 million were incurred resulting in a 24 percentage point decline in pharmaceutical systems segment gross margins and a 21 percentage point decrease in consolidated gross margin during 2004 we completed the reconstruction of molding operations at a new facility in kinston and by the fourth quarter of 2004 the majority of the costs associated with the interim production plans had ceased tech group segment gross margins were relatively consistent over the three year period with most of the 2004 improvement over 2003 reflecting the favorable impact of the closure of a uk production facility 

selling general and adminstrative costs 

consolidated selling general and administrative “sga” expenses were 1203 million in 2005 compared to 1052 million in 2004 sga costs within the acquired business units accounted for 98 million of the increase the following table reports selling general and administrative costs by reportable segment including corporate and unallocated costs for the threeyear period ended december 31 2005 

 

  

pharmaceutical systems segment sga costs increased by 81 million over 2004 levels sga costs within the acquired medimop and monarch labs businesses accounted for 18 million of the increase higher compensation costs of 42 million associated with annual salary increases and sales incentive programs increased consulting costs of 15 million for information systems projects ‘lean’ manufacturing programs and marketing studies and unfavorable foreign exchange variances of 06 million accounted for the remainder of the 2005 increase in pharmaceutical systems segment sga costs over 2004 pharmaceutical systems sga in 2004 was 63 million higher than in 2003 due to 30 million of foreign exchange rate variances 22 million in compensation cost increases and 11 million of consulting costs associated with business development and sarbanesoxley compliance activities 

2005 tech group segment sga costs increased by 78 million over 2004 with the acquired business accounting for 80 million of the variance offset by a small decline in consulting costs within the previously existing plastic device unit in 2004 tech group segment sga costs increased by 08 million compared to 2003 principally due to increased staffing of sales and marketing functions 

general corporate costs include executive officer costs board of director’s compensation legal compliance finance and communication expenses in 2005 these costs decreased by 22 million from 2004 levels primarily as a result of a 14 million decrease in stock priceindexed board of director’s compensation plans and a 08 million decrease in legal fees connected with the 2003 kinston explosion and related fire in 2004 general corporate costs exceeded 2003 levels by 33 million primarily due to 17 million in legal costs associated with finalizing regulatory investigations and responding to plaintiffs in lawsuits filed in connection with kinston accidentrelated matters other 2004 versus 2003 general corporate cost increases included a 10 million increase in stockbased board of director’s compensation fees and a 06 million increase in other professional service fees consisting principally of increased legal and patent costs 

compensation costs for performance vesting restricted share awards to senior management “pvr share awards” under the 2004 stockbased compensation plan were 37 million and 51 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively the 14 million decline in costs associated with the pvr share plan principally reflects the expense connected with an initial 2004 performance award which vested entirely upon 2004 

results rather than the two and three year performance periods associated with subsequent awards please refer to note 19 stock option and award plans  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included within item 8 of this report for additional details on the pvr share award program 

effective january 1 2005 we adopted statement of financial accounting standard 123 “sharebased payment—revised 2004” “sfas 123r” using the modified prospective transition method which requires that stockbased employee compensation costs be measured at fair value and recorded as an expense over the requisite service period additionally compensation costs for unvested stock options and awards that are outstanding at january 1 2005 will be recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period based on the grantdate fair value of those options and awards as previously calculated under the proforma disclosures under sfas 123r prior to the adoption of sfas 123r our stock option plans did not result in expense recognition under the intrinsic value method for stockbased compensation prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations the 27 million charge recorded in selling general and administrative costs in 2005 consists of 19 million for stock option programs and 08 million associated with our employee stock purchase plan which allows employees to purchase west shares at 85 of the market price at the beginning or end of a sixmonth offering period “a lookback option” an additional 10 million of employee stock purchase plan costs associated with manufacturing employees was recorded in cost of goods and services sold within the pharmaceutical systems segment total compensation expense related to the adoption of fas 123r accounted for 008 per diluted share during 2005 in early 2006 the employee stock purchase plan was modified eliminating the “lookback option” requiring employees to contribute to the plan through payroll deductions only and establishing quarterly offering periods if the fair value based method prescribed by sfas 123r had been applied to earlier periods our results would have included additional pretax stock compensation costs for stock options and the employee stock purchase plan of 18 million and 23 million for the years 2004 and 2003 respectively 

in 2005 us pension plan expenses remained approximately even with 2004 levels as the recovery of equity markets during 2003 increased the value of pension plan assets resulting in higher investment income in subsequent periods in 2006 we anticipate that us pension expenses will increase to approximately 90 million due to higher benefit obligation liabilities generated by changes in actuarial mortality assumptions and the decrease in the discount rate 565 at december 31 2005 versus 575 at december 31 2004 used to measure plan liabilities 

insurance settlement 

on january 29 2003 our kinston nc plant suffered an explosion and related fire that resulted in six deaths a number of injured personnel and substantial damage to the building machinery and equipment and raw material inventories our property and business interruption coverage with our principal insurer provided for a maximum insurance recovery of 66 million we reached an agreement with our insurer that the total losses for business interruption insured incremental costs and property replacement would exceed the maximum recoverable amount resulting in the final settlement of the insurance claim for the full 66 million reimbursement the final accounting for the insurance settlement and related costs is presented below 

 

  

restructuring charges 

in connection with the closure of a plastic device manufacturing plant in the united kingdom we have recorded a favorable restructuringrelated adjustment of 13 million in 2005 following restructuring charges of 10 million and 70 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively 

the 2003 decision to close the uk plant followed a decision by a marketing and distribution partner of our customer to terminate its involvement with the principal product produced by the facility the initial 70 million charge recorded in 2003 included an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value and the expected fair value of the equipment at this site asset retirement obligations at the leased facilities and a provision for statutory postemployment benefit costs deemed probable of being paid during 2004 we transferred the remaining customers of the plant to other west facilities ceased all production activities at the uk operation and recorded a 10 million restructuring charge for the excess of future lease costs over expected sublease rental income as well as additional severance expense and repair costs necessary to return the leased facility to its original condition in 2005 we reached final settlement of all remaining lease obligations resulting in reduction of previously estimated cost accruals of 13 million 

other expense income 

other expense income was 14 million 15 million and 06 million for years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

 

  

2005 results include a 05 million impairment of an investment in a company that had been developing genomics analysis technology following that company’s unsuccessful efforts in finding a commercial sponsor 

operating profit 

operating profit loss by reportable segment corporate and other unallocated costs were as follows 

 

  

the businesses acquired during 2005 contributed 52 million pharmaceutical systems 17 million and tech group 35 million of the 240 million consolidated operating profit increase over 2004 the remaining 2005 to 2004 operating profit improvement in the pharmaceutical systems segment of 132 million was principally the result of increased sales volumes in europe and lower production costs in the united states following the resumption of normal production activities at our kinston facility the comparison of 2004 pharmaceutical systems operating profit to 2003 is affected by a 98 million insurance reimbursement for business interruption costs recorded in 2003 as a result of the final insurance settlement recorded at the end of 2003 no additional insurance coverage was available to offset similar costs incurred in subsequent periods tech group segment operating profit improved throughout the three year period ending in 2005 principally benefiting from the acquisition of the tgi business and cost savings following the closure of the former uk facility at the end of 2003 

interest expense net 

the following table summarizes our net interest expense for the threeyear period ended december 31 2005 

 

  

2005 net interest expense increased 50 million over the prior year as a result of the 2005 acquisition activity average borrowing levels increased by 478 in 2005 and accounted for 40 million of the interest expense increase total debt outstanding at december 31 2005 was 2810 million compared to 1608 million at december 31 2004 the remaining 10 million increase in 2005 interest expense was caused by higher interest rates on variable rate borrowings under our revolving credit facility the average interest rate on variable rate borrowings was 48 in 2005 compared to 31 in 2004 

net interest expense declined 05 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 results largely as a result of lower average debt levels and an increase in capitalized interest associated with the kinston construction project 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate on consolidated income from continuing operations was 288 in 2005 270 in 2004 and 360 in 2003 

in 2005 we repatriated 1660 million in earnings from foreign subsidiaries to the united states parent companies the foreign repatriations were made in accordance with the provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 “ajca” the ajca provided a temporary incentive for us multinational companies to repatriate accumulated income earned in controlled foreign corporations by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction on qualified distributions occurring before december 31 2005 our results include a 15 million net tax charge 52 million gross tax cost less 24 million of foreign tax credits and 13 million in previously established accruals for unremitted earnings incurred in connection with the repatriation program which increased our overall 2005 effective tax rate by 25 percentage points the 2005 restructuring credit in the uk allowed us to utilize prior year loss carryforwards and therefore decreased our 2005 effective tax rate by 06 percentage points in addition we reduced tax contingencies connected with the closure of tax years in certain international locations resulting in a 29 percentage point reduction in the 2005 effective tax rate 

the 2004 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the utilization of foreign tax credits on the filing of a prior year us tax return a change in french tax law extending the life of net operating loss carryforwards and the reversal of reserves attributable to the closing of tax years the combined impact of these items offset partially by the nondeductible restructuring charge resulted in a 45 percentage point reduction in the 2004 effective tax rate 

the 2003 effective tax rate was unfavorably affected by the impairment charge in the united kingdom which did not result in a tax benefit as management does not expect to generate future taxable income in the specific uk legal entity sufficient to utilize net operating loss carryforwards additionally management provided a 05 million valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset connected with this location that was unlikely to be realized these items increased the 2003 effective tax rate by 37 percentage points 

equity in affiliates 

the contribution to earnings from our 25 ownership interest in daikyo seiko ltd in japan and 49 ownership interest in three companies in mexico was income of 24 million 34 million and 16 million for the years 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the results achieved during the last two years reflect the impact on daikyo’s results of customer purchases during 2004 of a product in advance of a pending fda approval of a required product reformulation the increased customer inventory levels accumulated during 2004 resulted in lower sales levels for daikyo in 2005 as customers utilized existing inventory pending validation of the new formulation the 2005 operating results of the mexican affiliates improved on strong sales growth generating results equal to those recorded in 2004 which included a nonoperating 06 million gain on the sale of real estate 

our purchases from all affiliates totaled approximately 206 million in 2005 286 million in 2004 and 184 million in 2003 the majority of which relates to our distributorship agreement with daikyo which allows us to purchase and resell daikyo products sales to affiliates were 05 million 06 million and 07 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

income from continuing operations 

our 2005 net income from continuing operations was 452 million or 139 per diluted share these results included incremental income tax expense of 15 million or 005 per diluted share associated with the repatriation of foreign sourced income under the american jobs creation act of 2004 results for 2005 also include a restructuring credit which increased net income from continuing operations by 13 million or 04 per diluted share 

net income from continuing operations in 2004 was 335 million or 109 per diluted share results for 2004 include incremental manufacturing costs of 116 million 79 million net of tax or 026 per share associated with the interim production processes that were put in place following the kinston accident in the prior year these incremental manufacturing costs were reimbursed under insurance coverage 2004 results also include kinstonrelated legal expenses of 17 million 12 million net of tax or 004 per share the closure of a manufacturing plant in the uk resulted in 2004 restructuring charges of 10 million 003 per share equity income included a 06 million 002 per share real estate gain 2004 results also include 21 million 007 per share of favorable tax adjustments resulting from utilization of foreign tax credits on the filing of a prior year tax return and a change in french tax legislation 

net income from continuing operations in 2003 was 429 million or 148 per diluted share results for 2003 included a net gain from an insurance settlement of 173 million 121 million net of tax or 042 per share and asset impairment and postemployment benefit charges at the uk device operation of 70 million 75 million including a related tax charge or 026 per share 

discontinued operations 

2005 income from discontinued operations was 04 million or 001 per diluted share the majority of the income was generated from the august 2005 sale of the clinical services unit pretax gain of 07 million 05 million net of tax operating losses and other costs associated with the sale of our former drug delivery business completed in the first quarter of 2005 totaled 19 million 11 million net of tax more than offsetting the operating income of 16 million 10 million net of tax generated by the clinical services unit prior to its divestiture 

in december 2004 we entered into a share and asset purchase agreement to sell our drug delivery business to a new company formed by warburg pincus private equity viii and warburg pincus international partners to facilitate the acquisition the sales price consisted of 71 million receivable due in cash at the 2005 closing date and a 14 ownership interest in the new company valued at 10 million as a result of the transaction we recorded a pretax loss of 47 million 52 million aftertax or 017 per diluted share the 05 million net tax expense is primarily the result of the reversal of current and prior year tax benefits that may no longer be available as a result of the transaction in december 2004 we also announced our intention to exit the clinical services business the operating results of the drug delivery business and clinical service unit are classified within discontinued operations for all periods presented the pretax loss from the discontinued drug delivery and clinical services operations was 135 million and 175 million for the years 2004 and 2003 respectively 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

cash flows generated from operations totaled 856 million in 2005 compared to 810 million in 2004 operating cash flows improved in all geographic regions with the strongest growth occurring in north america reflecting the restart of operations at our kinston facility and a corresponding decrease in interim production costs 2004 operating cash flows include 92 million of insurance collections received in 2004 that helped to offset the payment of liabilities related to the 2003 kinston accident 

consolidated capital spending for 2005 totaled 541 million compared to 574 million in 2004 which included 131 million related to the construction of the new kinston molding operation the pharmaceutical systems segment accounted for 383 million of our total 2005 capital spending consisting of 290 million in equipment replacements rubber tooling projects and facility improvements 61 million in plant expansion activity in europe and 32 million in information systems projects 2005 capital spending for equipment and facility upgrades within the tech group segment totaled 132 million of which 79 million related to projects within the acquired business general corporate and other projects account for the remaining 26 million of 2005 capital expenditures we anticipate that total 2006 capital spending will be approximately 680 million pharmaceutical systems segment 480 million tech group segment 180 million and general corporate 20 million approximately 330 million of the 2006 projected capital spending is targeted for normal equipment replacements facility maintenance and tooling projects the 2006 capital spending estimate also includes 260 million in new product and expansion projects and 90 million in information systems upgrades 

2005 cash flows from investing activities include the february 10 2005 acquisition of monarch a contract laboratory business the may 20 2005 purchase of tgi a plastic device and molding business and the august 2 2005 acquisition of medimop a business focused on reconstitution and mixing technologies for injectable products the following table summarizes the total purchase price paid for each business 

 

  

2005 cash flows provided by investing operations include a 02 million loan repayment received from our affiliate in mexico and 13 million in proceeds from surplus equipment sales cash provided by investing activities in 2004 includes 318 million of insurance proceeds related to the kinston accident which helped to fund the reconstruction of the new facility

at december 31 2005 our consolidated debt was 2810 million and our debttototal invested capital total debt minority interest and shareholders’ equity ratio was 454 compared to 348 at december 31 2004 our cash and cash equivalents balance was 488 million at december 31 2005 compared to 688 million at december 31 2004 both the increase in debt levels and decrease in cash were incurred to support the acquisition activity in 2005 our december 31 2005 net working capital totaled 1124 million and the ratio of current assets to liabilities was 19 to 1 we believe that our financial condition current capitalization and expected income from operations will continue to be sufficient to meet our future expected cash requirements 

offbalance sheet agreements 

at december 31 2005 the company had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business and outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs and equipment lease guarantees as noted above 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions some of which are subjective and complex that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements management believes the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating the results of operations and financial position of west pharmaceutical services inc 

revenue recognition   sales of manufactured components are recorded at the time title and risk of loss passes to the customer some customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes management records rebate costs based on its assessment of the likelihood that these volumes will be attained we also establish product return liabilities for customer quality claims when such amounts are deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated revenue associated with tooling and other engineering service agreements is recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting for agreements with multiple deliverables we assess whether more than one unit of accounting exists if more than one unit exists revenue for each separate unit based on the calculated allocation is recorded as earned

impairment of longlived assets   we review goodwill and longlived assets annually and whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment as part of the operating segment to which it belongs we have determined our operating segments to be the americas and europeasia divisions of the pharmaceutical systems segment and the tech group segment for assets held and used in the business management estimates the future cash flows to be derived from the related asset or business unit when assets are held for sale management determines fair value by estimating the anticipated proceeds to be received upon the sale of the asset less disposition costs changes in the estimate of fair value including the estimate of future cash flows could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position

employee benefits   the measurement of the obligations under our defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plans are subject to a number of assumptions these include the rate of return on plan assets and the rate at which the future obligations are discounted to present value for us plans which account for over 90 of global plan assets the longterm rate of return assumption decreased to 875 in 2005 from 90 in 2004 in 2006 the longterm rate of return assumption is 800 the return assumption is reviewed annually and determined by the projected return over a 10year period for the expected mix of plan assets approximately 65 equity and 35 debt securities the discount rate was reduced 10 basis points to 565 at december 31 2005 to reflect current market conditions the discount rate selected is the single rate equivalent for a theoretical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that produces a cash flow pattern equivalent to the plans’ projected benefit payments changes in these estimates including the market performance of plan assets and other actuarial assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position every 25 basis point reduction in the longterm rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by approximately 05 million a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately 07 million in addition restructuring events such as plant closures or changes in pension plan provisions could result in curtailment or settlement of pension plan obligations which would result in gain or loss recognition in the period when such an event occurs

we are currently monitoring the progress of a financial accounting standards board fasb project to comprehensively reconsider the guidance in fasb statement 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and fasb statement 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” one of the current recommendations of the project is to recognize the funded status of a pension plan on the balance sheet under the current standard the funded status of a plan is disclosed in the footnotes differences between expected and actual experience and plan amendments are currently reflected in the footnote disclosure as “unrecognized actuarial gains or losses” or “unrecognized prior 

service costs” and are amortized into expense over future service periods as currently defined the fasb project on pensions recommends the recognition of a liability for any underfunded pension plan where the projected benefit obligation of the plan exceeds the fair value of its assets if the proposed standard were in effect at december 31 2005 we would be required to record an 187 million liability for our us qualified pension plan rather than the 455 million asset currently reflected on our balance sheet the impact of these changes would reduce shareholders equity by 417 million 642 million pretax less a 225 million reduction of deferred tax liabilities the fasb expects to issue an exposure draft for public comment in march 2006 and currently intends that the proposed changes would apply to fiscal years ending after december 15 2006 

income taxes   we estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation in addition deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established to recognize differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities we maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized the recoverability of tax assets is subject to our estimates of future profitability generally at the local subsidiary company and country level changes in tax legislation business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined

during 2005 the fasb published and deliberated an exposure draft “accounting for uncertain tax positions—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 proposed interpretation” this project seeks to clarify what criteria must be met prior to recognition of the financial statement benefit of a position taken in a tax return currently we record the benefit of an uncertain tax position only when it is realized or probable that our position will be sustained under the proposed interpretation a tax position would be recognized when the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not based solely on the technical merits that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the board expects the final interpretation which would include amendments to statement 109 to be effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 and will encourage earlier application management has not yet determined what impact if any the proposed changes may have on our financial statements 

inventories   accounting for inventories involves estimates regarding the proper determination of manufacturing cost obsolescence and identifying inventory values that exceed estimated market values the determination of manufacturing cost includes the identification of direct material costs and allocations of direct labor variable production costs and overhead allocations of fixed overhead costs are based on estimates of normal capacity and require judgment when production levels are below normal so that idle capacity costs are expensed in the period incurred the valuation of inventories is also subject to usage or ‘flow’ assumptions over 70 of our inventory is accounted for under a combination of the firstin firstout fifo and average cost inventory usage methods the remaining inventory primarily located in the united states is accounted for under the lastin firstout lifo method we are currently evaluating the possibility of converting all domestic west pharmaceutical services locations to the fifo method management expects to complete its evaluation during the first quarter of 2006 a change from lifo to fifo would not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk  

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates the following describes the nature of these risks all debt securities and derivative instruments are considered nontrading 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have subsidiaries outside the us accounting for approximately 51 of consolidated net sales virtually all of these sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into us dollars although the majority of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are in the local currency of the subsidiary and are therefore also translated into us dollars the foreign subsidiaries may hold assets or liabilities not denominated in their local currency these items may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains and losses as a result our results of operations and financial position are exposed to changing exchange rates we periodically use forward contracts to hedge certain transactions or to neutralize monthend balance sheet exposures on crosscurrency intercompany loans we have forward contracts with a combined fair market value of 100 thousand as of december 31 2005 to sell currencies in asia we also have an outstanding loan denominated in japanese yen to hedge the investment in our japanese affiliate at december 31 2005 a 200 thousand loss is included in the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment related to this hedge 

interest rate risk 

as a result of our normal borrowing activities we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates which we manage primarily through our financing activities we have longterm debt with both fixed and variable interest rates longterm debt consists of senior notes revolving credit facilities and capital lease obligations portions of longterm debt which are payable during 2006 are classified as shortterm liabilities as of december 31 2005 

the following table summarizes our interest rate risksensitive instruments

 item 1 business 

general 

west pharmaceutical services inc “west” or “the company” was incorporated in 1923 under the laws of the state of pennsylvania the executive offices of the company are located at 101 gordon drive po box 645 lionville pennsylvania 193410645 approximately 35 miles from philadelphia the telephone number at the company’s executive offices is 6105942900 as used in this item the term “company” includes west pharmaceutical services inc and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise indicates 

description of business 

west pharmaceutical services inc develops manufactures and sells components and systems used for injectable drug delivery these components include elastomeric stoppers and aluminum seals for vials multipiece tamperresistant plastic and aluminum closures and components used in syringe intravenous and blood collection systems west also provides plastic systems and components for use in over the counter “otc” drugs personal care and food and beverage applications 

west’s primary pharmaceutical packaging components stoppers and plungers are available with advanced coatings and barrier films such as flurotec® teflon® and b2coating teflon® is a registered trademark of ei dupont de nemours and company flurotec® is a fluoropolymer film applied to rubber stoppers and plungers to prevent the migration of rubber constituents into the formulation and to prevent the absorption of drug constituents into the rubber stopper resulting in additional protection of the shelf life of packaged drugs b2coating technology applies a coating to the surface of rubber stoppers and plungers to improve surface lubricity and reduce the need for conventional silicon oil the improved lubricity of these advanced technologies reduces friction on the packaging components as they pass through drug manufacturers’ filling lines leading to significant improvements to the manufacturers’ production process without the use of silicon oil 

in addition to the coating technologies the company offers a postmanufacturing process westar® rs westar® rs ready to sterilize is a documented fully validated procedure for washing and cleaning stoppers and syringe components to remove biological materials and endotoxins prior to sterilization the westar® process eliminates steps otherwise required in customers’ manufacturing processes westar® ru ready to use currently in development will provide components presterilized and ready for direct introduction into our customers’ aseptic filling suites 

the company also manufactures secondary closures for pharmaceutical vials called flipoff® aluminum seals these secondary closures consist of an aluminum seal and removable plastic button and in some applications just an aluminum seal these components are sold in various sizes and colors and provide customers with product identification differentiation and tamper evidency for secondary closures the company is working with customers to provide anticounterfeiting features such as inmold decorating radio frequency identification rfid tags and infrared printing 

the company’s quality control regulatory and laboratory testing capabilities are used to ensure compliance within applicable manufacturing and regulatory standards for primary and secondary pharmaceutical packaging components 

additional product offerings include components and systems for otc drug and consumer markets these products manufactured from plastics include childresistant and tamperevident closures dispensers for personal care products such as unique toothpaste dispensers and spoutpak® components used to seal beverage containers spoutpak® is a registered trademark of international paper 

in addition to revenues from product sales the company offers contract analytical laboratory services for testing and evaluating primary drug packaging components and their compatability with the contained drug formulation and contract engineering design and development services to assist customers with new product development 

the company operates in a single reportable segment referred to as the pharmaceutical systems segment this reportable segment consists of three operating segments the americas europeasia and the device group the americas and europeasia business units manufacture and sell products into the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical markets in their respective regions the device group focuses on development and sale of products sold into the diagnostic otc drug and consumer markets manufacturing and distribution within the pharmaceutical systems segment is integrated as needed to satisfy global market demand 

please see note 7 “segment information” of the notes to consolidated financial statements included within item 8 of this report 

as of december 31 2004 the company and its subsidiaries had 4350 employees 

product development 

the company maintains its own laboratories for testing raw materials and finished goods to assure conformity to customer specifications and to safeguard product quality the company’s laboratories also conduct tests to determine the compatibility of its rubber components with customers’ drugs in the united states “us” rubber formulation information is filed with the food and drug administration “fda” which is used in support of customers’ drug applications the analytical laboratories also provide specialized testing for drug delivery systems and container closure components specializing in extractables and leachable testing for customers on a contract basis the laboratory facilities are also used for development of new products the company’s engineering departments are responsible for product and tooling design and testing and for the design and construction of processing equipment in addition a corporate product development department develops new packaging and device concepts in 2004 57 professional employees were engaged in these activities development and engineering expenditures for the creation and application of new and improved device products and manufacturing processes were 64 million in 2004 63 million in 2003 and 54 million in 2002 

government regulation 

the fda extensively regulates the research development testing manufacture labeling promotion advertising distribution and marketing of drugs in the us under the food drug and cosmetic act the company’s businesses are involved in a number of activities regulated by the fda and by comparable regulatory agencies in other countries 

the company’s drug packaging components including stoppers seals and syringe plungers are used to package drug products that are regulated by the fda to accommodate the needs of its customers which manufacture drug products the company must maintain detailed written procedures for the receipt identification storage handling sampling testing and approval or rejection of its products before shipment samples from each lot of components must be tested for conformance with applicable specifications manufacturing facilities must establish and conform to written procedures for production and process controls and must create and retain records for a specified period of time 

the company’s analytical laboratory performs certain contract services for drug manufacturers and is subject to the fda’s current good manufacturing practices “cgmp” regulations it must also register as a contract laboratory with the fda and is subject to periodic inspections by the fda the drug enforcement administration has licensed the contract laboratory to handle and store controlled substances 

order backlog 

at december 31 2004 the company’s order backlog was 1527million of which 1451 million is expected to be filled during fiscal year 2005 the order backlog was 1316 million at the end of 2003 order backlog includes firm orders placed by customers for manufacture over a period of time according to a customer’s schedule or upon confirmation by the customer the company also has contractual arrangements with a number of its customers and products covered by these contracts are included in the company’s backlog only as orders are received from those customers 

raw materials 

the company uses three basic raw materials in the manufacture of its pharmaceutical systems products elastomers aluminum and plastic the company has access to adequate supplies of raw materials to meet its production needs and therefore foresees no significant availability problems in the near future 

the company is pursuing a supply chain management strategy in its pharmaceutical systems reporting segment which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply this strategy has reduced the number of raw material suppliers used by the company in most cases the company will purchase raw materials from a single source to assure quality and reduce costs due to regulatory control over our production processes and the cost and time involved in qualifying suppliers the company relies on single source suppliers for many critical raw materials this strategy increases the risks that the company’s supply lines may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production problem these risks are managed by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites rigid quality control systems surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in case of interruption in production 

patents trademarks and proprietary rights 

it is the company’s policy to maintain a strong patent position by obtaining patent protection on products and processes deemed to possess potential commercial significance this policy applies to patents resulting from the efforts of the company’s research and engineering staff or through the research and development of others financed by the company the company relies on trade secret protection for many of its rubber and elastomer formulations the company also relies upon trademarks knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and further develop its competitive position 

employees and consultants outside scientific collaborators sponsored researchers and other advisors who receive confidential information are required to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships the agreements provide that all inventions by an employee shall be the company’s property 

the company’s patents trademarks and proprietary rights that relate to the pharmaceutical systems reporting segment have been useful in establishing the company’s market share and in the growth of the company’s business and are expected to continue to be of value in the future as the company continues to develop its proprietary products in this segment although of importance in the aggregate the company does not consider its current pharmaceutical systems segment business or its earnings to be materially dependent on any single patent trademark or proprietary right 

markets and major customers 

the company provides components andor contract services to major pharmaceutical biotechnology and hospital supplymedical device companies products and services are distributed primarily through the company’s own sales force with nominal use of regional distributors 

becton dickinson and company “bd” accounted for approximately 11 of the company’s 2004 consolidated net sales the principal products sold to bd are synthetic rubber natural rubber metal and plastic components used in bd’s disposable and prefilled syringes and blood sampling and analysis systems the company expects to continue to be a major bd supplier 

excluding bd the next ten largest customers accounted for approximately 34 of the company’s consolidated net sales in 2004 but not one of these customers accounted for more than 5 of 2004 consolidated net sales 

competition 

the company competes with several companies some of which are larger than the company across its major pharmaceutical systems product lines in addition many companies worldwide compete with the company for business related to specific product lines however the company believes that it supplies a major portion of the us market requirements for pharmaceutical elastomer and metal packaging components and also has a significant share of the european market for these components 

because of the special nature of these products competition is based primarily on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive cost control programs across their entire operations competitors often compete on the basis of price the company differentiates itself from its competition as a “fullservice valueadded” supplier that is able to provide presale compatibility studies and other services and sophisticated postsale technical support on a global basis

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management’s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 

business overview 

west pharmaceutical services inc “the company” is the world’s leading manufacturer of primary packaging components and systems for injectable drug delivery including stoppers and seals for vials and closures and disposable components used in syringe intravenous and blood collection systems west’s customers include the world’s leading pharmaceutical biotechnology generic drug and medical device producers the company has manufacturing locations in north and south america europe and singapore with partners in mexico and japan 

the company’s business is organized into a single reportable segment referred to as the pharmaceutical systems segment the pharmaceutical systems segment consists of three operating segments the americas europeasia and the device group the americas and europeasia business units manufacture and sell the majority of the company’s elastomer and metal component products in their respective geographic regions the device group focuses on the development and sale of product delivery systems relying heavily on plastic injection molding 

the pharmaceutical systems segment operates in a global market growing annually at a rate of approximately 2 to 3 in unit volume the company has achieved growth above this level by introducing valueadding enhancements such as advanced coating technologies flurotec® and teflon® and postmanufacturing processes westar® that promote drug formulation stability and eliminate time and capitalintense operations from customers’ manufacturing processes respectively 

favorable business drivers for the pharmaceutical systems segment include the increase in fda regulations and enforcement of good manufacturing processes which create a need for stable sourcing of critical components used in both pharmaceutical and biotechnology products increased customer demand for anticounterfeiting technology and global demographics 

the company’s ability to achieve its longterm goals depends upon a number of factors including possible healthcare cost containment initiatives increased competition and changes in global economic conditions including the strength or weakness of the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies although inflation has not had a material impact in recent years the impact of continuing demand in china and high energy costs is expected to increase the company’s cost of raw materials particularly with regard to plastic resins aluminum and synthetic and natural rubber materials that are used in the manufacture of most of the company’s products 

the financial position of the company remains strong debt to total capitalization improved to 35 and cash on hand increased to 688 million at december 31 2004 the recent divestiture of the drug delivery business will free up additional resources and provide for increased funding of innovative new product offerings along with business development opportunities for the pharmaceutical systems segment product group as further discussed below and in note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included within item 8 of this report on december 24 2004 the company agreed to sell its drug delivery business in return for cash assumed debt and a 14 ownership interest in a new company in addition the company has also determined that it will dispose of its clinical services unit located in evansville indiana for financial reporting purposes the operating results of the drug delivery business and clinical services unit have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

results of operation s 

net sales 

the following table summarizes the company’s sales by product group 

 in millions 2004 2003 2002  pharmaceutical packaging 3829 3412 2862 disposable medical components 996 1004 886 personal carefood packaging 400 322 307 laboratory and other services 191 96 73  net sales 5416 4834 4128  consolidated 2004 net sales increased 12 over sales reported in 2003 approximately 5 of the sales increase resulted from the strengthening of the euro and other currencies against the us dollar sales in the us were almost 10 above prior year levels while sales in international markets increased by 14 over 2003 9 of which was due to foreign currency translation sales of specially treated stoppers used in serum and lyophilized pharmaceutical packaging products led the sales growth over the prior year approximately 100 million of the pharmaceutical packaging sales growth is attributed to products sold under a distributorship arrangement with daikyo seiko ltd the company’s 25 owned affiliate located in japan and is partially attributed to customers increasing inventory levels in advance of a formulation change in the b2–coating process the company also experienced a 48 million increase in sales of components used in the packaging of an ulcer treatment drug with continued demand expected in 2005 an additional 42 million in sales growth is attributed to other customers’ build of inventory prior to a formulation change in teflon® film barriers and the recapture of business from multiple competitors the sales of disposable medical components were affected by the loss of orders for an applicator device used to apply a hair growth stimulant within products destined for the personal carefood packaging market the sales growth was led by increased demand in domestic markets for custom plastic fittings used in beverage containers and an increase in baby nurser nipples produced in brazil the increase in the laboratory and other service category is largely attributed to increased tooling and engineering design and development service revenue on product development projects overall price increases accounted for less than 10 of the sales increase over 2003 the sales order backlog at december 31 2004 was 1527 million versus 1316 million at december 31 2003 the increase in the backlog is attributed to growth in the us mostly due to the advance orders from a biotechnology firm 77 million favorable foreign exchange rates 72 million and generally strong demand in international markets 62 million 

consolidated 2003 net sales increased 17 over sales reported in 2002 approximately 7 of the sales increase resulted from the strengthening of the euro and other currencies against the us dollar sales were strong both in international markets 25 growth over 2002 16 of which was due to foreign currency translation and in domestic markets 10 growth the success of customer products for the treatment of diabetes and oncology as well as various dental applications led to increased sales of component parts for both prefillable injection systems pharmaceutical packaging and nonfilled syringes disposable medical components in europe the increased sales volumes in europe were made possible by plant expansions in germany and france that started to come online in the fourth quarter of 2002 overall price increases accounted for 16 of the sales increase over 2002 

gross profit 

although 2004 sales volumes improved 582 million over the prior year gross profit improved by only 25 million over 2003 levels the consolidated gross margin declined by three basis points to 29 in 2004 versus 32 in 2003 the majority of the decrease in the gross margin is associated with costs incurred in implementing the company’s interim production strategies following the january 2003 explosion at the company’s production facility in kinston north carolina during 2003 these costs totaled 98 million but were completely offset by business interruption insurance reimbursements as a result of the final insurance settlement recorded at the end of 2003 no additional insurance coverage was available for costs incurred in subsequent periods in 2004 similar costs totaling 116 million were incurred resulting in a 21 percentage point decrease in gross margin during 2004 the company completed the construction of molding operations at a new facility in kinston and by the fourth quarter of 2004 the majority of the costs associated with the interim production plans had ceased the new plant was operating at 75 of planned capacity at december 31 2004 management expects gross margin to improve to approximately 30 in 2005 as the new plant comes to full utilization but increased depreciation charges and higher oilbased resin and other raw material costs will partially offset the efficiency improvement gains 

selling general and administrative costs 

 in millions 2004 2003 2002  pharmaceutical systems selling and administrative costs 726 655 528 corporate costs general corporate costs 208 184 141 kinston legal expenses 17   restricted stock plan 51   us pension plan expense income 50 64 27 information system project costs  08 34  total selling general and administrative costs 1052 911 676  pharmaceutical systems segment selling and administrative costs in 2004 increased by 71 million over 2003 levels the strength of european currencies versus the us dollar contributed 30 million of the cost increase higher compensation costs including personnel increases in the quality assurance function in north america along with sales and marketing staff increases in the company’s plastic device and south american operations accounted for 30 million of the 2004 increase over 2003 other pharmaceutical systems administrative cost increases in 2004 included 06 million of business development consulting costs and 05 million in audit fee increases associated with sarbanesoxley compliance activities in 2003 pharmaceutical systems selling and administrative costs were 127 million higher than in 2002 with an increase of 90 million mostly due to compensation and headcount increases including higher sales commission bonuses and foreign exchange rate changes of 37 million selling general and administrative costs in the pharmaceutical systems segment were approximately 13 of total net sales in each of the 2004 2003 and 2002 annual periods 

general corporate costs encompass executive officers’ costs board of directors’ compensation and legal compliance finance and communication expenses in 2004 these costs exceeded 2003 levels by 24 million increases in the company’s stock price resulted in a 10 million charge associated with stockbased board of directors’ fees other general corporate cost increases in 2004 included a 08 million increase in legal and patent costs a 05 million increase in fda information system compliance programs and an additional 04 million of sarbanesoxley related audit costs these cost increases were partially offset by lower management incentive compensation costs in 2003 general corporate costs were 43 million above those incurred in 2002 the increase in 2003 general corporate costs over 2002 was led by higher insurance costs of 15 million and stockbased board of directors’ fee increases of 10 million the remaining 2003 over 2002 general corporate cost increases were principally attributed to expenses associated with implementing sarbanesoxley requirements including the newly created position of chief compliance officer increased internal audit staffing and higher incentive bonus awards 

in 2004 the company incurred 17 million in legal costs associated with finalizing regulatory investigations and responding to plaintiffs in three lawsuits filed in connection with the kinston explosion and related fire similar costs in 2003 were reported as part of the insurance settlement line of the income statement 

during 2004 the company awarded 378900 shares of performance vesting restricted shares to key employees under the 2004 stockbased compensation plan the shares vest over three performance periods a maximum of 129232 shares were eligible to vest according to 2004 annual results a maximum of 124834 shares could vest according to the combined 2004 and 2005 results and a maximum of 124834 shares could vest according to the results achieved over the threeyear period ending december 31 2006 the ultimate amount of shares that will vest is determined by the achievement of certain performance targets involving annual growth rates on revenue and return on invested capital for the performance periods ending in 2005 and 2006 additional shares may be granted if the performance levels exceed certain targets as the ultimate number of shares that will be awarded will not be known until the end of these performance periods the plan is accounted for as a variable award plan and compensation expense is recognized over the performance periods based on an estimate of the number of shares that will vest taking into account the performance criteria and the market price of the stock at the end of each period until the final award is determined based upon the performance targets achieved in 2004 and management’s estimate of the results expected for the awards earned over the two and threeyear performance periods ending in 2005 and 2006 the company recognized a charge of 51 million in 2004 of the 129232 shares eligible to vest in 2004 117782 shares vested and 11450 shares expired according to the performance levels achieved for the year 

the recovery of the us stock market in 2003 and its continued positive performance in 2004 has increased the value of the company’s pension plan assets resulting in greater investment income in the pension plan and a 14 million decrease in us pension plan expenses in 2004 in 2005 us pension plan expenses are expected to remain approximately even with 2004 levels as the favorable impact of higher asset values and investment returns will be offset by higher benefit obligation liabilities resulting from the decrease in the discount rate 575 at december 31 2004 versus 600 at december 31 2003 used to measure plan liabilities 

during 2003 the company completed the implementation of a new financial consolidation system and finalized several electronic billing and website improvement projects initiated in 2002 in 2005 the company will begin a project to upgrade cash disbursement general ledger and other production control systems in north america management estimates incremental project expenses of 12 million in 2005 with additional related capital spending of 48 million

on january 29 2003 the company’s kinston nc plant suffered an explosion and related fire that resulted in six deaths a number of injured personnel and substantial damage to the building machinery and equipment and raw material inventories the company’s property and business interruption coverage with its principal insurer provided for a maximum insurance recovery of 66 million the company and its insurer reached a consensus that the total losses for business interruption insured incremental costs and property replacement would exceed the maximum recoverable amount resulting in the final settlement of the insurance claim for the full 66 million reimbursement the final accounting for the insurance settlement and related costs is presented below 

 in millions 2003  insurance coverage reimbursement  660  costs and expenses business interruption costs 98 insured incremental costs 158 book value of property and equipment 117 uninsured legal and investigation costs 114  total costs and expenses 487  gain on insurance settlement net of related costs 173  restructuring charges 

during 2004 the company finalized the closure of a plastic device manufacturing plant in the uk the plant operations utilized leased facilities with lease terms ending in 2010 in connection with the exit from the plant the company recorded 10 million of restructuring charges in 2004 principally consisting of the excess of future lease costs over expected sublease rental income as well as additional severance expense and repair costs necessary to return the leased facility to its original condition 

in december 2003 the company recorded a 70 million charge associated with the planned closure of the plastic device manufacturing plant located in the uk referred to above the decision to close the plant followed a decision by a marketing and distribution partner for the company’s customer to terminate its involvement with the principal product produced by the facility accordingly the company recorded a 60 million impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value and the expected fair value of the equipment at this site a related charge of 10 million was also recorded for statutory postemployment benefit costs deemed probable of being paid 

other expense income 

other expense income was 15 million 06 million and 16 million for years 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively in 2004 the majority of the expense related to losses on surplus equipment sales and asset impairment adjustments the 2003 expense principally represents foreign currency transaction losses as a result of the devaluation of the argentine peso the company’s subsidiary in argentina recorded a foreign exchange gain of 17 million on assets denominated in nonpeso currencies in 2002 

interest expense net 

the following table summarizes the company’s net interest expense for the threeyear period ended december 31 2004 

 in millions 2004 2003 2002  interest expense  98  104  113 capitalized interest 13 07 07 interest income 15 22 11  interest expense net 70 75 95  net interest expense declined 05 million in 2004 compared to 2003 results largely as a result of lower average debt levels and an increase in capitalized interest associated with the kinston construction project in 2003 net interest expense declined 20 million from 2002 levels the majority of the 2003 decrease was due to interest income generated from advances made to customers in connection with tooling and mold design projects the remaining decrease in 2003 net interest expense was attributed to lower interest rates as average debt levels remained essentially constant with those of 2002 

income taxes 

the effective tax rate on consolidated income from continuing operations was 270 in 2004 360 in 2003 and 289 in 2002 

the 2004 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by a change in french tax law extending the life of net operating loss carryforwards the use of us foreign tax credits that were previously expected to expire unutilized and the favorable resolution of several prior year tax issues the combined impact of these items offset partially by the nondeductible restructuring charge resulted in a 45 reduction in the 2004 effective tax rate the 2003 effective tax rate was unfavorably affected by the impairment charge in the uk which did not result in a tax benefit as management did not expect to generate future taxable income in the specific uk legal entity sufficient to utilize net operating loss carryforwards additionally management provided a 05 million valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset connected with this location that was unlikely to be realized these items increased the 2003 effective tax rate by 37 the 2002 effective tax rate was favorably affected by a 24 million tax benefit realized upon the change in a us tax law related to loss disallowance rules partially offset by the tax impact of a foreign exchange gain in argentina and a nondeductible restructuring charge related to the impairment of a technology investment resulting in a 40 decrease to the 2002 effective tax rate 

equity in affiliates 

the contribution to earnings from a 25 ownership interest in daikyo seiko ltd in japan and a 49 ownership interest in three companies in mexico was income of 34 million in 2004 income of 16 million in 2003 and a loss of 03 million in 2002 the 2004 results from daikyo improved by 10 million over 2003 reflecting a combination of improved sales results a nonrecurr ing investment gain a decrease in income tax rates and the continuing strength of the japanese yen versus the us dollar daikyo’s improved sales results were favorably affected by orders from customers in advance of raw material changes initiated by suppliers of coating materials and by increased sales of prefillable syringes using resin cz® plastics resin cz® is a registered trademark of daikyo seiko ltd the 2004 results of the mexican affiliates improved by 08 million over 2003 levels including a 06 million gain on the sale of real estate equity earnings in 2003 were 19 million above 2002 levels reflecting a strong sales year for daikyo and breakeven results for the mexican affiliates following losses in 2002 associated with the restructuring of plant operations 

company purchases from all affiliates totaled approximately 286 million in 2004 184 million in 2003 and 115 million in 2002 the majority of which relates to a distributorship agreement allowing the company to purchase and resell daikyo products sales to affiliates were 06 million 07 million and 10 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively

the pretax loss from discontinued drug delivery and clinical services operations was 135 million 175 million and 157 million for each of the years 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the 2002 results include 07 million of costs associated with the former contract manufacturing and consumer healthcare units 

in 2002 the company also recorded a 59 million or 020 per share tax benefit in discontinued operations connected with the 2001 disposition of the contract manufacturing and packaging business this tax benefit and related refund resulted from a change in us tax law in 2002 related to loss disallowance rules 

financial condition liquidity and capital resources 

the collection of insurance receivables and strong cash flow from operations led to a 310 million increase in the cash balance at december 31 2004 compared to 2003 accounts receivable and inventory turnover ratios remained consistent with prior year results working capital totaled 1100 million and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 19 to 1 at december 31 2004 

consolidated debt was 1608 million at december 31 2004 debt to total invested capital total debt and shareholders’ equity was 348 at december 31 2004 a 57 percentage point improvement over yearend 2003 with shareholders’ equity benefiting from additional capital provided by stock option exercises and from favorable currency translation on nonus dollar net assets 

cash flows generated from operations totaled 810 million in 2004 compared to 837 million in 2003 the company’s european and asian business units continued to provide strong cash flow results offsetting declining results in the americas’ region which were affected by increased costs related to kinston interim production programs and startup costs at the new plant other operating cash flows include 92 million of insurance collections received in 2004 that helped offset the payment of liabilities related to the 2003 kinston accident 

capital spending for 2004 totaled 574 million the construction of the new kinston molding operation accounted for 131 million of the 2004 capital spent other major capital projects included the expansion of the stolberg germany metal and plastics facility 51 million and additional manufacturing capacity for the westar® product line at the jersey shore pa plant 24 million the remaining capital spending consists of efficiency safety and infrastructure improvements 116 million new manufacturing equipment purchases 115 million additional new product and expansion projects 73 million plastic and rubber tooling projects 34 million and information system upgrades 30 million the company anticipates that total 2005 capital spending will be approximately 500 million of which 60 is scheduled to be used for new equipment efficiency safety and infrastructure improvements and tooling projects 27 for new product and expansion projects and the remainder for information technology systems and equipment 

cash provided by investing activities in 2004 includes 318 million of insurance proceeds related to the kinston accident which helped to fund construction of the new facility other investing cash flows included 05 million of proceeds received on miscellaneous equipment sales and a 06 million payment from the company’s affiliate in mexico in partial satisfaction of a note receivable 

financing cash flows include proceeds from stock option exercises of 135 million and dividends paid to shareholders totaling 128 million 0425 per share the board of directors intends to continue the practice of declaring dividends following its quarterly review of the company’s financial condition management expects that cash flows from continuing operations net of capital spending requirements will provide sufficient funding for the current dividend policy 

the following table summarizes the company’s contractual obligations at december 31 2004 and the effect the obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods

the company has letters of credit totaling 40 million supporting the reimbursement of workers’ compensation and other claims paid on west’s behalf by insurance carriers the company’s accrual for insurance obligations was 34 million at december 31 2004 

on may 17 2004 the company replaced its existing revolving credit facility the new agreement involving a group of six banks provides a 1250 million committed revolving credit facility through january 5 2009 financing costs on the new credit facility of 05 million were deferred and are being amortized over the life of the agreement under the new agreement the company’s leverage ratio the ratio of total debt less cash to consolidated capitalization may not exceed 50 and its consolidated net worth shareholders equity excluding cumulative translation adjustments must be at least 1989 million plus half of any net income after taxes earned after december 31 2003 as of december 31 2004 the company’s leverage ratio was 249 its consolidated net worth stood at 2583 million and the company was in compliance with all debt covenants failure to meet these or other debt covenants would cause all borrowings under the revolving credit facility as well as 1000 million of senior notes to become immediately due and payable and may trigger early payment penalties 

interest costs on notes drawn under the revolving credit facility are primarily based on london interbank offering rates plus an applicable margin ranging from 070 to 120 dependent on the company’s leverage ratio in addition the company must pay an annual facility fee ranging from 0175 to 030 during the commitment period as determined by the leverage ratio as of december 31 2004 the company had borrowed 508 million under the revolving credit facility 

the company believes that its financial condition current capitalization and expected income from operations will be sufficient to meet the company’s future expected cash requirements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

management’s discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions some of which are subjective and complex that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements management believes the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating the results of operations and financial position of the company 

revenue recognition sales of manufactured components are recorded at the time title and risk of loss passes to the customer some customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes management records rebate costs based on its assessment of the likelihood that these volumes will be attained the company also establishes product return liabilities for customer quality claims when such amounts are deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated revenue associated with tooling and other engineering service agreements is recognized as services are performed in relation to management’s estimate of the total costs to be incurred on the agreement for agreements with multiple deliverables the company assesses whether more than one unit of accounting exists if more than one unit exists revenue for each separate unit is recorded as earned 

impairment of assets the company reviews goodwill and longlived assets principally property plant and equipment and patents annually and whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment as part of the reporting unit to which it belongs the company has determined its reporting units to be the americas europeasia and device group divisions of the pharmaceutical systems segment for assets held and used in the business management estimates the future cash flows to be derived from the related asset or business unit for assets held for sale management determines fair value by estimating the anticipated proceeds to be received upon the sale of the asset less costs to sell changes in management’s estimate of fair value including management’s estimate of future cash flows could have a material impact on the company’s future results of operations and financial position 

employee benefits the measurement of the obligations under the company’s defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plans are subject to a number of assumptions these include the rate of return on plan assets and the rate at which the future obligations are discounted to present value for us plans which account for over 90 of global plan assets the longterm rate of return assumption remained at 90 this return assumption was determined by reviewing the expected mix of plan assets approximately 65 equity and 35 debt securities and the projected return over a 10year period the discount rate was reduced 25 basis points to 575 on december 31 2004 to reflect current market conditions changes in these estimates including the market performance of plan assets and other actuarial assumptions could have a material impact on the company’s future results of operations and financial position every 25 basis point reduction in the longterm rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by approximately 04 million a 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately 06 million in addition restructuring events such as plant closures or changes in pension plan provisions could result in curtailment or settlement of pension plan obligations which would result in gain or loss recognition in the period when such an event occurs 

stockbased compensation the company currently accounts for employee stock options and other stockbased compensation under the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” according to the intrinsic value method compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess if any of the quoted market price of the stock at the date of the option grant over the exercise price the company has not recorded any compensation cost for stock options as the grants were made at 100 of the fair market value of the stock at the grant date as permitted under statement of financial accounting standard 123 “sharebased payment” fas 123 the company discloses the impact of applying a fair value approach to measure stock option expense in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included within item 8 of this report 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board revised fas 123 the revised statement prohibits the use of the intrinsic value method and requires the use of a fairvalue based measurement method in accounting for sharebased payment transactions with employees the requirements of the revised fas 123 standard are mandatory for interim reporting periods beginning after june 15 2005 the company plans to adopt the statement early on january 1 2005 using the modified prospective method under this method stockbased employee compensation cost will be recognized for all new awards granted after january 1 2005 additionally compensation costs for unvested stock options and awards that are outstanding at january 1 2005 will be recognized over the requisite service period based on the grantdate fair value of those options and awards as previously calculated under the proforma disclosures under fas 123 management expects the compensation expense associated with stock options and employee stock purchase programs to impact full year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by approximately 03 – 05 per share in 2005 

income taxes the company estimates income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation in addition deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established to recognize differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of the company’s assets and liabilities valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized the recoverability of tax assets is subject to the company’s estimates of future profitability generally at the local subsidiary company and country level changes in tax legislation business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined 

in october 2004 the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “act” was signed into law the act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations the deduction is subject to a number of limitations on march 5 2005 the company’s board of directors approved a plan to repatriate up to 70 million representing existing cash balances at qualified controlled foreign corporations the repatriated funds will principally be used to pay down existing domestic debt the company will be required to allocate tax expense to repatriating distributions under the act in its 2005 quarterly and annual financial statements the act ’s 85 percent exclusion of qualifying dividends reduces the 35 us federal statutory rate to 525 of distributions however the determination of allocable expense to distributions will depend on among other things the companys affirmative elections to apply the special tax law to each distribution the 2005 actual earnings and tax expense of each distributing entity and of the us parent company the companys ability to credit foreign taxes against the resulting federal tax the effect of us state taxes on the distribution and the reversal of provisions for deferred taxes on certain unremitted earnings of prior periods the company currently estimates that its first quarter 2005 tax expense allocable to the distribution resulting from the march 2005 board of directors’ action will be between 2 million and 4 million or between 006 and 013 per diluted share the company expects to be in a position to finalize its assessment of possible additional amounts to be remitted under the act by december 31 2005

pharmaceutical closures and components


the company is one of the worlds largest manufacturers of rubber and
elastomeric closures and components for sealing injectable drug vials prefilled
syringes and other pharmaceutical containers this ranking is supported by
primary market research and the companys own market resources the company
offers several hundred proprietary natural rubber and synthetic elastomer
formulations which are molded into closures and components in a variety of
sizes shapes and colors the closures and components are used for containers
holding serums vaccines antibiotics anesthetics intravenous solutions and
other drugs and solutions they are designed and manufactured to assure the
integrity of these solutions throughout the products approved shelf life

page

many elastomer component formulations are specially designed to be compatible
with a given drug formulation so that the drug will remain safe and effective
during storage new elastomeric components must be tested with each drug
solution to show that ingredients do not leach into the customers product or
adversely affect the drugs safety and effectiveness

rubber closures and components are usually washed sterilized and subjected to
other preuse processes by the customer or a third party before they are fitted
on the filled container the company has introduced a valueadded line of
closures and components that are prewashed packaged and ready to be
sterilized eliminating several steps in customers incoming processes the
company is also developing a line of presterilized closures and components that
can be introduced directly into customers sterile drugfilling operations

a growing portion of the companys closure and components business involves
elastomeric and plastic components for empty and prefilled disposable syringes
such as plungers tip caps and needle covers the company also offers
bloodcollection system components including vacuum tube stoppers and needle
valves and a number of specialized elastomeric and plastic components for
bloodanalyzing systems and other medical devices

metal seals


the company offers a broad line of aluminum seals which are crimped onto glass
or plastic pharmaceutical vials and containers to hold the rubber stoppers
securely in place the top of the aluminum seals often contain tamperevident
tabs or flipoff r plastic covers which must be removed before the drug can
be withdrawn the seals and flipoff covers are sold in a variety of sizes
shapes and colors to enable customers to differentiate and distinguish their
drug solutions the company has introduced an improved version of its flipoff
covers that helps the customer protect against counterfeiting of injectable drug
products and maintains better control and integrity of inprocess filled vials
prior to final labeling

some aluminum seals are sold with specially formulated rubber or elastomeric
discs prefitted inside the seal these lined seals may be placed directly
onto the pharmaceutical container thus eliminating the need for a separate
stopper in recent years the company has expanded capacity and upgraded
production processes for metal seal manufacturing clearly bringing the
facilities to stateoftheart capability

device group


in 2003 the company formed the device group an operating segment within the
pharmaceutical systems reporting segment to strengthen its global strategic
approach to market opportunities outside of the traditional injectable drug
delivery systems business with design tooling and manufacturing centers in
north america and europe the device group applies the companys expertise in
product design precision injection molding and assembly for manufacturing
sophisticated delivery devices and dispensing systems with a focus on
multiplepiece closures that require highspeed assembly this groups product
portfolio includes plastic contraceptive drug packages childresistant and
tamperevident plastic closures plastic systems used for lyophilized drug
reconstitution and delivery which are molded and fabricated in a clean room
environment plastic containers bottles and closures for the consumer medical
device and diagnostic markets and closures for food and beverage processors

analytical laboratory services


the companys laboratories conduct tests to determine the compatibility of its
rubber components with customers drugs and in the united states file
formulation and process information with the food and drug administration
fda which is used in support of customers drug applications the
analytical laboratories provide specialized testing for drug delivery systems
and container closure components for customers on a contract basis

product development


the company maintains its own laboratories for testing raw materials and
finished goods to assure conformity to customer specifications and to safeguard
product quality laboratory facilities are also used for development of new
products engineering is responsible for product and tooling design and testing
and for the design and construction of processing equipment in addition a
corporate product development department develops new packaging and device
concepts in 2003 56 professional employees were engaged in these activities
development and engineering expenditures for the creation and application of new
and improved device products and manufacturing processes were 64 million in
2003 54 million in 2002 and 48 million in 2001

                          drug delivery systems segment
                          

drug delivery business unit


the drug delivery business unit engages in both independent and clientfunded
research to develop products using drug delivery technologies patenting these
where possible and subject to any rights granted or ceded in connection with
client funding retains the rights to exploit the patented technology the
company has patents or patent applications covering a range of delivery
technologies for various routes of administration including nasal oral and
parenteral and products that incorporate these technologies it seeks to
license internally developed products to pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies as well as work with these companies to enhance their drug products
through the application of the companys technologies the company will also
develop generic versions of drug products and then seek development and
marketing partners or licensees for the resulting products the company also
maintains laboratory capabilities that support client and internal development
projects research and development expenditures for the drug delivery business
unit were 123 million in 2003 110 million in 2002 and 82 million in 2001

the drug delivery business unit is focusing the majority of its efforts on
developing products using its two key nasal delivery technologies the first is
chisystrademark a proprietary chitosanbased technology chitosan a highly
purified polysaccharide acts as a bioadhesive excipient that increases the
residence time of drugs on mucosal surfaces and may improve bioavailability
chisys can be formulated as a liquid or powder the second nasal technology is
based on proprietary pectin formulations that form gels in the nasal cavity
pectin a linear polysaccharide found in fruits and vegetables is widely used
in food and nutritional products these pectin formulations allow the company to
attenuate the absorption profile of certain drugs in order to reduce peak
concentrations and extend delivery times

the company is also developing orally delivered products using its
targittrademark system a proprietary technology for drug release within the
lower gastrointestinal tract advantages of targeted colonic delivery are its
localized disease treatment for conditions such as ulcerative colitis and
crohns disease inflammatory bowel disease and its ability to deliver
molecules sensitive to low ph or enzyme action

page

the targittrademark technology is based on the application of a combination of
enteric polymer coatings onto starch capsules the choice and thickness of the
coating determines the site of release as targeting is based on both ph and
time the capsule can accommodate relatively large doses and can be filled with
a wide range of formulations  powders granules tablets minitablets coated
pellets semisolids or hightemperature liquid melts the targittrademark
technology can be combined with several formulation approaches such as
absorption enhancement or controlled release to provide sustained release
characteristics

as an extension of the companys drug delivery and formulation expertise the
drug delivery business unit has been developing a generic version of a
commercially available nasal product the company is in latestage discussions
with a potential licensing partner for the exclusive rights to market sell and
distribute the product when approved by the fda

the following chart identifies products that incorporate the chisys pectin and
targit technologies the products development stage and licensing status

clinical services


in april 1999 the company acquired the clinical services division gfi of
collaborative clinical research inc an 80bed clinical trials research
facility in evansville indiana gfi operates as a business unit within the drug
delivery systems reporting segment gfi employs a staff of 88 people including
nurses medical technicians and other support staff

gfi performs human clinical trials for pharmaceutical and biologic medical
device and consumer health products which are conducted on behalf of sponsor
applicants seeking marketing approval or postmarketing support for their
products in the pharmaceutical and biologic arena gfi conducts primarily phase
i and ii clinical trials with capabilities available to support later phases of
the drug development process in addition to performing clinical trials limited
contract research services such as protocol writing case report form design and
various aspects of early phase project management are at times provided to
clients
page

in conducting the trials gfi contracts with licensed physicians who oversee the
administration of individual trials in addition an independent institutional
review board that includes medical and nonmedical personnel is charged with
protecting the safety of study subjects provides review of both study protocols
and trial administration

the company may be subject to claims arising from the personal injury or death
of persons participating in clinical trials the company believes that these
risks are mitigated by the following the oversight of the institutional review
board malpractice insurance coverage that is required to be carried by the
physicians who perform the studies contractual indemnification of the site by
the trial sponsors and the fact that all study subjects are required to sign an
informed consent prior to their participation finally government regulations
place shared responsibility for proper study conduct and the protection of study
subjects onto the principal investigator the institutional review board and the
trial site

                              government regulation
                              

the fda extensively regulates the research development testing manufacture
labeling promotion advertising distribution and marketing of drugs in the
united states under the food drug and cosmetic act the companys businesses
are involved in a number of activities regulated by the fda and by comparable
regulatory agencies in other countries

the companys drug packaging components including stoppers seals and syringe
plungers are used to package drug products that are regulated by the fda to
accommodate the needs of its customers which manufacture drug products the
company must maintain detailed written procedures for the receipt
identification storage handling sampling testing and approval or rejection
of its products before shipment samples from each lot of components must be
tested for conformance with applicable specifications manufacturing facilities
must establish and conform to written procedures for production and process
controls and must create and retain records for a specified period of time

the companys contract laboratory which performs certain services for drug
manufacturers is subject to the fdas current good manufacturing practices
cgmp regulations it must also register as a contract laboratory with the
fda and is subject to periodic inspections by the fda the drug enforcement
administration has licensed the contract laboratory to handle and store
controlled substances

the fda regulates the work of gfi in certain clinical trials gfi must comply
with the fdas regulations applicable to activities a sponsor of certain trials
delegates to it such as recruitment of study subjects documentation of the
study and conducting the trial

to be approved for marketing in the united states drugs must undergo an
extensive development and approval process designed to ensure that only those
products proven to be safe and effective are made available to the public as
part of that process applicants seeking approval must conduct through
hospitals and other clinical research facilities a series of clinical tests of
the drug on humans these clinical trials involve the administration or use of a
drug in progressively larger populations of human volunteers and in some cases
over long periods of time and in higher doses human clinical trials are a
critical component of the drug development process as the fdas ultimate
approval for marketing of an applicants drug will depend in large measure on
the data and information obtained during the clinical trial work

page

clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases but the
phases may overlap or be combined phase i usually involves the initial
introduction of the investigational drug into people to evaluate its safety
dosage tolerance pharmacodynamics and if possible to gain an early
indication of its effectiveness phase ii usually involves trials in a limited
patient population to evaluate the appropriate dosage and dosage tolerance
identify possible adverse effects and safety risks and preliminarily evaluate
the efficacy of the drug for specific indications phase iii trials usually
further evaluate clinical efficacy and test further for safety by using the drug
in its final form in an expanded patient population the fda sometimes requires
phase iv studies to be conducted after a drug has been approved for marketing
these studies are used to monitor the longterm risks and benefits of a
particular drug to study the effect of alternative dosage levels or to
evaluate the safety and efficacy of a drug in targeted patient populations

                                  order backlog
                                  

at december 31 2003 the pharmaceutical systems reporting segment order backlog
was 1316 million of which 1310 million is expected to be filled during
fiscal year 2004 compared with 1188 million at the end of 2002 order backlog
in this segment includes firm orders placed by customers for manufacture over a
period of time according to a customers schedule or upon confirmation by the
customer the company also has contractual arrangements with a number of its
customers and products covered by these contracts are included in the companys
backlog only as orders are received from those customers

drug delivery systems reporting segment backlog which is primarily related to
the clinical services business unit consists of signed contracts yet to be
completed contracts included in backlog are subject to termination or delay at
any time and therefore the backlog is not necessarily a meaningful predictor of
future results delayed contracts remain in the companys backlog until
cancelled as of december 31 2003 the drug delivery systems reporting segment
backlog was 38 million of which 34 million is expected to be filled during
fiscal year 2004 at december 31 2002 the backlog was 13 million

                                  raw materials
                                  

the company uses three basic raw materials in the manufacture of its
pharmaceutical systems products elastomers aluminum and plastic the company
has access to adequate supplies of raw materials to meet its production needs
and therefore foresees no significant availability problems in the near future

the company is pursuing a supply chain management strategy in its pharmaceutical
systems reporting segment which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers
that control their own sources of supply this strategy has reduced the number
of raw material suppliers used by the company in most cases the company will
purchase raw materials from a single source to assure quality and reduce costs
due to regulatory control over our production processes and the cost and time
involved in qualifying suppliers the company relies on single source suppliers
for many critical raw materials this strategy increases the risks that the
companys supply lines may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production
problem these risks are managed by selecting suppliers with multiple
manufacturing sites rigid quality control systems surplus inventory levels and
other methods of maintaining supply in case of interruption in production

the company uses two main raw materials in its drug delivery business unit
chitosan and pectin the company purchases highly purified chitosan from a
single source as there are limited vendors that provide the material the
company mitigates the risk of supply interruption by maintaining enough chitosan
in its inventory to meet demand for the foreseeable future although the company
currently purchases pectin from one vendor there are various vendors that
provide the material and therefore the company believes there is little risk of
supply interruption

                   patents trademarks and proprietary rights
                   

it is the companys policy to maintain a strong patent position by obtaining
patent protection on products and processes deemed to possess potential
commercial significance this policy applies to patents resulting from the
efforts of the companys research and engineering staff or through the research
and development of others financed by the company as a general rule however
the company does not seek patent protection on its rubber and elastomer
formulations which it regards as trade secrets the company also relies upon
trademarks knowhow continuing technological innovations and licensing
opportunities to maintain and further develop its competitive position

employees and consultants outside scientific collaborators sponsored
researchers and other advisors who receive confidential information are required
to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or
consulting relationships the agreements provide that all inventions by an
employee shall be the companys property

the companys patents trademarks and proprietary rights that relate to the
pharmaceutical systems reporting segment have been useful in establishing the
companys market share and in the growth of the companys business and are
expected to continue to be of value in the future as the company continues to
develop its proprietary products in this segment although of importance in the
aggregate the company does not consider its current pharmaceutical systems
segment business or its earnings to be materially dependent on any single
patent trademark or proprietary right

the companys drug delivery reporting segment has developed and maintained a
significant portfolio of patents pending patent applications and related
proprietary rights for inventions relating to drug delivery systems technologies
and products developed at its nottingham england and lionville pennsylvania
research facilities while this portfolio has not produced significant revenues
for the company in the past year it is expected to be of major value to this
segment going forward particularly in the areas of attracting and developing
strategic alliances with ethical drug manufacturers and biotechnology and
medical device companies seeking proprietary systems for delivery of their
products and then developing selling and licensing the companys proprietary
systems for use with the products of these manufacturers as well as licensing
proprietary products taken through early stage development at the company

                           markets and major customers
                           

the companys pharmaceutical systems reporting segment provides components
andor contract services to major pharmaceutical biotechnology and hospital
supplymedical device companies products and services are distributed primarily
through the companys own sales force with nominal use of regional
distributors the companys drug delivery reporting segment also works with
pharmaceutical and biotech customers primarily in the united states and europe
in developing products using its drug delivery technologies and provides
clinical research to full service contract research organizations in the united
states

becton dickinson and company bd accounted for approximately 12 of the
companys 2003 consolidated net sales the principal products sold to bd are
synthetic rubber natural rubber metal and plastic components used in bds
disposable and prefilled syringes and blood sampling and analysis systems the
company expects to continue to be a major bd supplier

excluding bd the next ten largest customers accounted for approximately 31 of
the companys consolidated net sales in 2003 but not one of these customers
accounted for more than 4 of 2003 consolidated net sales

                                   competition
                                   

the company competes with several companies some of which are larger than the
company across its major pharmaceutical systems product lines in addition
many companies worldwide compete with the company for business related to
specific product lines however the company believes that it supplies a major
portion of the us market requirements for pharmaceutical elastomer and metal
packaging components and also has a significant share of the european market for
these components

because of the special nature of these products competition is based primarily
on product design and performance although total cost is becoming increasingly
important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive cost control
programs across their entire operations competitors often compete on the basis
of price the company differentiates itself from its competition as a
fullservice value added supplier that is able to provide presale
compatibility studies and other services and sophisticated postsale technical
support on a global basis

the company competes against numerous competitors in the field of plastic
closures for consumer products many of these competitors are larger than the
company and command significant market shares the company differentiates itself
through its expertise in highspeed assembly of multiplepiece closure systems

the clinical research industry is highly fragmented and comprised of several
large and many small fullservice contract research organizations as well as
limited service providers other major competitors in the industry also include
the research departments and owned clinical research units of pharmaceutical
companies

the drug delivery business unit competes in the united states europe and
elsewhere with pharmaceutical biotechnology and drug delivery companies
hospitals universities research organizations individual scientists and
nonprofit organizations engaged in the development of alternative drug delivery
systems and products or new drug research and testing as well as with entities
already producing and marketing drugs the biopharmaceutical industry is subject
to rapid and substantial technological change competition is intense and based
substantially on scientific and technological factors these factors include the
availability of patents and other intellectual property the ability to
commercialize technological developments and the ability to obtain governmental
approval for testing manufacturing and marketing

the companys chisystrademark and pectinbased nasal technologies and
targittrademark oral technologies along with other technologies and products
based on these technologies provide certain important competitive advantages
and are protected by patents however new drugs or developments in alternative
drug delivery methods may provide greater therapeutic benefits or comparable
benefits at a lower cost there are a number of companies currently seeking to
develop new drug delivery technologies and products including oral intranasal
transdermal buccal or mouth cavity and colonic absorption systems many of
these companies have greater research and development capabilities experience
manufacturing marketing financial and managerial resources than the company
has committed to the drug delivery business unit many of these companies also
have exclusive license or codevelopment arrangements with market leaders for
certain products accordingly there can be no assurance that competitors will
not introduce products or processes competitive with or superior to those of the
company that could render our technologies and products less competitive or
obsolete

in december 2003 the company recorded a 70 million charge associated with a
product designed by a customer and intended for production at our plastics
device plant in the united kingdom as a result of delays connected with the
regulatory approval of the product the marketing and distribution partner for
our customer terminated its involvement with the product the operating results
of the uk plant are significantly dependent on the success and timing of this

to shareholders



item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk
          

the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange
rates and interest rates the following describes the nature of these risks all
debt securities and derivative instruments are considered nontrading

foreign currency exchange risk


the company has subsidiaries outside the united states accounting for
approximately 50 of consolidated net sales virtually all of these sales and
related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and
translated into us dollars although the majority of the assets and
liabilities of these subsidiaries are in the local currency of the subsidiary
and are therefore translated into us dollars the foreign subsidiaries may
hold assets or liabilities not denominated in their local currency these items
may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains and losses as a result the
companys results of operations and financial position are exposed to changing
exchange rates the company periodically uses forward contracts to hedge certain
transactions or to neutralize monthend balance sheet exposures on cross
currency intercompany loans the company has a number of small forward contracts
totaling 100000 as of december 31 2003 to purchase various currencies in
europe and asia in order to minimize the effect of foreign currency
fluctuations the company attempts to pass foreign currency costs on to
customers through price increases

interest rate risk


as a result of its normal borrowing activities the company is exposed to
fluctuations in interest rates which the company manages primarily through its
financing activities the company has short and long term debt with both fixed
and variable interest rates shortterm debt is primarily comprised of notes
payable to banks under lines of credit at variable interest rates longterm
debt consists of 100000000 in senior notes at a fixed rate of interest and
revolving credit facilities at variable rates

pharmaceutical stoppers

the  company  is  one  of  the  worlds  largest  manufacturers  of  rubber  and
elastomeric  stoppers for sealing injectable drug vials and other pharmaceutical
containers  a ranking  that is  supported  by primary  market  research and the
companys own market resources  the company offers several hundred  proprietary
natural  rubber and synthetic  elastomer  formulations  which are molded into a
variety of stopper sizes  shapes and colors the stoppers are used in packaging
serums  vaccines  antibiotics  anesthetics  intravenous  solutions and other
drugs and solutions  they are designed and manufactured to assure the integrity
of these solutions throughout the drug products approved shelf life

most stopper  formulations are specially  designed to be compatible with a given
drug formulation so that the drug will remain safe and effective during storage
new  elastomeric  components must be tested with each drug solution to show that
ingredients  do not leach into the  customers  product or adversely  affect the
drugs safety and  effectiveness  the companys  laboratories  conduct tests to
determine the compatibility of its rubber stoppers with customers drugs and in
the united states  file  formulation and process  information with the food and
drug  administration  fda  which is used in support of customers  new drug
applications
page

rubber stoppers are usually washed  sterilized  and subjected to other  preuse
processes  by the customer or a third party before they are fitted on the filled
container  the company has  introduced a valueadded  line of stoppers that are
pharmaceutically prewashed and packaged and ready to be sterilized eliminating
several steps in customers incoming processes the company is also developing a
line of presterilized  stoppers that can be introduced directly into customers
sterile drugfilling operations

metal seals

the company also offers a broad line of aluminum seals in various sizes shapes
and  colors to secure its rubber  stopper  onto the vial and help its  customers
differentiate  and distinguish  its drug  solutions  the seals are crimped onto
glass or plastic pharmaceutical  containers to hold the rubber stoppers securely
in place  the top of the aluminum seals often contains  tamperevident  tabs or
plastic covers  which must be removed before the drug can be withdrawn  during
2002  the  company  introduced  improvements  in its metal  seals that help the
customer protect against counterfeiting of injectible drug products and maintain
better control and integrity of inprocess filled vials prior to final labeling

some aluminum  seals are sold with  specially  formulated  rubber or elastomeric
discs  prefitted  inside the seal  these lined seals may be placed  directly
onto the  pharmaceutical  container  thus  eliminating  the need for a separate
stopper  in recent  years  the  company has  expanded  capacity  and  upgraded
production  processes  for metal seal  manufacturing  clearly  bringing them to
stateoftheart capability

other products

other products for the pharmaceutical industry include

         products used in the packaging of noninjectable  drugs such as rubber
          dropper   bulbs    plastic    contraceptive   drug   packages    and
          childresistant and tamperevident plastic closures

         plastic systems used for lyophilized drug reconstitution and delivery

in 2000


                         drug delivery systems segment
                         

drug delivery

since 1993 the company has been developing  proprietary  drug delivery  systems
for various  drug and  biological  products  for which  alternative  methods and
routes of  administration  might  improve  therapeutic  performance  or the cost
effectiveness of the therapy in furtherance of that effort in 1998 the company
completed the acquisition of danbiosyst uk ltd dbs a research and development
company  located in nottingham  england  dbs was renamed west  pharmaceutical
services  drug delivery  clinical  research  center  ltd  noted as west drug
delivery  herein  in 1999 and its  operations  integrated  with  the  companys
lionville based drug delivery development operation

west drug delivery  engages in both  independent and  clientfunded  research to
develop  unique  delivery  technologies  patenting  these where  possible  and
subject  to any rights  granted  or ceded in  connection  with  client  funding
retains the rights to exploit the patented  technology  west drug  delivery has
patents or patent  applications  covering a range of delivery  technologies  for
various routes of  administration  including nasal  oral and parenteral  west
drug delivery then seeks to license the technologies to pharmaceutical companies
for use in  combination  with  their  drug  products  alternatively  west will
develop  versions of generic drug products  which  incorporate  its proprietary
delivery  technologies  and then seek  development  and  marketing  partners or
licensees  for  the  resulting  products  west  drug  delivery  also  maintains
laboratory  capabilities that support client and internal development  projects
research and development  expenditures for the drug delivery  business unit were
109 million in 2002 78 million in 2001 and 75 million in 2000

in  2002  west  drug  delivery  systems  completed  a phase i trial  for  nasal
calcitonin and continued the  development of proprietary  formulations  based on
the companys  patented  chitosanbased  nasal delivery system  chisystm  the
company also continued  development of the targittm  delivery system  an orally
administered  specially  coated  starch  capsule  designed  to  bypass  normal
digestion  and deliver the drug to the colon for local and systemic  effect  in
addition   the  company  funded  studies  related  to  a  near  term  licensing
opportunity  for a  generic  version  of a  popular  nasally  delivered  allergy
product  the company  anticipates that the development  work in 2002  together
with  increased  focus  on its  chisystm  technology  will  lead to  additional
licensing opportunities in 2003

clinical services

in  april  1999  the  company  acquired  the  clinical   services  division  of
collaborative  clinical research  inc clinical services operates as a business
unit within the drug delivery systems segment  the clinical  services  business
unit consists of an 80bed clinical  trials research  facility known as the gfi
research  center in  evansville  indiana  in addition to performing  clinical
trials limited contract research services such as protocol writing case report
form design and various  aspects of early phase project  management are at times
provided to clients

the gfi research  center  performs  human  clinical  trials for  pharmaceutical
medical device and consumer  health  products  which are conducted on behalf of
applicants seeking marketing approval for their products  in the pharmaceutical
arena  the gfi  research  center  conducts  phase i through  phase iv  clinical
research trials covering a broad range of therapeutic applications

in  conducting  the trials  the gfi research  center  contracts  with  licensed
physicians who oversee the administration of individual trials in addition the
institutional  review board  irb  an  independent  committee  that includes
medical and  nonmedical  personnel  charged with protecting the safety of study
subjects provides review of both study protocols and trial administration  the
gfi  research  center  employs a staff of  approximately  100 people  including
nurses medical technicians and other support staff

the company may be subject to claims  arising from the personal  injury or death
of persons participating in clinical trials the professional malpractice of the
physicians  with whom the  company  has  contracted  or the  actions  of its own
employees in conducting  the trials  the company  believes that these risks are
mitigated  by several  factors  first  physicians  who perform the studies are
required to carry their own  malpractice  insurance  second  review by the irb
helps to ensure the  protection of subjects  enrolled in the trial  third  all
study  subjects  are  required  to sign  an  informed  consent  prior  to  their
participation in a particular study finally  regulations governing the conduct
of  clinical   trials  and  the   protection  of  human  subjects  place  shared
responsibility  for proper study conduct and the  protection  of study  subjects
onto the principal investigator  the irb and the trial site extensive training
programs  are  conducted  at the site  involving  investigators  staff  and irb
members regarding their respective  responsibilities  in the conduct of clinical
research

to further  reduce its  exposure to  liability  the company  typically  obtains
indemnification from the trial sponsors  however the indemnification  excludes
actions by the company such as negligence or  misconduct  and the terms of each
indemnification provision may vary

government regulation

the fda extensively regulates the research  development  testing manufacture
labeling promotion advertising  distribution and marketing of drugs under the
food  drug and cosmetic act the companys  businesses are involved in a number
of activities regulated by the fda

the companys drug packaging components including stoppers seals and syringes
are used to package drug products that are regulated by the fda to  accommodate
the needs of its customers  which  manufacture drug products  the company must
maintain detailed written procedures for the receipt  identification  storage
handling  sampling  testing and approval or rejection of its products  before
shipment  samples from each lot of  components  must be tested for  conformance
with applicable written  requirements  manufacturing  facilities must establish
and conform to written  procedures for production and process  controls and must
create and retain records for a specified period of time

page

the companys  contract  laboratory  which performs  certain  services for drug
manufacturers  is subject to the fdas  current  good  manufacturing  practices
cgmp  regulations  it must also register as a contract  laboratory with the
fda and is subject to  periodic  inspections  by the fda  the drug  enforcement
administration  has  licensed  the  contract  laboratory  to  handle  and  store
controlled substances

the fda  regulates  the work of the gfi  research  center  in  certain  clinical
trials  gfi must comply with the fdas  regulations  applicable to activities a
sponsor  of  certain  trials  delegates  to it  such as  recruitment  of  study
subjects documentation of the study and conducting and monitoring the trial in
addition the fda regulates the conduct and activities of gfis irb

to be  approved  for  marketing  in the united  states  drugs  must  undergo an
extensive  development and approval  process  designed to ensure that only those
products  proven to be safe and effective are made  available to the public  as
part  of  that  process  applicants  seeking  approval  must  conduct  through
hospitals and other clinical research facilities  a series of clinical tests of
the drug on humans these clinical trials involve the administration or use of a
drug in progressively larger populations of human volunteers and in some cases
over long  periods  of time and in higher  doses  human  clinical  trials are a
critical  component  of the  drug  development  process  as the  fdas  ultimate
approval for  marketing of an  applicants  drug will depend in large measure on
the data and information obtained during the clinical trial work

clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational  drug to human
subjects under the supervision of qualified  investigators  clinical trials are
conducted under protocols  detailing the objectives of the study the parameters
to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated
each  protocol must be submitted to the fda as part of the  investigational  new
drug exemption

clinical  trials  typically are conducted in three  sequential  phases  but the
phases may overlap or be  combined  each trial must be reviewed and approved by
the irb before it can begin  phase i usually involves the initial  introduction
of  the  investigational  drug  into  people  to  evaluate  its  safety  dosage
tolerance  pharmacodynamics  and if possible  to gain an early indication of
its  effectiveness  phase ii  usually  involves  trials  in a  limited  patient
population to evaluate the  appropriate  dosage and dosage  tolerance  identify
possible  adverse  effects and safety  risks  and  preliminarily  evaluate  the
efficacy of the drug for specific indications

phase iii trials usually further evaluate clinical efficacy and test further for
safety by using the drug in its final form in an  expanded  patient  population
the fda  sometimes  requires  phase iv studies to be conducted  after a drug has
been  approved for  marketing  these  studies are used to monitor the longterm
risks and  benefits of a  particular  drug  to study the effect of  alternative
dosage  levels  or to  evaluate  the safety and  efficacy of a drug in targeted
patient populations

recent developments

on january 29 2003 an explosion  and fire  occurred at the companys  kinston
nc  plant  six people lost their  lives and many  others were  injured in the
accident which caused substantial damage to the building machinery  equipment
and  inventories  see note 21 subsequent  event of the notes to consolidated
financial  statements  of the 2002 annual report to  shareholders  incorporated

in december 2002 the company sold its consumer healthcare research unit for 20
million to concentrics  research  llc a company formed by the former  employee
management team and bindley capital partners  llc during 2002 but prior to the
sale of the business  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 06
million  as a  result  there was no gain or loss  recorded  on the sale of the
business

in 2001 the company sold all the operating assets of its contract manufacturing
and packaging  business  unit to dpt  lakewood  inc for a sales price of 298
million  consisting  of 280  million in cash and a 18  million  note due in
2003  the sale  resulted in a loss on disposal of 252  million  or 176 per
share

order backlog

at  december  31  2002 the  pharmaceutical  systems segment order backlog  was
approximately 119 million  all of which is expected to be filled during fiscal
year 2003  compared with  approximately  105 million at the end of 2001 order
backlog in this segment includes firm orders placed by customers for manufacture
over a period of time according to a customers schedule or upon confirmation by
the customer the company also has contractual arrangements with a number of its
customers and products covered by these contracts are included in the companys
backlog only as orders are received from those customers

drug  delivery  systems  segment  backlog  which is  primarily  related  to the
clinical  services  business  unit  consists  of  signed  contracts  yet  to be
completed  contracts included in backlog are subject to termination or delay at
any time and therefore the backlog is not necessarily a meaningful  predictor of
future  results  delayed  contracts  remain  in  the  companys  backlog  until
cancelled  as of december 31 2002 the drug delivery  systems  segment backlog
was 13  million  of which 11 million is expected to be filled during fiscal
year 2003 at december 31 2001 the backlog was 20 million

raw materials

the  company  uses  three  basic  raw  materials  in  the   manufacture  of  its
pharmeutical systems products elastomers aluminum and plastic the company has
been receiving  adequate supplies of raw materials to meet its production needs
and it foresees no significant availability problems in the near future

the company is  pursuing a supply  chain  management  strategy  which  involves
purchasing from  integrated  suppliers that control their own sources of supply
this  strategy  has reduced  the number of raw  material  suppliers  used by the
company  in some cases  the company will purchase raw materials  from a single
source to assure  quality and reduce costs  this  strategy  increases the risks
that the companys  supply lines may be  interrupted  in the event of a supplier
production problem these risks are managed by selecting suppliers with multiple
manufacturing sites rigid quality control systems surplus inventory levels and
other methods of maintaining supply in case of interruption in production

patents trademarks and proprietary rights

the  companys  policy is to apply for  patent  protection  for the  technology
inventions and improvements deemed important to the success of its business the
company  also  relies  upon  trademarks  trade  secrets  knowhow  continuing
technological  innovations and licensing  opportunities  to maintain and further
develop its competitive position

page

it is also the  companys  policy to require  that  employees  and  consultants
outside scientific  collaborators  sponsored researchers and other advisors who
receive confidential  information  execute confidentiality  agreements upon the
commencement of employment or consulting  relationships  the agreements provide
that all inventions by an employee shall be the companys property

the companys  patents  trademarks  and  proprietary  rights that relate to the
pharmaceutical  systems segment have been useful in  establishing  the companys
market share and in the growth of the  companys  business  and are expected to
continue  to be of  value in the  future  especially  in view of the  companys
continuing development of its own proprietary products in this segment although
of  importance  in the  aggregate  the company  does not  consider  its current
pharmaceutical  systems  segment  business  or  its  earnings  to be  materially
dependent on any single patent trademark or proprietary right

the  companys  drug delivery  segment has acquired a  significant  portfolio of
patents   pending  patent  applications  and  related  proprietary  rights  for
inventions  relating to drug delivery systems technology  developed primarily at
its  nottingham  england  research  facility  while this  portfolio  has not
produced  significant  tangible  income to the  company in the past year  it is
expected to be of major value to this segment going forward particularly in the
areas of  attracting  and  developing  strategic  alliances  with  ethical  drug
manufacturers  seeking proprietary  systems for delivery of their products  and
then developing selling and licensing the companys proprietary systems for use
with the products of these manufacturers

major customers

the   company   provides   components   andor   contract   services   to  major
pharmaceutical biotechnology and hospital supplymedical device companies many
of which have several divisions with separate purchasing  responsibilities  the
company  also  provides  clinical  research to full  service  contract  research
organizations  the company  distributes  its products  and  services  primarily
through its own sales force but also uses  regional  distributors  in the united
states and in the asiapacific region

becton  dickinson  and company  bd  accounted for  approximately  13 of the
companys 2002  consolidated  net sales  the principal  products sold to bd are
synthetic  rubber  natural  rubber  metal and plastic  components used in bds
disposable and prefilled syringes and blood sampling and analysis devices  the
company expects to continue as a major bd supplier

excluding bd the next ten largest customers  accounted for approximately 31 of
the  companys  consolidated  net  sales in 2002  but no one of these  customers
accounted for more than 4 of 2002 consolidated net sales

competition

the company competes with several  companies  some of which are larger than the
company  across its major  pharmaceutical  systems  product lines in addition
many  companies  worldwide  compete  with the  company for  business  related to
specific product lines  however  the company believes that it supplies a major
portion of the us market  requirements for pharmaceutical  elastomer and metal
packaging components and also has a significant share of the european market for
these components

because of the special nature of these products  competition is based primarily
on product design and performance  although total cost is becoming increasingly
important as  pharmaceutical  companies  continue with  aggressive  cost control
programs across their entire operations  competitors often compete on the basis
of  price  the  company   differentiates  itself  from  its  competition  as  a
fullservice  supplier that is able to provide presale  compatibility studies
and other services and  sophisticated  postsale  technical  support on a global
basis

page

the  company  competes  against  numerous  competitors  in the field of  plastic
closures for consumer  products  many of these  competitors are larger than the
company and command significant market shares the company differentiates itself
through its expertise in highspeed assembly of multiplepiece closure systems

the clinical  research  industry is highly  fragmented  and comprised of several
large fullservice  contract research  organizations cros many small cros and
limited service  providers  the major  competitors in the industry  include the
research departments of pharmaceutical companies

many  companies   provide   proprietary   drug  delivery   technologies  to  the
pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets  however unlike west the majority of
these companies are focused on a single route of drug  administration  and very
few have capabilities  necessary to take drug products through all stages of the
development process and commercial manufacture the three largest companies the
market leaders have multipledelivery technologies but their strong franchises
are  in  oral   controlledrelease   delivery  systems  wests  drug  delivery
technologies  none of which is currently in commercial production  are in less
competitive segments that do not compete with the market leaders

environmental regulations

the company is subject to applicable  federal  state local and foreign health
safety  and  environmental  laws   including  those  governing   discharges  of
pollutants  to air  and  water  the  generation  management  and  disposal  of
hazardous  materials and wastes and the remediation of contaminated  sites some
of  the  companys  manufacturing  facilities  have  been  issued  environmental
permitscertificates   and  have  implemented  controls  to  prevent  or  reduce
discharges  to  air  and  water  these   permitscertificates  are  subject  to
modification  renewal and  revocation by the issuing  authorities  the company
believes  that its  operations  are  currently in material  compliance  with all
environmental laws  regulations and permits  the company believes that ongoing
environmental operating and capital expenditures will not be material

pursuant to  applicable  state  programs  the company is  currently  completing
environmental remediation activities at one current and two former manufacturing
facilities  collectively  the company has reserved 09 million to address the
cost of remediation at these three facilities

at its former  technical  center  facility in  phoenixville  pennsylvania  the
company  has fully  characterized  contaminated  soils and is about to  complete
groundwater  characterization  activities  upon  completion of the  groundwater
characterization  in 2003 the company believes that it will be able to obtain a
release of liability from the commonwealth of pennsylvania

the  company  has  completed  remediation  activities  at  its  former  plastics
manufacturing facility in wayne new jersey remaining work on the site involves
regrading a small area adjacent to the manufacturing  area to comply with state
solid waste  management  regulations  this work is expected to be  completed in
2003 following which final approval is expected

at its  current  operating  plant in st  petersburg  florida  the company has
commenced  remediation  activities  for  contaminated  groundwater  the company
expects  that this project will be  completed  in 2004  subject  thereafter  to
periodic monitoring

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk
         
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency  exchange
rates and interest rates the following describes the nature of these risks all
debt securities and derivative instruments are considered nontrading

foreign currency  exchange risk

the  company  has  subsidiaries   outside  the  united  states   accounting  for
approximately  46 of consolidated  net sales  virtually all of these sales and
related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and
translated  into  us  dollars   although  the  majority  of  the  assets  and
liabilities  of these  subsidiaries  are in the local currency of the subsidiary
and are therefore  translated into us  dollars  the foreign  subsidiaries may
hold assets or liabilities not denominated in their local currency  these items
may give rise to foreign currency  transaction  gains and losses as a result of
the above  the  companys  results of  operations  and  financial  position are
exposed to changing  exchange  rates  the  company  periodically  uses  forward
contracts to hedge certain  transactions  but generally  does not hedge foreign
currency  exposures  in  order to  minimize  the  effect  of  foreign  currency
fluctuations  the  company  attempts  to  pass  foreign  currency  costs  on to
customers through price increases

interest rate risk

as a result of its  normal  borrowing  activities  the  company  is  exposed  to
fluctuations in interest rates  which the company manages primarily through its
financing activities the company has short and long term debt with both fixed
and variable  interest rates  shortterm  debt is primarily  comprised of notes
payable to banks  under lines of credit at variable  interest  rates  longterm
debt  consists  of  100000  in senior  notes at a fixed rate of  interest  and
revolving credit facilities and other notes at variable rates

the  company  also  utilizes  interest  rate  swaps to  minimize  interest  rate
fluctuations  on certain debt obligations  as of december 31 2002 the company
had one interest rate swap  the swap  with a notional  amount of 6950 british
pound sterling  11200  converts variable rate debt to a fixed rate of 72

pharmaceutical stoppers

the company is the worlds largest  independent  manufacturer of rubber stoppers
for sealing injectable drug vials and other pharmaceutical  containers  several
hundred  proprietary  rubber  formulations  are molded from  natural  rubber and
synthetic  elastomers into a variety of stopper sizes  shapes  and colors the
stoppers  are used in  packaging  serums  vaccines  antibiotics  anesthetics
intravenous  solutions  and other drugs and solutions to assure the integrity of
these solutions during the products approved shelf life


page

most stopper  formulations are specially  designed to be compatible with a given
drug so that  the drug  will  remain  safe and  effective  during  storage  new
elastomeric  components  must be tested  with each  drug  solution  to show that
ingredients  do not leach  into the  customers  product  or affect  the  drugs
potency sterility  effectiveness color or clarity the companys laboratories
conduct  tests to  determine  the  compatibility  of its  rubber  stoppers  with
customers drugs and in the united states file formulation  information in its
drug master file with the food and drug  administration in support of customers
new drug applications

processes by the customer or a thirdparty  before they are fitted on the filled
container  the company has  introduced a valueadded  line of stoppers that are
pharmaceutically  prewashed  and ready to be  sterilized  eliminating  several
steps in customers incoming processes the company is also developing a line of

drugfilling operations

metal seals

to hold the rubber  stoppers  securely in place  the top of the aluminum  seals
often  contains  tamperevident  tabs or plastic  covers  which must be removed
before the drug can be withdrawn

some aluminum  seals are sold with  specially  formulated  rubber or elastomeric
discs  prefitted  inside the seal  these lined seals may be placed  directly
onto the  pharmaceutical  container  thus  eliminating  the need for a separate
stopper  in recent  years  the company has upgraded  production  processes for
metal seal manufacturing clearly bringing them to stateoftheart capability

drug delivery

since 1993 the company has been developing  proprietary  drug delivery  systems
for various  drug and  biological  products  for which  alternative  methods and
routes of  administration  might  improve  therapeutic  performance  or the cost
effectiveness of the therapy in furtherance of that effort in 1998 the company
completed the acquisition of danbiosyst uk ltd dbs a research and development
company  located in nottingham  england  dbs was renamed west  pharmaceutical
services  drug  delivery    clinical  research  center  ltd  in 1999  and its
operations   integrated  with  the  companys   lionville  based  drug  delivery
operations  to  form  a  new  operating  segment  drug  delivery  research  and
development

west drug delivery  engages in both  independent and  clientfunded  research to
develop unique  delivery  technologies  patenting  these where  possible  and
subject  to any rights  granted  or ceded in  connection  with  client  funding
retains the rights to exploit the patented  technology  west drug  delivery has
patents or patent  applications  covering a range of delivery  technologies  for
various routes of administration  including nasal oral parenteral pulmonary
rectal and vaginal west drug delivery then seeks to license the technologies to
pharmaceutical  companies  for use in  combination  with  their  drug  products
alternatively west will develop unique versions of generic drug products which
incorporate its proprietary delivery technologies and then seek development and
marketing partners or licensees for the resulting  products  west drug delivery
also  maintains  laboratory   capabilities  that  support  client  and  internal
development  projects  research  and  development  expenditures  for  the  drug
delivery  business unit were 78 million in 2001 75 million in 2000 and 49
million in 1999

in 2001 west drug deliverys efforts were focused on  clientfunded  projects
on the further  development of proprietary  formulations  of the drugs morphine
calcitonin  insulin  flu  vaccine  and  leuprolide  all using the  companys
patented   chitosanbased   nasal  delivery  system  chisystm    and  on  the
development  of a proprietary  formulation  of budesonide a steroid  using the
companys  targitr system  an orally  administered  specially  coated  starch
capsule system  designed to bypass normal  digestion and deliver the drug to the
colon for local and systemic effect  the nasal morphine product was licensed to
a third party for further  development in 2000 and phase ii clinical  trials for
nasal morphine were completed in 2001 the chisystm technology was licensed to a
third party for delivery of a flu vaccine in 2001  phase ii clinical trials for
the nasal flu  vaccine  were also  completed  in 2001  phase i trials for nasal
leuprolide nasal insulin and targetr budesonide were also completed in 2001

clinical services

the  company  entered  into the  clinical  services  market  with its april 1999
acquisition  of  the  clinical  services  division  of  collaborative   clinical
research inc clinical services operates two distinct divisions and performs as
a business  unit within the drug  delivery  systems  segment  the two  business
divisions  which are  described  more fully  below  are a phase  ithroughiv
clinical trial  research  facility the gfi research  center  and a clinical
research  organization  cro that  conducts  marketing  and  clinical  research
studies   for   customers    prescription   drugs   consumer   products   and
overthecounter otc switch projects

wests gfi research center  conducts phase i through phase iv clinical  research
trials and provides other clinical research services including device and actual
use studies at its 80bed unit located in evansville  indiana phase i research
is  substantially  more  demanding  than other phases of the  clinical  research
process  because  healthy  volunteers  must  typically  be  sequestered  for the
duration of the study  phase iiiv studies are frequently more specialized with
respect to  therapeutic  patient  populations  required  the diversity of gfis
service  offering  has aided  the  development  of both  their  recruitment  and
clinical operations capabilities

west consumer  healthcare research wchr is a niche cro serving the biotech and
pharmaceutical  industries  wchr conducts a unique blend of marketing  research
and clinical  research under one roof these services include phase iii phase
iv rxtootc switch work and specialty work in naturalistic  studies  including
label and package insert comprehension consumer selfselection selfdiagnosis
and actual  use  studies  in  addition  wchr  performs  claims  substantiation
studies  experience  trials  volumetric  forecasting  on ind drugs  and other
unique and customized  research solutions that include clinical andor marketing
research  objectives  the  company  has  access  to market  research  sites and
clinical  sites  across  the  united  states  and  utilizes  a  central  medical
operations  group  comprised of nurses and  physicians  for many of its studies

clinical services contracts provide a fixed price for each component or service
delivered  the ultimate  contract value depends on such variables as the number
of research sites selected  the number of patients  enrolled and other services
required by sponsors  these  contracts range in duration from several months up
to two years  as services are performed over the life of the contract  revenue
is earned under the percentageofcompletion method utilizing units of delivery
costs  associated with contract  revenue are recognized as incurred  cash flows
page
vary with each  contract  although  generally a portion of the  contract fee is
paid at the time the  trial  begins  with the  balance  paid as  predetermined
contract  milestones  are  satisfied  prepayments  received  are recorded as a
liability under deferred revenue until work has been completed and revenue has
been earned generally  sponsors may terminate a contract with the company with
or without  cause  in the event of  termination  the  company is  entitled  to
payment  for all work  performed  through  the  termination  date and for  costs
associated with termination of the study

                              recent developments
                              

the  company has taken  steps to expand its  product  offerings  and improve the
competitiveness of each of its operating segments

in november  2001  the company  sold all the  operating  assets of its contract
manufacturing and packaging business unit to dpt lakewood inc an affiliate of
dpt  laboratories  ltd and dfb  pharmaceuticals  inc the sales price totaled
298 million  consisting of 28 million of cash and a 18 million note due in
2003 the sale resulted in a net loss of 252 million  or 176 per share the
balance of the proceeds received was used to repay  outstanding debt  following
the sale the company announced that it had consolidated its operations into two
segments pharmaceutical systems and drug delivery systems

in 2001 the company recorded a net  restructuring  charge of 29 million  the
charge  consisted  of  a  restructuring   provision  of  49  million  relating
principally  to  the  termination  of  approximately  25  midand  senior  level
management  positions  and a 20 million  adjustment  related to the sale of a
puerto rico plastic  device  manufacturing  facility held for sale from the 2000
restructuring program

in 2000 the company  recorded a  restructuring  charge of 150  million  this
charge  covered  a 92  million  goodwill  writedown  to the  site  management
organization of the clinical services business unit a 27 million reduction to
the estimated net realizable  value of a plastic device  manufacturing  plant in
puerto rico and 31 million of accrued severance  benefit and asset disposal
costs

also in 2000  the company  recorded 58 million of  restructuring  charges in
connection with its contract manufacturing and packaging operations this charge
consisted of a 50 million  reduction to the estimated net realizable  value of
assets to be sold and 08  million of  accrued  severance  benefit  and asset
disposal costs these costs are recorded as part of discontinued operations

in 1999  the company  changed its  business  plan with  respect to its plastics
strategy concerning future market demands and total capacity requirements  as a
result  the  company  reversed  a  portion  of its 1996  restructuring  reserve
pertaining to its puerto rico facility and wrote off the assets  associated with
a proprietary plastic product line that had not gained market acceptance


                                  order backlog
                                 

pharmaceutical  systems orders on hand at december 31 2001 were  approximately
105 million  compared with  approximately 92 million at the end of 2000 firm
orders on hand include those placed by customers for  manufacture  over a period
of time according to a customers schedule or upon confirmation by the customer
the company also has  contractual  arrangements  with a number of its customers
and products  covered by these  contracts are included in the companys  backlog
only as orders are received from those customers

page

drug  delivery  systems  segment  backlog  which is  primarily  related  to the
clinical  services  business  unit  consists  of  signed  contracts  yet to be
completed  contracts included in backlog are subject to termination or delay at
any time and therefore the backlog is not necessarily a meaningful  predictor of
future  results  delayed  contracts  remain  in  the  companys  backlog  until
cancelled  as of december 31 2001 the drug delivery  systems  segment backlog
was 41 million at december 31 2000 the backlog was 65 million

                                 raw materials
                                 

the company  uses three basic raw  materials  in the  manufacture  of its device
products  elastomers  aluminum  and plastic  the company has been  receiving
adequate supplies of raw materials to meet its production needs and it foresees
no significant availability problems in the near future

the company is  pursuing a supply  chain  management  strategy  which  involves
purchasing from  integrated  suppliers that control their own sources of supply
this  strategy  has reduced  the number of raw  material  suppliers  used by the
company  in some cases  the company will purchase raw materials  from a single
source to assure  quality and reduce costs  this  strategy  increases the risks
that the companys  supply lines may be  interrupted  in the event of a supplier
production problem these risks are managed by selecting suppliers with multiple
manufacturing sites rigid quality control systems surplus inventory levels and
other methods of maintaining supply in case of interruption in production

                              patents and licenses
                              

the  companys  device  products  patents  and  trademarks  have been  useful in
establishing  the  companys  market  share and in the  growth of the  companys
manufactured  device  product  business  and may  continue to be of value in the
future  especially in view of the companys  continuing  development of its own
proprietary  products  nevertheless  the company does not consider its current
manufactured device product business or its earnings to be materially  dependent
upon any single patent or trademark

the company  believes its drug delivery  development  capabilities  will play an
increasingly important role in the future the drug delivery business unit has a
growing portfolio of patented  technologies  which is critical to the companys
success because a significant  amount of future income is expected to be derived
from licensing this technology to customers

                                 major customers
                                

the company provides  manufactured device components andor contract services to
major   pharmaceutical   biotechnology  and  hospital   supplymedical   device
companies  many of  which  have  several  divisions  with  separate  purchasing
responsibilities  the  company  also  provides  clinical  research  and  market
research  services  to full  service  contract  research  and  consumer  product
organizations  the company  distributes  its products  and  services  primarily
through its own sales force but also uses  regional  distributors  in the united
states and in the asiapacific region

page

becton  dickinson  and company  bd  accounted for  approximately  13 of the
companys 2001  consolidated  net sales  the principal  products sold to bd are
synthetic  rubber  natural  rubber  metal and plastic  components used in bds
disposable and prefilled syringes and blood sampling and analysis devices  the
company expects to continue as a major bd supplier

excluding bd the next ten largest customers  accounted for approximately 30 of
the  companys  consolidated  net  sales in 2001  but no one of these  customers
accounted for more than 4 of 2001 consolidated net sales

                                   competition
                                   

the company competes with several  companies  some of which are larger than the
company  across its major  pharmaceutical  systems  product lines in addition
many  companies  worldwide  compete  with the  company for  business  related to
specific product lines  however  the company believes that it supplies a major
portion of the us market  requirements for pharmaceutical  elastomer and metal
packaging  components  and has a  significant  share of the european  market for
these components

because of the special nature of these products  competition is based primarily
on product design and performance  although total cost is becoming increasingly
more important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive cost control
programs across their entire operations  competitors often compete on the basis
of  price  the  company   differentiates  itself  from  its  competition  as  a
fullservice  supplier that is able to provide presale  compatibility studies
and other services and  sophisticated  post sale technical  support on a global
basis

the  company  competes  against  numerous  competitors  in the field of  plastic
closures  for consumer  products  many of which are larger than the company and
command significant market shares the company differentiates itself through its
expertise in highspeed assembly of multiplepiece closure systems

the clinical  research  industry is highly  fragmented  and comprised of several
large  fullservice contract research organizations cros many small cros and
limited services  providers  the major  competitors in the industry include the
research departments of pharmaceutical companies and cros

many  companies   provide   proprietary   drug  delivery   technologies  to  the
pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets  however unlike west the majority of
these companies are focused on a single route of drug  administration  and very
few have capabilities  necessary to take drug products through all stages of the
development process and commercial manufacture the three largest companies the
market leaders have multipledelivery technologies but their strong franchises
are  in  oral   controlledrelease   delivery  systems  wests  drug  delivery
technologies  none of which is currently in commercial production  are in less
competitive segments that do not compete with the market leaders

the  company  believes  that  its  international  business  does not  involve  a
substantially  greater  business  risk  than  its  domestic  business  although
financial  crises have been evident at various  times during recent years in the
asiapacific  region  and in major  markets in south  america  and have at times
resulted in a decline in demand for the  companys  products  in these  regions

pharmaceutical stoppers

the company is the worlds  largest  independent  manufacturer  of stoppers  for
sealing  drug  vials  and  other  pharmaceutical  containers   several  hundred
proprietary formulations are molded from natural rubber and synthetic elastomers
into a variety of stopper  sizes  shapes and colors  the  stoppers are used in
packaging serums vaccines antibiotics  anesthetics intravenous solutions and
other drugs and solutions

most stopper  formulations are specially designed to be compatible with drugs so
that  the  drugs  will  remain  effective  and  unchanged  during  storage  new
elastomeric  compounds  must be tested  to show that they do not leach  into the
customers  product or affect its potency  sterility  effectiveness  color or
clarity the companys laboratories conduct tests to determine the compatibility
of  its  stoppers  with  customers  drugs  and  in  the  united  states  file
formulation  information  with the food and drug  administration  in  support of
customers new drug applications

page

stoppers usually are washed  sterilized and subject to other preuse processes
by the customer or a thirdparty  before they are fitted on the  container  the
company has  introduced a valueadded  line of stoppers that are  prewashed and
ready  to be  sterilized  eliminating  several  steps  in  customers  incoming
processes  the company is also marketing a line of presterilized stoppers that
can be introduced directly into customers sterile drugfilling operations

metal seals

the company also offers a broad line of aluminum seals in various sizes shapes
and  colors  the  seals  are  crimped  onto  glass  or  plastic  pharmaceutical
containers  to hold the stoppers  securely in place  the top of aluminum  seals
often  contains  tamperevident  tabs or plastic  covers  which must be removed
before the drug can be withdrawn

some aluminum  seals are sold with  specially  formulated  rubber or elastomeric
discs  prefitted  inside the seal  these lined seals may be placed  directly
onto the  pharmaceutical  container  thus  eliminating  the need for a separate
stopper

other products

other products for the pharmaceutical industry include

         products  used in the  packaging  of  noninjectable  drugs such as
          rubber  dropper  bulbs  plastic  contraceptive  drug  packages   and
          childresistant and tamperevident plastic closures

         plastic  containers  bottles  and  closures  for the  consumer and
          medical device and diagnostic markets

         elastomeric and plastic components for empty and  prefilled
          disposable syringes such as plungers hubs and needle covers

         bloodsampling system components including vacuum tube stoppers and
          needle valves and a number of specialized  elastomeric and plastic
          components for bloodanalyzing systems and other medical devices

         components for iv sets

         disposable infant nursers and individual nurser components

the company  also  manufactures  a wide range of standard  and custom  designed
plastic threaded caps and containers for the personalcare  industry  the caps
produced  mainly for health and beauty aids  come in many  different  sizes and
colors  the company also makes closures for food and beverage  processors  the
company focuses its efforts on multiplepiece  closures that require  highspeed
assembly

product development

the  company  maintains  its own  laboratories  for testing  raw  materials  and
finished goods to assure conformity to customer  specifications and to safeguard
product  quality  laboratory  facilities  are also used for  development of new
products  engineering staffs are responsible for product and tooling design and
testing  and for  the  design  and  construction  of  processing  equipment  in
addition a corporate product development  department develops new packaging and
device concepts  approximately 94 professional  employees were engaged in these
activities in 2000  development and engineering  expenditures  for the creation
and application of new and improved device products and manufacturing  processes
were  approximately 93 million in 2000 89 million in 1999 and 89 million
in 1998 net of cost reimbursements by customers

contract packaging and contract manufacturing

the company  entered into the  pharmaceutical  services  market in 1995 with its
acquisition of paco  pharmaceutical  services  inc  paco  pacos name was
changed to west pharmaceutical services lakewood inc west lakewood

west  lakewood  provides  contract  manufacturing  and packaging of products for
pharmaceutical and consumerproducts  companies with its flexible manufacturing
environment and workforce  west lakewood has the capability to make and package
a variety of products according to customers specifications  usually employing
customersupplied  raw  materials  once its  work is  complete  west  lakewood
delivers the finished product to the customer for final sale and distribution to
the end user

customers  typically  use  west  lakewood  services  on  a  temporary  basis  to
supplement  their own  manufacturing  or packaging  capability  in times of peak
demand and during a newproduct introduction or special promotion however west
lakewood does retain longterm  business in both the manufacturing and packaging
areas west lakewood operates a facility in lakewood new jersey the canovanas
puerto rico facility was closed in early 2001 in  connection  with the companys
2000 restructuring plan

west lakewood contract  packaging and  manufacturing  processes and services are
subject  to  the  good  manufacturing   practice  standards  applicable  to  the
pharmaceutical  industry as well as to numerous other federal and state laws and
regulations governing the manufacture handling and packaging of drugs and other
regulated substances

west lakewood manufactures liquids  creams solids  suspensions  and powders
products produced include

           headache and cold medications

           skin lotions

           deodorants

           toothpaste and mouthwash

           paperboard specialty packages

           innovative tamperevident and childresistant packages

although  the type of  package  depends  on the  requirements  of the  customer
blister  packaging or bottles  typically are used for tablets and capsules while
aluminum  or plastic  cups  pouches  bottles  and tubes are used for  liquids
creams ointments and powders

clinical services

the  company  entered  into the  clinical  services  market  with its april 1999
acquisition  of  the  clinical  services  division  of  collaborative   clinical
research  inc the clinical services group operates three business units these
business units  which are described more fully below are a phase ithroughiv
clinical  trial  research  facility  the gfi  research  center  a  clinical
research group cro that conducts  marketing and clinical  research studies for
customers prescription drugs consumer products and otc switch projects and a
site management  organization smo that provides  assistance for clinical trial
studies  the smo unit will be closed in early 2001  with ongoing studies being
supported through their conclusion

wests gfi research center  conducts phase i through phase iv clinical  research
trials and provides other clinical research services including device and actual
use studies at its 80bed unit located in evansville  indiana phase i research
is  substantially  more  demanding  than other phases of the  clinical  research
process  because  healthy  volunteers  must  typically  be  sequestered  for the
duration of the study  phase iiiv studies are frequently more specialized with
respect to  therapeutic  patient  populations  required  the diversity of gfis
service  offering  has aided  the  development  of both  their  recruitment  and
clinical operations capabilities

the cro performs a variety of rx clinical  services that assist client companies
in completing  phase iiiv clinical  trials and  consumerrelated  research that
assists  sponsor  companies  with rxtootc  switch and other  consumer  product
research  studies  the cro capabilities  include project  management  clinical
study   site   identification    patient   recruitment    monitoring    data
managementstatistics  and report writing  west is distinguished by its unique
blend of clinical  research and marketing  research as well as specialty patient
recruitment services

page

clinical services division contracts provide a fixed price for each component or
service delivered  the ultimate contract value depends on such variables as the
number of research sites  selected  the number of patients  enrolled  and
other services required by the sponsor  these contracts range in duration from
several months to several years  as services are performed over the life of the
contract revenue is earned under the percentageof completion method utilizing
units of delivery  costs associated with contract revenue are recognized as
incurred  cash flows vary with each contract although generally a portion of
the contract fee is paid at the time the trial begins with the balance paid as
predetermined contract  milestones  are satisfied  prepayments received are
recorded as a liability under  deferred revenue until work has been completed
and revenue has been recognized  generally sponsors may terminate a contract
with the company with or without cause in the event of termination the company
is entitled to payment for all work performed through the termination  date and
for costs associated with termination of the study

contract laboratory services

in 1998 the company  established  the contract  laboratory  services  business
which provides  testing services to analyze  customers drug product  packaging
regulatory  agencies  require  drug  companies  to  demonstrate  that  packaging
components  will not contaminate the drug the test data generated is acceptable
for us food and drug  administration  fda submissions  the services offered
include  extractables  testing  method  development and  validation  stability
testing for extractables and active  substances  moisture analysis of closures
quantification  of closure  surface  silicone  and other custom  services  the
companys laboratory complies with applicable good manufacturing  practice gmp
standards and is fda registered

                              drug delivery systems
                           

since 1993 the company has been developing  proprietary  drug delivery  systems
for various  drug and  biological  products  for which  alternative  methods and
routes of  administration  might  improve  therapeutic  performance  or the cost
effectiveness of the therapy in furtherance of that effort in 1998 the company
completed the acquisition of danbiosyst uk ltd dbs a research and development
company  located in nottingham  england  dbs was renamed west  pharmaceutical
services  drug  delivery    clinical  research  center  ltd  in 1999  and its
operations   integrated  with  the  companys   lionville  based  drug  delivery
operations  to  form  a  new  operating  segment  drug  delivery  research  and
development

west drug delivery  engages in both  independent and  clientfunded  research to
develop unique  delivery  technologies  patenting  these where  possible  and
subject  to any rights  granted  or ceded in  connection  with  client  funding
retains the rights to exploit the patented  technology  west drug  delivery has
patents or patent  applications  covering a range of delivery  technologies  for
various routes of administration  including nasal oral parenteral pulmunary
rectal and vaginal west drug delivery then seeks to license the technologies to
pharmaceutical  companies  for use in  combination  with  their  drug  products
alternatively west will develop unique versions of generic drug products which
incorporate its proprietary delivery technologies and then seek development and
marketing partners or licensees for the resulting  products  west drug delivery
also maintains  laboratory and clinical scale  manufacturing  capabilities  that
support client and internal development projects

page

in 2000 west drug deliverys efforts were focused on  clientfunded  projects
on the further development of proprietary formulations of the drugs morphine and
leuprolide  both using the companys  patented  chitosanbased  nasal  delivery
system  and on the  development  of a proprietary  formulation of budesonide a
steroid using the companys targitr system an orally administered specially
coated  starch capsule system  designed to bypass normal  digestion and deliver
the drug to  particular  regions  of the colon for  local and  systemic  effect
initial  human  studies of the nasal  morphine  product were  completed  and the
product was licensed to a third party for further development in 2001

west drug delivery had 65 employees as of december 31 2000 and total  expenses
net of revenues received were 90 million in 2000 and 77 million in 1999

                              recent developments
                              

the  company  has taken  steps to  expand  its  product  offerings  and  improve
competitiveness  of both its device product  development  and contract  services
operating segments

in 1996 and 1997 the company implemented a major restructuring plan announced
in 1996  the plan included the closing or downsizing of six manufacturing
facilities withdrawal  from  the  machinery  business  and an  approximate  5
reduction in the workforce  the restructuring was designed to reduce the costs
associated with multiple plant sites and shift certain  production  capacity to
lowercost locations  in 1998 a further 1 reduction in the workforce made
possible by manufacturing  and other  operating  efficiencies  was  announced
additional information pertaining to the 1998 activities is incorporated by
reference to the note restructuring charges of notes to consolidated financial
statements of the  2000 annual report to shareholders

in 1998 the company acquired betraine limited a company located in england
which manufactures  precision  injection  molded  plastic  components  for  the
healthcare and consumer industries the acquisition expanded global capabilities
in the   noninjectable   market  the companys name was changed to west
pharmaceutical services lewes westlewes

in 1999  the company  changed its  business  plan with  respect to its plastics
strategy concerning future market demands and total capacity requirements  as a
result  the  company  reversed  a  portion  of its 1996  restructuring  reserve
pertaining to its puerto rico facility and wrote off the assets  associated with
a proprietary plastic product line that had not gained market acceptance

in november  2000  the company  announced a plan to streamline  operations  and
improve  operating  efficiencies by reducing or consolidating  business units in
its contract services and device product development segments the plan included
the  closure of two plants in puerto  rico  engaged in  contract  packaging  and
plastics  device  molding and the   sterilefill  suite at the lakewood  new
jersey  facility  and the  initiation  of other staff  reduction  cost  control
measures  in  addition   the  site  management   organization  smo  business
operations  of the clinical  services  business  unit was closed as the business
model has proven  unsuccessful in the  marketplace and estimated  growth has not
materialized  an aftertax  charge of 155 million was taken to fourth quarter
2000 earnings to reflect the writedown of goodwill asset writeoffs  severance
charges and other restructuring related costs

                                  order backlog
                                 

device  product  orders on hand at december  31  2000  was  approximately  92
million  compared with  approximately 96 million at the end of 1999 orders on
hand include  those placed by customers  for  manufacture  over a period of time
according to a customers schedule or upon confirmation by the customer  orders
are  generally  considered  firm when  goods  are  manufactured  or  orders  are
confirmed  the company also has contractual  arrangements  with a number of its
customers and products covered by these contracts are included in the companys
backlog only as orders are received from those customers

west   lakewoods   twelvemonth   backlog  of  unfilled   customer  orders  was
approximately  11 million at december  31 2000 and 9 million at december  31
1999  backlog is defined by west  lakewood as orders  written  and  included in
production schedules during the next twelve months such orders generally may be
cancelled by the customer without penalty

the clinical  services  division  backlog consists of signed contracts yet to be
completed  contracts included in backlog are subject to termination or delay at
any time and therefore the backlog is not necessarily a meaningful  predictor of
future  results  delayed  contracts  remain  in  the  companys  backlog  until
canceled  as of december 31 2000 the clinical services divisions backlog was
65 million at december 31 1999 the backlog was 62 million

                                 raw materials
                                 

the company  uses three basic raw  materials  in the  manufacture  of its device
products  elastomers  aluminum  and plastic  the company has been  receiving
adequate supplies of raw materials to meet its production needs and it foresees
no significant availability problems in the near future

the company is  pursuing a supply  chain  management  strategy  which  involves
purchasing from  integrated  suppliers that control their own sources of supply
this  strategy  has reduced the number of raw  materials  suppliers  used by the
company  in some cases  the company will purchase raw materials  from a single
source to assure  quality and reduce costs  this  strategy  increases the risks
that the companys  supply lines may be  interrupted  in the event of a supplier
production problem these risks are managed by selecting suppliers with multiple
manufacturing sites rigid quality control systems surplus inventory levels and
other methods of maintaining supply in case of interruption in production

                              patents and licenses
                              

the  companys  device  products  patents  and  trademarks  have been  useful in
establishing  the  companys  market  share and in the  growth of the  companys
manufactured  device  product  business  and may  continue to be of value in the
future  especially in view of the companys  continuing  development of its own
proprietary  products  nevertheless  the company does not consider its current
manufactured device product business or its earnings to be materially  dependent
upon any single patent or trademark

although  not  material at this time  the company  believes  its drug  delivery
development capabilities will play an increasingly important role in the future
the  drug  delivery  operating  segment  has a  growing  portfolio  of  patented
technology  which is critical to the  companys  success  because a significant
amount of future income is expected to be derived from licensing this technology
to customers

                                major customers
                                

the company provides  manufactured device components andor contract services to
major   pharmaceutical   biotechnology  and  hospital   supplymedical   device
companies  many of  which  have  several  divisions  with  separate  purchasing
responsibilities  the company also  provides  contract  packaging  and contract
manufacturing  services for many of the leading  manufacturers  of personal care
products  and  clinical  research  services to full  service  contract  research
organizations  the company  distributes  its products  and  services  primarily
through its own sales force but also uses  regional  distributors  in the united
states and in the asiapacific region

becton  dickinson  and company  bd  accounted for  approximately  13 of the
companys 2000  consolidated  net sales  the principal  products sold to bd are
synthetic  rubber  natural  rubber  metal and plastic  components used in bds
disposable syringes and blood sampling and analysis devices the company expects
to continue as a major bd supplier

excluding bd the next ten largest customers  accounted for approximately 35 of
the  companys  consolidated  net  sales in 2000  but no one of these  customers
accounted for more than 7 of 2000 consolidated net sales

                                   competition
                                   

the company competes with several  companies  some of which are larger than the
company across its major device product development product lines in addition
many  companies  worldwide  compete  with the  company for  business  related to
specific product lines  however  the company believes that it supplies a major
portion of the us market  requirements for pharmaceutical  elastomer and metal
packaging  components  and has a  significant  share of the european  market for
these components

page

because of the special nature of these products  competition is based primarily
on product design and performance  although total cost is becoming increasingly
more important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive cost control
programs across their entire operations  competitors often compete on the basis
of  price  the  company   differentiates  itself  from  its  competition  as  a
fullservice  supplier that is able to provide presale  compatibility studies
and other services and  sophisticated  post sale technical  support on a global
basis

the  company  competes  against  numerous  competitors  in the field of  plastic
closures  for consumer  products  many of which are larger than the company and
command significant market shares the company differentiates itself through its
expertise in highspeed assembly of multiplepiece closure systems

the us  contract  packaging  and  manufacturing  service  industry  is  highly
competitive   for  packaging  services   west  lakewood  competes  with  three
significant   companies   all  of  which  are  larger  than  it  for  contract
manufacturing  services  west lakewood competes with four major competitors and
several smaller regional companies several of these competitors are larger than
it in  addition  most  domestic  pharmaceutical  companies  maintain  inhouse
manufacturing  and packaging  capabilities  and at times will offer their excess
capacity  to  manufacture  or package  other  companies  products on a contract
basis however most large pharmaceutical and personal healthcare companies have
traditionally made extensive use of contract packagers and manufacturers  during
times  of  peak  demand  during  the  introduction  of a new  product  and  for
production of samples and special product promotions

the clinical  research  industry is highly  fragmented  and comprised of several
large  fullservice contract research organizations cros many small cros and
limited services  providers  the major  competitors in the industry include the
research departments of pharmaceutical companies and cros

many  companies   provide   proprietary   drug  delivery   technologies  to  the
pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets  however unlike west the majority of
these companies are focused on a single route of drug  administration  and very
few have capabilities  necessary to take drug products through all stages of the
development process and commercial manufacture the three largest companies the
market leaders have multipledelivery technologies but their strong franchises
are  in  oral   controlledrelease   delivery  systems  wests  drug  delivery
technologies  none of which is currently in commercial production  are in less
competitive segments that do not compete with the market leaders

consolidated  financial statements of the 2000 annual report to shareholders are
incorporated herein by reference

the  company  believes  that  its  international  business  does not  involve  a
substantially  greater  business  risk  than  its  domestic  business  although
financial  crises have been evident at various  times during recent years in the
asiapacific  region and in our major markets in south america and have at times
resulted in a decline in demand for the  companys  products  in these  regions
direct  sales  to  customers  in  these  markets  have   historically  not  been
significant  in 2000  such  sales  represented  less than 10 of  consolidated
sales
