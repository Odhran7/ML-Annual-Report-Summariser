 item 11 executive compensation 

compensation discussion and analysis 

the 2021 compensation of our named executive officers appropriately reflects and rewards their significant contributions to transdigm’s strong performance in another year that presented unique and unprecedented challenges for our executive team to manage this compensation discussion and analysis explains the guiding principles and practices upon which our executive compensation program is based and the compensation paid to our named executive officers 

• kevin stein president chief executive officer and director 

• michael lisman chief financial officer 

• jorge l valladares iii chief operating officer 

• sarah wynne chief accounting officer 

• robert henderson former vice chairman 

• w nicholas howley former executive chair 

mr howley transitioned from executive chair to nonexecutive chair in august 2021 as described elsewhere in this compensation discussion and analysis mr howley was no longer an employee after such date mr henderson retired as vice chairman in december 2021 

guiding principles 

performance expectations we establish clear quantitative robust financial goals focused on transdigm’s overall success and impact 

stockholder alignment we establish ownership policies that encourage longterm equity retention and due to our unique capital allocation philosophy have dividend equivalent rights to “make whole” executives who hold vested performance options 

focus on longterm equity incentives we have limited fixed cash compensation ie salary and annual incentive and emphasize longterm performance and retention by significantly weighting our named executive officers toward longterm equity awards 

executive compensation policies and practices 

we are committed to sound executive compensation policies and practices as highlighted in the following table 



compensation committee judgment and discretion 

the compensation committee consisting entirely of independent directors reviews and approves the compensation of transdigm’s named executive officers and acts as the administrator for transdigm’s equity compensation plans 

the compensation committee’s executive compensation determinations are subjective and the result of the compensation committee’s business judgment which is informed by the experience of its members and input provided by its independent compensation consultant our chief executive officer other than with respect to his own compensation other members of management and investors 

the compensation committee regularly evaluates transdigm’s executive compensation program to determine if changes are appropriate in so doing the compensation committee may consult with its independent compensation consultant and management however the compensation committee makes final decisions regarding the compensation paid to our named executive officers based on its own judgment the compensation may consider factors such as individual performance company performance market conditions financial goals retention and shareholder interests in determining compensation 

the role of the compensation consultant the compensation committee selects and retains the services of an independent compensation consultant the independent compensation consultant is independent in accordance with sec and nyse rules during 2021 the compensation committee’s independent compensation consultant veritas executive compensation consultants provided no services to transdigm other than services for the compensation committee and worked with transdigm’s management only on matters for which the compensation committee is responsible 

the role of the chief executive officer at the compensation committee’s request for 2021 mr howley provided input regarding the performance and compensation of mr stein and mr stein provided input regarding the performance and compensation of the other named executive officers the compensation committee considered mr howley’s and mr stein’s evaluation and direct knowledge of each named executive officer’s performance and contributions when making compensation decisions mr stein is not present during compensation committee voting and deliberations regarding his own compensation and when he was formerly an employee mr howley was not present during compensation committee voting and deliberations regarding his own compensation 

the role of investors stockholders are provided the opportunity to cast an annual advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers last year investors did not support the compensation of our named executive officers with only 43 of votes cast on the sayonpay proposal at the 2021 annual meeting voted in favor of our executive compensation program accordingly we have made a number of changes to our executive compensation program for 2022 we have ongoing discussions with many of our investors regarding various corporate governance topics including environment social and governance topics and executive compensation the compensation committee considers these discussions while reviewing our executive compensation program 

the role of peer companies with the assistance of veritas executive compensation consultants the compensation committee identifies companies to serve as market reference points for compensation comparison purposes at least every other year in may 2021 the compensation committee engaged veritas executive compensation consultants to do a survey of total standard compensation components for the certain executives including the named executive officers other than the chief accounting officer in doing so we specifically asked that they exclude dividend equivalent payments “deps” for two reasons—first because we view deps as putting the executive in the place of the stockholder without requiring an exercise and typically accompanying sale to for example offset taxes and second because including episodic deps in a compensation review is not going to be as insightful as the anomalies of deps will distort any peer analysis 

veritas used a peer group based on revenue market capitalization and enterprise value we use a size based peer group because we manage our business based on ebitda as defined growth and enterprise value the compensation committee previously rejected a peer group based solely on revenue as being not comparable with transdigm because transdigm’s market capitalization and enterprise value far exceeded those of the potential revenuebased peers transdigm used as its peer group the following companies 



the survey determined that the named executive officers as a whole were positioned at the low end of the peer group in terms of cash compensation but in the high end of the peer group in terms of total standard compensation and opportunities but that the chief operating officer received cash compensation above the median compared to peers 

the compensation committee considers peer group data provided by its independent compensation consultant to inform its decisionmaking process so it can set total compensation levels that it believes are commensurate with the relative size scope and success of transdigm the compensation committee generally targets to pay salary and annual incentive to most executives below the median of our peers 

2021 named executive officer compensation 

our executive compensation program is designed to motivate and reward performance in a straightforward and effective way while recognizing transdigm’s private equity philosophy management style and targeted returns the compensation of our named executive officers has three primary components i annual base salary ii annual cash incentive and iii longterm equity awards in the form of performancebased options in addition our options have attendant to them dividend equivalent rights 

2021 annual base salary base salary is a customary fixed element of compensation intended to attract and retain executives when setting the annual base salaries of our named executive officers the compensation committee considers market data provided by its independent compensation consultant internal pay equity and transdigm’s financial results the compensation committee determined that effective january 1 2021 the base salaries of messrs stein lisman and valladares and ms wynne should be 1225000 600000 680000 and 450000 per year respectively as discussed elsewhere in this form 10k pursuant to the terms of their respective employment agreements mr howley and mr henderson did not receive a cash salary for 2021 the only annual cash salary each was entitled to was in the amount of 7000 and 10000 respectively and was for health insurance and related taxes the remaining compensation of each was paid in performancebased stock options more specifically in accordance with his employment agreement the compensation committee granted mr henderson options to purchase 4013 shares in lieu of 2021 salary 482 of which were forfeited upon his retirement in december 2021 mr howley received options to purchase 11484 shares in lieu of 2021 salary calculated in accordance with his employment agreement 

2021 annual incentives our annual cash incentive program is a variable atrisk component of our named executive officers’ compensation that is aligned with transdigm’s annual financial results for fiscal year 2021 our annual incentives were based on ebitda as defined and ebitda as defined margin 1  this was a change from prior years that was originally in response to investor concern over overlapping metrics in transdigm’s annual incentive and stock option plans although the inability to establish annual operating performance targets in 2021 did result in overlap of metrics under the two plans for 2021 that will not be the case in 2022 and beyond the compensation committee has eliminated the overlapping metric in the longterm incentive plan and commits that it will not use overlapping metrics going forward the committee retains the authority to increase or decrease the award by up to 20 based on assessment of individual performance including without limitation degree of difficulty of the achievement of metrics and the individual’s job effectiveness the effectiveness of transdigm’s value drivers a pattern of clear open honest and regular communication with the board and investors as applicable effective succession planning and organizational development support maintenance and regular evaluation of the effectiveness of transdigm’s long term value focused strategy or other factors 

annual cash incentive payouts are determined based on an equal weighting for the ebitda as defined and ebitda as defined margin performance measures as approved by the compensation committee and are linearly interpolated for achievement between threshold target and maximum goals if the threshold performance level is reached the total payout opportunity is 70 of the target payout opportunity and if the maximum performance level is reached the payout opportunity is 130 of the target payout opportunity unless the threshold goal is achieved for a performance measure there is no payout for that performance measure 

when setting the goals focused on ebitda as defined and ebitda as defined margin for fiscal 2021 the compensation committee considered many factors including the uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic and its impact on worldwide travel and the aerospace industry and the extent of management’s ability to predict and influence performance the compensation committee considered the likelihood of a range of scenarios for ebitda as defined and ebitda as defined margin and factors that were projected to have an impact on fiscal 2021 ebitda as defined and ebitda as defined margin based on these considerations in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 the compensation committee set annual threshold target and maximum cash incentive plan goals at levels they considered appropriately rigorous for the year and that represented strong financial performance under challenging business conditions if the threshold goal was met management would receive 70 of the target incentive if the target goal was met management would receive 100 of the target incentive and if the maximum goal was met management would receive 130 of the target incentive the threshold for ebitda as defined was 1873 million the target goal was 2177 million and the maximum goal was 2481 million the threshold for ebitda as defined margin was 405 the target goal was 445 and the maximum goal was 485 amounts in between the threshold and target or target and maximum goals would be determined by linear interpolation 



1 references made within item 11 executive compensation to “ebitda as defined” means ebitda plus as applicable for each relevant period certain adjustments on a pro forma basis which is defined in the same manner as the consolidated ebitda used to measure the ratio of our secured indebtedness required under a financial covenant of our senior secured credit facility “ebitda as defined margin” refers to the percentage calculated by dividing ebitda as defined by net sales on a pro forma basis for the applicable period reference reconciliation to pro forma ebitda as defined and pro forma ebitda as defined margin included below for additional details and ‘nongaap financial measures under item 2  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our 2021 form 10k filed on november 16 2021 for reconciliation to the relevant us gaap measures including the usefulness and inherent limitations over nongaap financial measures 

for fiscal 2021 our ebitda as defined was 2183 million and our ebitda as defined margin was 461 these results exceeded our targets and resulted in a payout of 1062 the following sets forth a reconciliation of ebitda as defined to pro forma ebitda as defined and pro forma ebitda as defined margin amounts in millions

mr howley did not receive an annual incentive as the remainder of any compensation owed to him under his employment agreement was forfeited in connection with the grant he received in connection with his transition to nonexecutive chairman 

we will continue to use ebitda as defined and ebitda as defined margin with threshold target and maximum goals for 2022 we have eliminated the overlapping metrics in our annual incentive program and our longterm equity incentive program 

2021 equity based incentives 

in 2021 mr stein received a grant of 68000 options that vest based on performance conditions in fiscal 2025 mr lisman and ms wynne received grants of 57700 and 18000 options respectively that vest based on performance conditions equally over five years mr valladares and mr henderson received grants of 58300 and 22125 options respectively that vest based on performance conditions equally in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 80 of mr henderson’s options were forfeited upon his retirement in december 2021 

mr howley received a grant of 71039 options that vest based on performance conditions in 2022  2024 a 2021 salary grant of 21891 options that vest based on performance conditions in 2022 and 2023 and in august 2021 a grant of 105000 options in exchange for termination of his employment agreement and transition to nonexecutive chairman that vest based on performance conditions in 2022  2024 in his role as chairman of the board mr howley will continue to primarily focus his efforts on matters relating to significant mergers and acquisitions capital allocation and deployment major strategic initiatives and issues and leadership of the board of directors the option grant will be the sole compensation for mr howley’s service on the board through 2024 

performancebased stock option program 

overview 

the equity component of our management’s compensation emphasizes longterm stockholder value creation through performancebased options this is a substantial atrisk component of our management’s compensation that is tied to performance we believe that performancebased stock option grants motivate and incentivize management to focus on longterm performance and align the interests of our management with the interests of stockholders by reinforcing the longterm goal of increasing stockholder value and yielding returns comparable to or higher than wellperforming private equity funds and promoting the stability and retention of our highperforming executive team over the longterm our stock option program covers management at the corporate level and our 46 operating units for a total of approximately 270 people 

generally executives other than the ceo do not receive annual grants of options rather executives and other plan participants receive options that vest over five years in connection with hirings promotions and the assumption of increased responsibilities thereafter unless there has been an intervening fiveyear award because of a promotion executives and other plan participants receive biennial extension awards that vest in the fourth and fifth year following the award these grants are generally made in the third year of vesting under the initial award so that the employee has four or five years of future option vesting in order to promote maximizing longterm value and retention 

performancebased option vesting at rigorous targets 

option vesting is subject to rigorous performance hurdles after a hiatus of using our historical performance metric annual operating performance “aop” due to covid we have returned to that metric for all options granted in 2020 – 2022 and intend to continue to use it going forward the minimum threshold for any option vesting requires a 10 cumulative growth in aop for maximum vesting the growth rate required is 175 for each performance period transdigm uses this compound annual growth rate range because it will incent management to create value for stockholders at a rate that outperforms the typical private equity model the aop metric focuses management on ebitda as defined growth management of capital structure cash generation and acquisition performance through these performancebased options with fiveyear performance periods we believe we have optimized management incentive to drive stockholder value creation over the long term and appropriately linked compensation with financial performance 

specifically aop targets are set at the time of grant and represent an intrinsic share price they are set by taking the prior year’s aop and increasing such amount by 10 and 175 respectively to establish the minimum and maximum targets in other words as demonstrated in the chart below the intrinsic share price must grow at a compound annual growth rate of 10 for any vesting to even occur at all for 100 vesting the intrinsic share price must grow at a compound annual growth rate of 175  targets are thus robust requiring 175 compound annual growth from the most recently completed year for maximum vesting in an effort to achieve growth at or above the longterm returns of top performing private equity funds this is consistent with our objective of providing stockholders with returns at or above those of wellperforming private equity funds 

targets are calculated based on a ratio of a the excess of i ebitda as defined multiplied by an acquisitionweighted market multiple over ii net debt to b the company’s number of diluted shares based on the treasury stock method of accounting the targets are adjusted for dividends and share repurchases hence aop takes into consideration the following 

• growth in ebitda as defined 

• management of capital structure 

• cash generation 

• acquisition performance including the acquisition price paid and 

• the impact of option dilution on common shares outstanding 

we use aop growth ie growth in intrinsic equity value as the performancebased metric for many reasons 

• it focuses management on the fundamentals of stockholder value creation eg ebitda as defined cash generation capital structure management and return of capital as appropriate 

• this is the basic private equity formula for value that management has focused on achieving since its inception in 1993 

• over the long term we believe that market value of our stock will generally follow intrinsic value 

targets are adjusted for dividends paid to stockholders and share repurchases we believe the adjustments are appropriate and necessary to account for the early return of value to stockholders because if a portion of the investment is returned early via special dividend or return of capital the subsequent years’ targets must be adjusted to reflect the revised capital structure and maintain the same irrbased performance requirements adjustment of the targets does not make the targets any easier to achieve but rather maintains the irr targets 

as previously disclosed for 2021 limited solely to options granted in 2020 and 2021 with vesting in 2021 we determined we were unable to establish aop targets due to the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic on the aviation industry 10 to 175 aop growth from 2020 was unattainable for 2021 because of the record performance in the first half of fiscal 2020 and the pandemic’s continuing impact the compensation committee considered using the latter half of the year as a baseline but ultimately concluded that it had no visibility into whether those targets would be too easy or unreasonably unattainable the compensation committee strongly believed that in order to provide appropriate incentive the performance goals needed to be based on matters within management’s control therefore the compensation committee determined to measure 2021 performance against the primary metric to which management had been managing – ebitda as defined margin percentage – and also as incentive to maintain earnings ebitda as defined these metrics were temporarily used for certain grants under the company’s option program – those being options granted in 2020 with vesting in 2021 predominantly those are for promotion and new hire grants and options granted in 2021 with vesting in 2021 again predominantly those are for promotion and new hire grants the performance criteria for vesting in 2022 and beyond including in previously granted options has reverted back to the aop metric and requires cumulative growth of 10 to 175 

other option terms 

because we view our performance on a longterm basis and the targets are set to achieve longterm compound annual and cumulative growth if the annual performance per share exceeds the maximum target in an applicable year such excess may be treated as having been achieved in the following two fiscal years andor the prior two fiscal years without duplication if less than the full amount of options would otherwise have vested for such years this allows management to focus on longterm value without having to make shortterm decisions to maximize vesting in a particular year we believe this feature acts similarly to longterm incentive plans that take into account performance over a multiyear period we also believe this plan feature mitigates compensation risk because if performance were measured in only oneyear “snapshot” increments management could be incentivized to sacrifice longer term goals to achieve vesting in the short term because the compensation committee did not want the pandemic market recovery to result in growth targets that might be too easily achieved the aop carryover for options granted in 2020 2021 and 2022 is limited to a cap of 100 

in addition to vesting based on operational targets in the event of a change in control options become fully vested we do not provide for any gross up to any payments that would be deemed to be “excess parachute payments” under section 280g of the internal revenue code 

treatment of options for executives upon termination 

option agreements for certain officers including all of the named executive officers provide that if the officer’s employment terminates by reason of death disability without cause for good reason or retirement after age 65 with 10 years of service or after age 60 and 15 years of service vesting of the options will continue after termination generally as follows 





1 options will continue to vest in accordance with their terms if and only if the performance criteria are met remaining unvested options would vest ratably over the remaining performance vesting schedule 

treatment of options for executives upon termination 

option are granted generally at regularly scheduled board meetings during november through april because all options vest based on performance criteria and vesting occurs at the end of each fiscal year grants for any new hire or promoted employee who would otherwise receive a grant after april in any year are deferred until november mr howley’s grant in connection with the termination of his employment agreement and transition to chairman was made in august 2021 but no vesting will occur thereunder until the end of fiscal 2022 and performance targets were set using fiscal 2022 criteria 

options to purchase 811308 shares of common stock were granted under the program in fiscal 2021 the number of shares subject to the 2014 stock option plan is 5000000 of which 626294 shares remained available for granting under the plan as of september 30 2021 the number of shares subject to the 2019 stock option plan is 4000000 of which all shares remain available for granting under the plan as of september 30 2021 

dividends and dividend equivalents 

dividends 

dividend decisions like at other companies are a capital structure decision made by the board we do not have a policy of paying regular dividends instead the board regularly evaluates our capital allocation optionality and will declare a special dividend based on an assessment of availability of cash or borrowing capacity outlook for acquisitions and other operating needs favorable capital market conditions and the availability of surplus under applicable law as well as certain operating performance covenants under our credit facilities 

our preference for capital allocation is to invest in existing businesses or make accretive acquisitions but when internal business needs are met and acquisitions are not available we elect to allocate capital to return to stockholders because of the constantly dynamic state of acquisition opportunities as well as other external forces such as the health of credit markets geopolitical activity competitive industry opportunities and pressures these special dividends are unpredictable episodic and unlike other companies have historically been very large most recently we paid a dividend of 3000 per share in fiscal 2019 and a 3250 dividend in fiscal 2020 we also paid two dividends totaling 4600 per share in fiscal 2017 however we paid no dividends in fiscal 2015 2016 2018 or 2021 

dividend decisions are made exclusive of compensatory impact and compensation decisions are made without regard to the possibility of dividend equivalent payments however due to the unique structure of our executive compensation program which targets significantly less cash compensation relative to peers in the short term but provides extraordinary upside in the long term the compensation committee believes our use of deps are critical to the understanding of what motivates our executive team and assures alignment between management and investors on capital allocation decisions 

dividend equivalent payments “deps” 

in order to closely align management and stockholder interests in all aspects of our operations and capital structure we have dividend equivalent plans that provide option holders the right to receive dividend equivalent payments if the board declares a dividend on our common stock maintaining an even playing field between constituencies is important to and consistent with our private equity compensation philosophy as such the compensation committee strongly believes that absent the deps the option holders would be at a clear disadvantage to stockholders which would incentivize the exercise and sale eg to satisfy tax obligations of vested options and could undermine the alignment of their interests with those of stockholders we believe that failure to align management and stockholders could create incentives for management to deploy cash flow and utilize borrowing capacity in a manner other than the return of capital in the form of extraordinary dividends which might not be in the best interests of stockholders further management may be incentivized to seek shortterm market gains rather than focusing on longterm equity value and stockholder returns dividend equivalents align management with the stockholders to permit the best allocation of capital resources and incentivize longterm share value growth without a hyper focus on short term stock price fluctuations 

importantly pursuant to the dividend equivalent plans employees receive deps on options i that have vested based on rigorous performance criteria and ii that the option holder has chosen not to exercise even though vested option holders who hold vested stock options at the time a dividend is paid will receive a cash dep equal to the amount that he or she would otherwise have been entitled to receive had his or her vested stock option been exercised immediately prior to payment of the dividend option holders who hold unvested stock options will receive a cash dep equal to the amount he or she would otherwise have been entitled to receive had his or her unvested stock option been vested and exercised immediately prior to payment of the dividend but only if and when such stock option vests pursuant to its terms we believe that we have structured deps under the company’s dividend equivalent plans such that they are not subject to any excise tax under section 409a of the internal revenue code certain investors and proxy advisory firms have raised the issue as to whether the company should pay dividend equivalents only upon an exercise of the options however we believe that tying payment of the dividend equivalents to the exercise of an option would result in excise taxes under section 409a 

prohibition on hedging pledging and short sales no director officer or employee is permitted to pledge transdigm stock or engage in short sales or other transactions that hedge or offset or are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of the transdigm’s stock we allow for certain portfolio diversification transactions such as investments in exchange funds all of the directors and executive officers are in compliance with this policy 

equity ownership guidelines we require management to maintain a significant personal investment in the company all of the company’s existing option holders are required to maintain ownership of a minimum value of stock or vested options elected officers must retain half of their retention limit in stock mr howley is required to hold 10 million in aggregate value mr stein is required to retain 6 million in aggregate value and the other named executive officers are required to hold 15 to 25 million in aggregate value of stock or vested options each executive officer currently holds shares in excess of these guidelines shares may be owned directly by the individual owned jointly with or separately by the individual’s spouse or held in trust for the benefit of the individual the individual’s spouse or the individual’s children 

compensation risk 

the compensation committee has reviewed and evaluated the incentive compensation policies and practices that cover all employees on the basis of that review the compensation committee does not believe that its compensation policies and practices pose risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on transdigm 

results of sayonpay vote 

overview of sayonpay vote history  advisory firm recommendation effect 

our board and management recognize that solicitation and stockholder feedback is important to creating stockholder value as a result we regularly engage with our stockholders 

preceding our annual meetings in 2018 and 2019 we engaged with shareholders representing approximately 75 of our shares most of the stockholders were satisfied with the overall design of our program of the stockholders that voted against sayonpay there was no consistent reason cited 

outreach prior to our 2020 annual meeting had the following results 

• we reached out to our top 31 stockholders representing 73 of our shares outstanding to discuss compensation matters eight of those stockholders elected to have a discussion while the others declined because they were satisfied with the design of our plan andor we have had prior discussions and they had no questions 

• we continued to find that most actively managed funds generally liked the design of our compensation plan the few who had objections continued to not cite a consistent reason however we heard several issues from more than one firm the following is a summary of those issues and our response 



outreach for the 2021 annual meeting had the following results 

• we reached out 47 of our top 50 shareholders representing 77 of our shares outstanding to discuss compensation matters for our 2021 annual meeting twelve of those shareholders elected to have a discussion while many of the others declined because they were satisfied with the design of our plan andor we have had prior discussions and they had no questions 

• while shareholders were encouraged by the responsive compensation plan changes that were implemented since the 2020 annual meeting two additional concerns which arose primarily due the covid19 pandemic were mentioned several times 



vote results 

the say onpay vote result for the 2021 annual meeting was 4298 in favor of sop the vote reflected stockholder dissent with the vesting of 2020 options and change in approach to performance criteria the committee addressed both of these concerns by adopting the changes to our compensation program described herein

1 amounts assume that the named executive officer was not terminated in connection with the change in control if the named executive was terminated without cause in connection with a change in control his compensation would also include amounts listed in the column for “termination without cause” 

director compensation 

mr stein the only director who is also a transdigm employee does not receive any director fees mr howley also does not receive any director fees as he received an option grant in connection with the early termination of his employment agreement and transition to nonexecutive chairman 

compensation for nonemployee directors for 2021 was as follows 

• an annual retainer fee of 75000 with such fee being paid at the option of each director either in cash or shares of transdigm’s common stock paid semiannually in arrears typically in march and september no additional board or committee meeting fees were paid 

• an additional retainer of 15000 to the chairman of the audit committee paid semiannually in arrears 

• an additional retainer of 5000 to the chairmen of the compensation and nominating  governance committees paid semiannually in arrears 

historically every two years transdigm made a grant of stock options to each outside director to cover equity compensation for a twoyear period no option grants were made in fiscal 2021 in 2020 the grant was valued at 400000 on a blackscholes basis and covered compensation for fiscal 2020 and 2021 granted on the same terms and conditions as those granted to transdigm employees including vesting over five years the terms of the options are discussed in greater detail under “executive compensation – equity based incentives–options” commencing in fiscal 2022 outside directors other than mr howley will instead receive a grant of stock options annually valued at 200000 on a blackscholes basis this will help avoid investor confusion over the magnitude of director compensation nonemployee directors must maintain equity in transdigm ie stock or vested inthemoney options equal to at least 250000 with a grace period to reach such limit the following table sets forth the compensation paid to transdigm’s nonemployee directors during fiscal 2021 in dollars 





1 messrs barr dunn graff hennessy laubenthal mccullough and small and ms santana and ms cronin elected to receive all of their semiannual board retainer fees as stock ms cronin was appointed to the board on june 30 2021 and received onequarter of the annual retainer the shares were issued based on a value established on march 15 2021 and september 15 2021 on which dates the last closing price of the common stock on the new york stock exchange were 61746 and 61296 respectively

3 ms cronin joined the board on june 30 2021 

compensation risk 

the compensation committee has reviewed and evaluated the incentive compensation policies and practices that cover all employees on the basis of that review the compensation committee does not believe that its compensation policies and practices pose risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on transdigm 

compensation committee interlocks and insider participation 

messrs graff dunn hennessy and small comprise the compensation committee there are no compensation committee interlocks 

compensation committee report 

the compensation committee has reviewed and discussed with transdigm management the compensation discussion and analysis set forth in this item 11 based on the review and discussions noted above the committee recommended to the board of directors that the compensation discussion and analysis be included in this form 10ka for filing with the securities and exchange commission

 item 1 business 

the company 

td group through its whollyowned subsidiary transdigm inc is a leading global designer producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers we estimate that approximately 90 of our net sales for fiscal year 2021 were generated by proprietary products for fiscal year 2021 we estimate that we generated approximately 80 of our net sales from products in which we are the sole source provider 

most of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue once our parts are designed into and sold on a new aircraft we generate net sales from aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft which is generally estimated to be approximately 25 to 30 years a typical platform can be produced for 20 to 30 years giving us an estimated product life cycle in excess of 50 years we estimate that approximately 50 of our net sales in fiscal year 2021 were generated from aftermarket net sales the vast majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets historically these aftermarket revenues have produced a higher gross profit and have been more stable than net sales to original equipment manufacturers “oems” 

products 

we primarily design produce and supply highly engineered proprietary aerospace components with significant aftermarket content we seek to develop highly customized products to solve specific needs for aircraft operators and manufacturers we attempt to differentiate ourselves based on engineering service and manufacturing capabilities we typically choose not to compete for nonproprietary “build to print” business because it frequently offers lower margins than proprietary products we believe that our products have strong brand names within the industry and that we have a reputation for high quality reliability and strong customer support 

our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products that we offer to our customers our major product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and engine technology specialized pumps and valves power conditioning devices specialized acdc electric motors and generators batteries and chargers engineered latching and locking devices engineered rods engineered connectors and elastomer sealing solutions databus and power controls cockpit security components and systems specialized and advanced cockpit displays engineered audio radio and antenna systems specialized lavatory components seat belts and safety restraints engineered and customized interior surfaces and related components advanced sensor products switches and relay panels thermal protection and insulation lighting and control technology parachutes high performance hoists winches and lifting devices and cargo loading handling and delivery systems each of these product offerings is composed of many individual products that are typically customized to meet the needs of a particular aircraft platform or customer 

covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has continued to cause a significant adverse impact on our net sales net income and ebitda as defined when compared to prepandemic levels covid19 was first reported in december 2019 and since being declared as a pandemic by the world health organization in march 2020 has dramatically impacted the global health and economic environment including millions of confirmed cases business slowdowns or shutdowns government challenges and market volatility the commercial aerospace industry in particular has been significantly disrupted both domestically and internationally by the pandemic the pandemic has resulted in governments around the world implementing stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus including quarantines “shelter in place” and “stay at home” orders travel restrictions business curtailments and other measures as a result demand for travel declined at a rapid pace beginning in the second half of fiscal 2020 and has remained depressed compared to prepandemic levels however commercial air travel has increasingly shown signs of recovery in recent months with increasing air traffic primarily in certain domestic markets the recovery in international commercial air travel has been slower with international travel only slightly recovered from covid19 pandemic lows the exact pace and timing of the commercial air travel recovery remains uncertain and is expected to continue to be uneven depending on factors such as trends in the number of covid19 infections eg impact of new variants of covid19 resurfacing the continued efficacy of vaccines particularly against any newlyemerging variants of covid19 and easing of quarantines and travel restrictions among other factors we currently expect covid19 to continue to cause an adverse impact on our net sales net income and ebitda as defined compared to prepandemic levels into fiscal 2022 

within the united states our business has been designated as “essential” which has allowed us to continue to serve our customers throughout the covid19 pandemic nonetheless the pandemic has disrupted our operations our ability to continue to manufacture products is highly dependent on our ability to maintain the safety and health of our factory employees the ability of our employees to work has been and may again be significantly impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to covid19 while we are following the requirements of governmental authorities and taking preventative and protective measures to prioritize the safety of our employees these measures are not always successful and we have been required at times to temporarily close facilities or take other partial shutdown measures furthermore in light of enacted and any additional reductions in our workforce as a result of declines in our business caused by the covid19 pandemic we cannot assure that we will be able to rehire our workforce as our business continues to recover finally though this appears to be lower risk at the present time our acquisition strategy which is a key element of our overall business strategy may be impacted by our efforts to maintain the company’s cash liquidity position in response to the covid19 pandemic depending on the duration of the pandemic and its impact on our cash flows 

although we remain cautiously optimistic that the global vaccination efforts will continue to progress and positively influence the markets we serve the magnitude of the impact of covid19 remains unpredictable and we continue to anticipate potential supply chain disruptions employee absenteeism and shortterm suspensions of manufacturing facilities and additional health and safety costs related to the covid19 pandemic that could unfavorably impact our business longerterm because of these factors it is difficult to forecast a precise impact on the company’s future results 

segments 

the company’s businesses are organized and managed in three reporting segments power  control airframe and nonaviation 

the power  control segment includes operations that primarily develop produce and market systems and components that predominately provide power to or control power of the aircraft utilizing electronic fluid power and mechanical motion control technologies major product offerings include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and engine technology specialized pumps and valves power conditioning devices specialized acdc electric motors and generators batteries and chargers databus and power controls advanced sensor products switches and relay panels high performance hoists winches and lifting devices and cargo loading handling and delivery systems primary customers of this segment are engine and power system and subsystem suppliers airlines third party maintenance suppliers military buying agencies and repair depots products are sold in the original equipment and aftermarket market channels

the nonaviation segment includes operations that primarily develop produce and market products for nonaviation markets major product offerings include seat belts and safety restraints for ground transportation applications mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls for space applications hydraulicelectromechanical actuators and fuel valves for landbased gas turbines and refueling systems for heavy equipment used in mining construction and other industries and turbine controls for the energy and oil and gas markets primary customers of this segment are offroad vehicle suppliers and subsystem suppliers child restraint system suppliers satellite and space system suppliers manufacturers of heavy equipment used in mining construction and other industries and turbine original equipment manufacturers gas pipeline builders and electric utilities 

the primary measurement used by management to review and assess the operating performance of each segment is ebitda as defined the company defines ebitda as defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization plus certain nonoperating items recorded as corporate expenses including noncash compensation charges incurred in connection with the company’s stock incentive plans restructuring costs related to the companys cost reduction measures in response to the covid19 pandemic foreign currency gains and losses acquisitionintegration costs acquisition and divestiture transactionrelated expenses and refinancing costs covid19 restructuring costs represent actions taken by the company to reduce its workforce to align with customer demand as well as incremental costs related to the pandemic that are not expected to recur once the pandemic has subsided and are clearly separable from normal operations eg additional cleaning and disinfecting of facilities by contractors above and beyond normal requirements personal protective equipment acquisition and divestiturerelated costs represent accounting adjustments to inventory associated with acquisitions of businesses and product lines that were charged to cost of sales when the inventory was sold costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses and product lines into the company’s operations facility relocation costs and other acquisitionrelated costs transactionrelated costs for both acquisitions and divestitures comprising deal fees legal financial and tax diligence expenses and valuation costs that are required to be expensed as incurred and other acquisition accounting adjustments 

for financial information about our segments refer to note 17 “segments” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

sales and marketing 

consistent with our overall strategy our sales and marketing organization is structured to continually develop technical solutions that meet customer needs in particular we attempt to focus on products and programs that will lead to highmargin repeatable sales in the aftermarket 

we have structured our sales efforts along our major product offerings assigning a business unit manager to certain products each business unit manager is expected to grow the sales and profitability of the products for which he or she is responsible and to achieve the targeted annual level of bookings net sales new business and profitability for such products the business unit managers are assisted by account managers and sales engineers who are responsible for covering major oem and aftermarket accounts account managers and sales engineers are expected to be familiar with the personnel organization and needs of specific customers to achieve total bookings and new business goals for each account and together with the business unit managers to determine when additional resources are required at customer locations most of our sales personnel are evaluated in part on their bookings and their ability to identify and obtain new business opportunities 

though typically performed by employees the account manager function may be performed by independent representatives depending on the specific customer product and geographic location we also use a number of distributors to provide logistical support as well as serve as a primary customer contact with certain smaller accounts boeing distribution services inc satair as a subsidiary of airbus sas and seal dynamics a subsidiary of heico corporation among others are our major distributors 

manufacturing and engineering 

we maintain approximately 100 manufacturing facilities most of our manufacturing facilities are comprised of manufacturing distribution and engineering functions and most facilities have certain administrative functions including management sales and finance we continually strive to improve productivity and reduce costs including rationalization of operations developing improved control systems that allow for accurate accounting and reporting investing in equipment tooling information systems and implementing broadbased employee training programs management believes that our manufacturing systems and equipment contribute to our ability to compete by permitting us to meet the rigorous tolerances and cost sensitive price structure of aircraft component customers 

we attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by producing uniquely engineered products with high quality and timely delivery our engineering costs are recorded in cost of sales and in selling and administrative expenses within our consolidated statements of income research and development costs are recorded in selling and administrative expenses within our consolidated statements of income the aggregate of engineering expense and research and development expense represents approximately 11 of our operating units’ aggregate costs or approximately 6 of our consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2021 our proprietary products and particularly our new product initiatives are designed by our engineers and are intended to serve the needs of the aircraft component industry these proprietary designs must withstand the extraordinary conditions and stresses that will be endured by products during use and meet the rigorous demands of our customers’ tolerance and quality requirements 

we use sophisticated equipment and procedures to comply with quality requirements specifications and federal aviation administration “faa” and oem requirements we perform a variety of testing procedures as required by our customers such as testing under different temperature humidity and altitude levels flammability testing shock and vibration testing and xray fluorescent measurement these procedures together with other customer approved techniques for document process and quality control are used throughout our manufacturing facilities refer to note 3 “summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein with respect to the total costs of research and development 

customers 

we predominantly serve customers in the commercial regional business jet and general aviation aftermarket which accounted for approximately 23 of our net sales for fiscal year 2021 the commercial aerospace oem market comprising large commercial transport manufacturers and regional and business jet manufacturers which accounted for approximately 20 of our net sales for fiscal year 2021 and the defense market which accounted for approximately 50 of our net sales for fiscal year 2021 nonaerospace net sales comprised approximately 7 of our net sales for fiscal year 2021 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic and its adverse impact on air travel worldwide the commercial aerospace industry has been significantly disrupted the defense aerospace market has been impacted by the covid19 pandemic to a lesser extent than the commercial aerospace market due to certain supply chain disruptions as well as “stay at home” orders quarantines etc impacting the government procurement workforce which has slowed production andor orders the significant adverse impact of the covid19 pandemic on the commercial aerospace market channels has led to the defense market comprising a greater percentage of our net sales in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 compared to prepandemic historical levels in fiscal years 2015 through 2019 representing the five fiscal years prior to the pandemic defense market net sales ranged from 29 to 37 of total net sales as the commercial aerospace industry recovers from the disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic we would expect defense market net sales to account for a percentage of total net sales that is relatively in line with our historical levels prior to the covid19 pandemic 

our customers include 1 distributors of aerospace components 2 worldwide commercial airlines including national and regional airlines 3 large commercial transport and regional and business aircraft oems 4 various armed forces of the united states and friendly foreign governments 5 defense oems 6 system suppliers and 7 various other industrial customers our top ten customers for fiscal year 2021 accounted for approximately 42 of our net sales products supplied to many of our customers are used on multiple platforms none of our customers individually accounted for greater than 10 of our net sales for fiscal year 2021 

the markets in which we sell our products are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced upswings and downturns the demand for our commercial aftermarket parts and services depends on among other things the breadth of our installed oem base revenue passenger miles “rpms” the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet the percentage of the worldwide fleet that is in warranty and airline profitability the demand for defense products is specifically dependent on government budget trends military campaigns and political pressures 

competition 

the niche markets within the aerospace industry that we serve are relatively fragmented and we face several competitors for many of the products and services we provide due to the global nature of the commercial aircraft industry competition in these categories comes from both us and foreign companies competitors in our product offerings range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privatelyheld entities with only one or two components in their entire product portfolios 

we compete on the basis of engineering manufacturing and marketing high quality products which we believe meet or exceed the performance and maintenance requirements of our customers consistent and timely delivery and superior customer service and support the industry’s stringent regulatory certification and technical requirements and the investments necessary in the development and certification of products may create disincentives for potential new competitors for certain products if customers receive products that meet or exceed expectations and performance standards we believe that they will have a reduced incentive to certify another supplier because of the cost and time of the technical design and testing certification process in addition we believe that the availability dependability and safety of our products are reasons for our customers to continue longterm supplier relationships 

government contracts 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to united states government “us government” agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 1 suspend us from receiving new contracts 2 terminate existing contracts 3 reduce the value of existing contracts 4 audit our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs 5 control and potentially prohibit the export of our products and 6 seek repayment of contract related payments under certain circumstances violations of government procurement laws could result in civil or criminal penalties 

governmental regulation 

the commercial aircraft component industry is highly regulated by the faa in the united states and by the joint aviation authorities in europe and other agencies throughout the world while the military aircraft component industry is governed by military quality specifications we and the components we manufacture are required to be certified by one or more of these entities or agencies and in many cases by individual oems in order to engineer and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models 

we must also satisfy the requirements of our customers including oems and airlines that are subject to faa regulations and provide these customers with products and services that comply with the government regulations applicable to commercial flight operations in addition the faa requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components we believe that we currently satisfy or exceed these maintenance standards in our repair and overhaul services we also maintain several faaapproved repair stations 

in addition our businesses are subject to many other laws and requirements typically applicable to manufacturers and exporters without limiting the foregoing sales of many of our products that will be used on aircraft owned by foreign entities are subject to compliance with export control laws and the manufacture of our products and the operations of our businesses including the disposal of hazardous wastes are subject to compliance with applicable environmental laws 

market channels 

the commercial aerospace industry including the aftermarket and oem markets is impacted by the health of the global economy and geopolitical events around the world the commercial aerospace industry in particular has been significantly disrupted both domestically and internationally by the pandemic the commercial aerospace industry experienced a steep decline in rpms beginning in the second half of our fiscal 2020 due to the pandemic’s impact on worldwide air travel demand and rpms remained depressed in fiscal 2021 when compared to prepandemic levels also as a result of the pandemic and decreased demand in commercial air travel the commercial oem sector has experienced reductions in commercial oem production rates including reductions at the two largest commercial oems the boeing company “boeing” and airbus sas “airbus” although the commercial aerospace industry has shown signs of recovery in recent months with increasing commercial air travel demand and both boeing and airbus disclosing potential oem production rate increases for calendar 2022 the impact of covid19 continues to be fluid and the shape and speed of the recovery for the commercial aerospace industry remains uncertain 

the defense aerospace market is dependent on government budget constraints the timing of orders political pressures and the extent of global conflicts it is not necessarily affected by general economic conditions that affect the commercial aerospace industry the defense aerospace market has been impacted by the covid19 pandemic to a lesser extent than the commercial aerospace market due to certain supply chain disruptions as well as “stay at home” orders quarantines etc impacting the government procurement workforce which has slowed production andor orders also government funding reprioritization such as shifting funds to efforts to combat the impact of the pandemic provides for uncertainty 

historically our presence in both the commercial aerospace and military sectors of the aerospace industry has served to mitigate the impact on our business of any specific industry risk we service a diversified customer base in the commercial and military aerospace industry and we provide components to a diverse installed base of aircraft which mitigates our exposure to any individual airframe platform at times declines in net sales in one channel have been offset by increased net sales in another channel however due to differences between the profitability of our products sold to oem and aftermarket customers variation in product mix can cause variation in gross profit 

outside of the significant market disruption caused by covid19 there are many shortterm factors including customer inventory level adjustments unannounced changes in order patterns strikes facility shutdowns caused by fires hurricanes health crises or other incidents and mergers and acquisitions that can cause shortterm disruptions in our quarterly shipment patterns as compared to previous quarters and the same periods in prior years as such it can be difficult to determine longerterm trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons to normalize for shortterm fluctuations we tend to look at our performance over several quarters or years of activity rather than discrete shortterm periods there are also fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering and delivery requests from quartertoquarter as well as variations in product mix from quartertoquarter that may cause positive or negative variations in gross profit since commercial aftermarket net sales have historically produced a higher gross profit than net sales to commercial oems again in many instances these are timing events between quarters and must be balanced with macro aerospace industry indicators 

commercial aftermarket 

the key market factors in the commercial aftermarket include worldwide rpms and the size and activity level of the worldwide fleet of aircraft and the percentage of the fleet that is in warranty as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the stringent measures implemented to help control the spread of the virus demand for air travel declined at a rapid pace and has remained depressed compared to prepandemic levels the reduced demand has led to a significant reduction in flights and an increase in parked aircraft certain airlines have also retired a portion of their fleets certain markets have reopened some of which have experienced a resurgence of covid19 cases while others particularly international markets remain closed or are enforcing extended quarantines although worldwide rpms are still significantly lower than prepandemic levels worldwide rpms have been steadily recovering commercial air travel has increasingly shown signs of recovery in recent months with increasing air traffic primarily in certain domestic markets and parked aircraft returning to service the pace of the international air travel traffic recovery has been slower and international rpms have only slightly recovered from pandemic lows there is potential for improved international recovery moving forward as vaccinations increase worldwide and governmentimposed travel restrictions are eased current industry consensus indicates that worldwide rpms will continue to recover in 2022 however the impact of covid19 on the commercial aerospace market is fluid and continues to evolve overall the timing and pace of the commercial aftermarket recovery remains uncertain and may not return to prepandemic levels until 2023 or beyond 

commercial oem market 

the commercial oem market declined in fiscal 2021 primarily due to the continued impact of the covid19 pandemic our commercial transport oem shipments and revenues generally run ahead of boeing and airbus airframe delivery schedules as a result and consistent with prior years our fiscal 2022 shipments will be a function of among other things the estimated 2022 and 2023 commercial airframe production rates we have been experiencing decreased net sales across the commercial oem sector driven primarily by the decrease in production rates by boeing and airbus related to reduced demand in the commercial air travel from the covid19 pandemic we expect demand for our commercial oem products to continue to be reduced in the shortterm however the commercial oem market is showing initial signs of recovery with airlines returning to the commercial oems to take planes or place orders along with boeing and airbus disclosing potential oem production rate increases for calendar 2022 current industry consensus indicates production rates will continue to be lower than prepandemic historic levels but are expected to gradually increase over the next several years however the duration of the pandemic is unclear and the pace of the recovery of the commercial oem market remains uncertain and continues to evolve 

our businesses continually seek to provide solutions for our customers and others in the commercial aerospace industry for example as a result of the covid19 pandemic many of our businesses have taken the opportunity to explore new business opportunities by working on developing highly engineered solutions for emerging needs arising from the pandemic and providing product offerings that could help the industry recover product solutions currently developed or being explored include antiviral or antimicrobial technology air purification and touchless technologies among others 

defense 

our military business fluctuates from yeartoyear and is dependent to a degree on government budget constraints the timing of orders macro and micro dynamics with respect to the us department of defense “dod” procurement policy and the extent of global conflicts also government funding reprioritization such as shifting funds to efforts to combat the impact of the pandemic provides for further unpredictability in the military spending outlook the defense aerospace market has been impacted by the covid19 pandemic to a lesser extent than the commercial aerospace market any unfavorable impact on our defense aerospace business related to the covid19 pandemic was primarily during fiscal 2020 due to certain supply chain disruptions as well as “stay at home” orders quarantines etc impacting the government procurement workforce which slowed production andor orders uncertainty remains in the covid19 pandemic recovery but we do not currently expect any significant unfavorable impact on our defense aerospace business related to the covid19 pandemic for a variety of reasons the military spending outlook is very uncertain for planning purposes we assume that militaryrelated net sales of our types of products to be flatter in future years over the recent higher levels 

in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 the defense market channel comprises a greater percentage of net sales than historical comparisons due to the significant adverse impact of the covid19 pandemic on our commercial aftermarket channel and commercial oem market channel in fiscal years 2015 through 2019 representing the five fiscal years prior to the pandemic defense market net sales ranged from 29 to 37 of total net sales as the commercial aerospace industry recovers from the disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic we would expect defense market net sales to account for a percentage of total net sales that is relatively in line with our historical levels prior to the covid19 pandemic 

raw materials 

we require the use of various raw materials in our manufacturing processes we purchase a variety of manufactured component parts from various suppliers we also purchase replacement parts which are utilized in our various repair and overhaul operations at times we concentrate our orders among a few suppliers in order to strengthen our supplier relationships most of our raw materials and component parts are generally available from multiple suppliers at competitive prices 

the covid19 pandemic has disrupted the global supply chain to a certain extent and availability of raw materials particularly electronic parts because we strive to limit the volume of raw materials and component parts on hand our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers or alternative raw materials or component parts the lengthy and expensive faa and oem certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier raw material or component part 

intellectual property 

we have various trade secrets proprietary information trademarks trade names patents copyrights and other intellectual property rights which we believe in the aggregate but not individually are important to our business the companys products are manufactured marketed and sold using a portfolio of patents trademarks licenses and other forms of intellectual property some of which expire in the future the company develops and acquires new intellectual property on an ongoing basis based on the broad scope of the company’s product lines management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

environmental matters 

our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things discharges of pollutants into the air and water the generation handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees environmental laws and regulations may require that the company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations certain facilities and thirdparty sites utilized by the company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws the company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws 

for information regarding environmental accruals refer to note 15 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein compliance with federal state local and foreign environmental laws during fiscal 2021 had no material impact on our capital expenditures or results of operations based upon consideration of currently available information we believe liabilities for environmental matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements but we cannot assure that material environmental liabilities may not arise in the future for further information on environmentalrelated risks including climate change refer to item 1a “risk factors” 

employees 

as of september 30 2021 we had approximately 13300 fulltime parttime and temporary employees approximately 16 of our fulltime and parttime employees are represented by labor unions collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire at various dates ranging from december 2021 to december 2024 

talent development 

we consider our employees to be our most valuable asset the development attraction and retention of employees is a critical success factor for transdigm and its operating units for succession planning and sustaining our three core value drivers obtaining profitable new business continually improving our cost structure and providing highly engineered valueadded products to customers to support the advancement of our employees we offer training and development programs encouraging advancement from within and continue to fill our team with strong and experienced management talent we leverage both formal and informal programs to identify foster and retain top talent at both the corporate and operating unit level

the company’s management development program “mdp” identifies new talent and prepares them for success within our organization the company actively recruits for mdp candidates at colleges and universities across the us to ensure we are reaching a large and diverse pool of candidates the program hires recent master of business administration graduates who work for three eightmonth stints at a selection of operating units program participants gain experience in developing manufacturing and selling aerospace components with the intent of becoming fully immersed in the operations of our business once the program is complete mdp participants are better equipped with the knowledge and experience needed to excel as a manager at the company our goal for successful mdp participants is to hire them on a fulltime basis at an operating unit upon completion of the program 

transdigm’s executive team also mentors rising talent on a more informal basis this informal mentorship achieves a number of goals including accelerating the development of top performers increasing organizational learning and improving employee performance and retention the executive team also commits substantial time to evaluating the bench strength of our leadership and working with our leadership to improve their performance 

transdigm university mdp various internship programs and informal mentoring demonstrates the company’s ongoing commitment and initiatives towards accelerating the development of our future leaders

health and safety 

our commitment to manufacturing the safest highest quality products is matched by our commitment to keeping our employees healthy and safe as they work to produce these products we are dedicated to building designing maintaining and operating our facilities to effectively manage process safety and other hazards and to minimize risks we also seek to empower and support our employees to prevent accidents and promote a safe environment we expect personnel to report and communicate risks potential hazards incidents and near hits so that they can be investigated and appropriate action can be taken to prevent future issues to elevate the importance of this we began to require our operating units to individually report on environmental health and safety matters monthly to the executive team 

since the early days of the covid19 pandemic we have been following guidance from the world health organization and the us center for disease control to protect employees and prevent the spread of the virus within all of our facilities globally the company has taken various steps to facilitate access to vaccines for our employees in accordance with federal guidelines and state and local vaccination plans 

seasonality 

we do not believe our net sales are subject to significant seasonal variation however our net sales have generally been lower in the first quarter of our fiscal year compared to the subsequent quarters due to fewer working days resulting from the observance of various holidays

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below are material risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business and financial condition and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements contained in this report additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition 

risks related to our strategy 

we face risks related to the current covid19 pandemic and other health pandemics epidemics and outbreaks  

the covid19 pandemic is continuing to cause an adverse impact on our employees operations supply chain and distribution system and the longterm impact to our business remains unknown this is due to the numerous uncertainties that have risen from the pandemic including the severity of the disease the duration of the outbreak the likelihood of resurgences of the outbreak including due to the emergence and spread of variants actions that may be taken by governmental authorities in response to the disease the timing distribution efficacy and public acceptance of vaccines and unintended consequences of the foregoing 

the commercial aerospace industry in particular has been significantly disrupted both domestically and internationally by the pandemic the pandemic has resulted in governments around the world implementing stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus including quarantines “shelter in place” and “stay at home” orders travel restrictions business curtailments and other measures as a result demand for travel declined at a rapid pace beginning in the second half of fiscal 2020 and has remained depressed compared to prepandemic levels however commercial air travel has increasingly shown signs of recovery in recent quarters with increasing air traffic primarily in certain domestic markets the recovery in international commercial air travel has been slower with international travel only slightly recovered from covid19 pandemic lows the exact pace and timing of the commercial air travel recovery remains uncertain and is expected to continue to be uneven depending on factors such as trends in the number of covid19 infections eg impact of new variants of covid19 resurfacing the timing distribution efficacy and public acceptance of vaccines and easing of quarantines and travel restrictions among other factors we currently expect covid19 to continue to cause an adverse impact on our net sales net income and ebitda as defined compared to prepandemic levels into 

fiscal 2022 longerterm because the duration of the pandemic is unclear it is difficult to forecast a precise impact on the company’s future results 

the covid19 pandemic has disrupted the global supply chain to a certain extent and availability of raw materials particularly electronic parts because we strive to limit the volume of raw materials and component parts on hand our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers or alternative raw materials or component parts the lengthy and expensive faa and oem certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier raw material or component part 

our ability to continue to manufacture products is highly dependent on our ability to maintain the safety and health of our factory employees the ability of our employees to work has been and may again be significantly impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to covid19 while we are following the requirements of governmental authorities and taking preventative and protective measures to prioritize the safety of our employees these measures are not always successful and we have been required to temporarily close facilities or take other measures furthermore in light of enacted and any additional reductions in our workforce as a result of declines in our business caused by the covid19 pandemic we cannot assure that we will be able to rehire our workforce as our business continues to recover we believe the covid19 pandemic has had and may in the future again have a material and adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows in addition the impact of the covid19 pandemic and any future public health crises that arise could exacerbate the other risks we face 

our business focuses almost exclusively on the aerospace and defense industry 

during a prolonged period of significant market disruption in the aerospace and defense industry such as the adverse impact that the covid19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have on the commercial aerospace market our business may be disproportionately impacted compared to peer companies that are more diversified in the industries they serve in which case a more diversified company may be able to recover more quickly from significant market disruptions such as the covid19 pandemic 

we rely heavily on certain customers for much of our sales 

in fiscal year 2021 no customer individually accounted for 10 or more of the company’s net sales however our top ten customers for fiscal year 2021 accounted for approximately 42 of our net sales in fiscal year 2020 no customer individually accounted for 10 or more of the company’s net sales in fiscal year 2019 one customer individually accounted for approximately 11 of the company’s net sales a material reduction in purchasing by one of our larger customers for any reason including but not limited to the covid19 pandemic general economic or aerospace downturn decreased production strike or resourcing could have a material adverse effect on results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we generally do not have guaranteed future sales of our products further when we enter into fixed price contracts with some of our customers we take the risk for cost overruns 

as is customary in our business we do not generally have longterm contracts with most of our aftermarket customers and therefore do not have guaranteed future sales although we have longterm contracts with many of our oem customers many of those customers may terminate the contracts on short notice and in most cases our customers have not committed to buy any minimum quantity of our products in addition in certain cases we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon the historic purchasing patterns of customers and upon our discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements and this anticipated future volume of orders may not materialize 

we also have entered into multiyear fixedprice contracts with some of our customers pursuant to which we have agreed to perform the work for a fixed price and accordingly realize all the benefit or detriment resulting from any decreases or increases in the costs of making these products sometimes we accept a fixedprice contract for a product that we have not yet produced and this increases the risk of cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product most of our contracts do not permit us to recover increases in raw material prices taxes or labor costs 

we intend to pursue acquisitions our business may be adversely affected if we cannot consummate acquisitions on satisfactory terms or if we cannot effectively integrate acquired operations 

a significant portion of our growth has occurred through acquisitions any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions we intend to pursue acquisitions that we believe will present opportunities consistent with our overall business strategy however we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates to purchase or may be unable to acquire desired businesses or assets on economically acceptable terms or may be unable to receive necessary regulatory approvals or support in addition we may not be able to raise the capital necessary to fund future acquisitions because we may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously we may encounter unforeseen expenses complications and delays including regulatory complications or difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight 

we regularly engage in discussions with respect to potential acquisition and investment opportunities if we consummate an acquisition our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly future acquisitions could result in margin dilution and further likely result in the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest and amortization expenses or periodic impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets as well as significant charges relating to integration costs 

acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect in addition we may not be able to successfully integrate any business we acquire into our existing business the successful integration of new businesses with the most significant recent acquisition being the cobham aero connectivity “cac” acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 depends on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs the successful integration of future acquisitions may also require substantial attention from our senior management and the management of the acquired business which could decrease the time that they have to service attract customers and develop new products and services or attend to other acquisition opportunities 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and could harm our ability to react to changes to our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of september 30 2021 our total indebtedness excluding approximately 31 million of letters of credit outstanding was approximately 20 billion which was 1171 of our total book capitalization 

in addition we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future as of september 30 2021 we had approximately 529 million of unused commitments under our revolving credit facility on october 6 2021 the company repaid 200 million of the revolving credit facility drawn increasing the borrowings available under the revolving commitments to 729 million although our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the various senior secured and senior subordinated notes outstanding the “indentures” contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these qualifications and exceptions could be substantial a breach of any of the covenants or an inability to comply with the required leverage ratio could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the indentures 

an increase in our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to investors for example it could 

• increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions 

• increase the risk we are subjected to downgrade or put on a negative watch by the ratings agencies 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital requirements capital expenditures acquisitions research and development efforts and other general corporate requirements 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 

• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt and 

• limit along with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the documents governing our indebtedness among other things our ability to borrow additional funds make investments and incur liens 

all of our debt under the senior secured credit facility which includes 74 billion in term loans and a revolving credit facility of 760 million bears interest at variable rates primarily based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” for deposits of us dollars accordingly if libor or other variable interest rates increase our debt service expense will also increase in order to mitigate the interest rate risk of these variable rate borrowings we entered into interest rate swap and cap agreements that covers a significant portion of the existing variable rate debt the companys objective is to maintain an allocation of at least 75 fixed rate and 25 variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in nearterm interest rates as of september 30 2021 approximately 86 of our total debt was fixed rate debt for information about our interest rate swap and cap agreements refer to note 21 “derivatives and hedging instruments” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

in 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate libor and other interbank offered rates which have been widely used as reference rates for various securities and financial contracts including loans debt and derivatives however for us dollar libor the relevant date has been deferred to at least june 30 2023 for certain tenors at which time the libor administrator has indicated that it intends to cease publication of us dollar libor despite this deferral the libor administrator has advised that no new contracts using us dollar libor should be entered into after december 31 2021 these actions indicate that the continuation of us dollar libor on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after june 30 2023 moreover it is possible that us dollar libor will be discontinued or modified prior to june 30 2023 in february 2020 in connection with amendment no 7 to the credit agreement we amended our credit agreement to include a provision for the determination of an alternative reference interest rate the discontinuation of libor will also require our derivative agreements to be amended once the alternative interest rate has replaced libor our future interest expense could be impacted 

our indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness including the indentures we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital 

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness including the indentures amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility amounts due under our trade receivable securitization facility “securitization facility” and to fund our operations will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future which to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness including the amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility amounts borrowed under our securitization facility and the indentures or to fund our other liquidity needs if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital we cannot assure that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations the terms of existing or future debt instruments the securitization facility the indentures and the senior secured credit facility may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives in addition any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms and would otherwise adversely affect the indentures 

the terms of the senior secured credit facility and indentures may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

our senior secured credit facility and the indentures contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indentures and may limit their ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests the senior secured credit facility and indentures include covenants restricting among other things the ability of td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indentures to 

• incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock 

• pay distributions on redeem or repurchase our capital stock or redeem or repurchase our subordinated debt 

• make investments 

• sell assets 

• enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us 

• incur or allow to exist liens 

• consolidate merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets 

• engage in transactions with affiliates 

• create unrestricted subsidiaries and 

• engage in certain business activities 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the indentures if any such default occurs the lenders under the senior secured credit facility and the holders of the senior secured and senior subordinated notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder to be immediately due and payable the lenders under the senior secured credit facility also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings in addition following an event of default under the senior secured credit facility the lenders under that facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which includes our available cash and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the senior subordinated notes if the debt under the senior secured credit facility or the senior secured or subordinated notes were to be accelerated we cannot assure that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt 

we are dependent on our executive officers senior management team and highly trained employees and any work stoppage difficulty hiring similar employees or ineffective succession planning could adversely affect our business 

because our products are complicated and highly engineered we depend on an educated and trained workforce historically there has been substantial competition for skilled personnel in the aerospace and defense industry and we could be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled employees we may not be able to fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover or attract and retain qualified personnel 

reduction in force actions such as the actions taken to reduce our workforce to align operations with customer demand as a result of the covid19 pandemic could result in difficulty in rehiring capable employees to refill the positions eliminated as needed once business recovers 

although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory we cannot assure that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory renewal of collective bargaining agreements or that our employee relations will remain stable because we strive to limit the volume of finished goods inventory any work stoppage could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide products to our customers 

in addition our success depends in part on our ability to attract and motivate our senior management and key employees achieving this objective may be difficult due to a variety of factors including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions competitors’ hiring practices and the effectiveness of our compensation programs competition for qualified personnel can be intense i f we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of key personnel senior management and our executive officers including our president chief executive officer and director our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected the company’s board of directors continually monitors this risk and we believe that the company’s succession plan together with our straightforward strategy clear value drivers decentralized nature and the quality of managers running our operating units helps to mitigate this risk 

risks related to our operations 

our sales to manufacturers of aircraft are cyclical and a downturn in sales to these manufacturers may adversely affect us 

our sales to manufacturers of large commercial aircraft such as boeing airbus and related oem suppliers as well as manufacturers of business jets have historically experienced periodic downturns in the past these sales have been affected by airline profitability which is impacted by among other things fuel and labor costs price competition interest rates downturns in the global economy and national and international events in addition sales of our products to manufacturers of business jets are impacted by among other things downturns in the global economy in recent years we have been experiencing decreased sales across the commercial oem sector driven primarily by the decrease in production by boeing and airbus related to reduced demand in the commercial aerospace industry from the covid19 pandemic and also in boeing’s case the 737 max’s grounding and subsequent production slowdown and airlines deferring or cancelling orders downturns adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business is dependent on the availability of certain components and raw materials from suppliers 

our business is affected by the price and availability of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our components our business therefore could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our suppliers such as the destruction of our suppliers’ facilities or their distribution infrastructure a work stoppage or strike by our suppliers’ employees or the failure of our suppliers to provide materials of the requisite quality or by increased costs of such raw materials or components if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers 

the covid19 pandemic has continued to disrupt the global supply chain we currently are experiencing supply shortages and inflationary pressures for certain components and raw materials that are important to our manufacturing process particularly electronic parts expected growth in the global economy may exacerbate these pressures on us and our suppliers and we expect these supply chain challenges and cost impacts to continue for the foreseeable future because we strive to limit the volume of raw materials and component parts on hand our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers or alternative raw materials or component parts the lengthy and expensive faa and oem certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier raw material or component part 

we face significant competition 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry and compete against a number of companies competitors in our product lines are both us and foreign companies and range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privatelyheld entities we believe that our ability to compete depends on high product performance consistent high quality short leadtime and timely delivery competitive pricing superior customer service and support and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs we may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive 

climaterelated regulations designed to address climate change may result in additional compliance costs 

our operations and the products we sell are currently subject to rules limiting emissions and to other climaterelated regulations in certain jurisdictions where we operate the increased prevalence of global climate change concerns may result in new regulations that may negatively impact us our suppliers and customers we are continuing to evaluate short medium and longterm risks related to climate change we cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers in which case the costs of raw materials and component parts could increase 

as a whole because our manufacturing facilities primarily engage in assembly and light manufacturing and because we do not maintain any transportation infrastructure our emissions primarily fall into scope 2 and scope 3 emissions accordingly we do not anticipate any material adverse impact from increased carbon regulation further because of our wide portfolio of hundreds of thousands of products we do not anticipate any material adverse impact from the reliance on a supplier or group of suppliers that may be subject to climate risks however given the political significance and uncertainty around these issues we cannot predict how legislation regulation and increased awareness of these issues will affect our operations and financial condition we continue to evaluate ways to reduce our energy and water consumption and lower our greenhouse gas emissions through energy efficiency measures the purchase of green power and other actions 

our operations depend on our manufacturing facilities which are subject to physical and other risks that could disrupt production 

our operations and those of our customers and suppliers have been and may again be subject to natural disasters climate changerelated events pandemics or other business disruptions which could seriously harm our results of operation and increase our costs and expenses some of our manufacturing facilities are located in regions that may be impacted by severe weather events such as increased storm frequency or severity in the atlantic and fires in hotter and drier climates these could result in potential damage to our physical assets as well as disruptions in manufacturing activities some of our manufacturing facilities are located in areas that may be at risk due to rising sea levels moreover some of our manufacturing facilities are located in areas that could experience decreased access to water due to climate issues 

we are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters including power loss fire explosions floods communications failures terrorist attacks and similar events disruptions could also occur due to healthrelated outbreaks and crises cyberattacks computer or equipment malfunction accidental or intentional operator error or process failures should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms such as our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans be insufficient to recover all costs we could experience a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

operations and sales outside of the united states may be subject to additional risks 

our net sales to foreign customers were approximately 17 billion for the fiscal years ended september 30 2021 and 2020 respectively a number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including global health crises brexit currency fluctuations difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies restrictions on the repatriation of funds change in trade policies tariff regulation difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition issues with the global supply chain can also rise due to some of the aforementioned risks as well as global health crises such as the covid19 pandemic furthermore the company is subject to laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act uk bribery act and similar local antibribery laws which generally prohibit companies and their employees agents and contractors from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure to comply with these laws could subject the company to civil and criminal penalties that could materially adversely affect the company’s results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we are subject to certain unique business risks as a result of supplying equipment and services to the us government 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies whether through direct contracts with the us government or as a subcontractor to customers contracting with the us government are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 

• suspend us from receiving new contracts based on alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations 

• terminate existing contracts 

• revoke required security clearances 

• reduce the value of existing contracts and 

• audit our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs 

most of our us government contracts can be terminated by the us government at its convenience without significant notice termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination 

on contracts for which the price is based on cost the us government may review our costs and performance as well as our accounting and general business practices based on the results of such audits the us government may adjust our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs in addition under us government purchasing regulations some of our costs including most financing costs amortization of intangible assets portions of research and development costs and certain marketing expenses may not be subject to reimbursement 

furthermore even where the price is not based on cost the us government may seek to review our costs to determine whether our pricing is “fair and reasonable” our subsidiaries are periodically subject to pricing reviews and government buying agencies that purchase some of our subsidiaries’ products are periodically subject to audits by the dod office of inspector general “oig” with respect to prices paid for such products in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 we voluntarily refunded 16 million to the us government following an oig audit and another oig audit is underway in addition our defenserelated business has been the subject of an ongoing congressional inquiry by the house oversight committee and release of the current oig audit report may prompt further congressional inquiries pricing reviews and government audits including the audit underway and the congressional inquiries are costly and time consuming for our management and could distract from our ability to effectively manage the business as a result of these reviews audits and inquiries we could be subject to providing further refunds to the us government we could be asked to enter into an arrangement whereby our prices would be based on cost the dod could seek to pursue alternative sources of supply for our parts or the us government could take other adverse actions with respect to our contracts any of those occurrences could lead to a reduction in our revenue from or the profitability of certain of our supply arrangements with certain agencies and buying organizations of the us government further negative publicity relating to the results of any audit inquiry or subsequent hearing or the like could negatively impact our stock price 

if a government inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions including contract termination fines forfeiture of fees suspension of payment and suspension or debarment from doing business with us government agencies any of which could materially adversely affect our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

moreover us government purchasing regulations contain a number of additional operational requirements which do not apply to entities not engaged in government contracting failure to comply with such government contracting requirements could result in civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

our business may be adversely affected if we would lose our government or industry approvals or if more stringent government regulations are enacted or if industry oversight is increased 

the aerospace industry is highly regulated in the us and in other countries in order to sell our products we and the products we manufacture must be certified by the faa the dod and similar agencies in foreign countries and by individual manufacturers if new and more stringent government regulations are adopted or if industry oversight increases we might incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or heightened industry oversight in addition if material authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended our business would be adversely affected 

in addition to the aviation approvals we are at times required to obtain approval from us government agencies to export our products us laws and regulations applicable to us include the arms export control act the international traffic in arms regulations itar the export administration regulations ear and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the united states department of the treasurys office of foreign assets control ofac ear restricts the export of dualuse products and technical data to certain countries while itar restricts the export of defense products technical data and defense services 

failure to obtain approval to export or determination by the us government that we failed to receive required approvals or licenses could eliminate or restrict our ability to sell our products outside the united states and the penalties that could be imposed by the us government for failure to comply with these laws could be significant 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of data protection concerns 

the interpretation and application of data protection laws in the us europe including but not limited to the general data protection regulation the “gdpr” and the california consumer privacy act the “ccpa” and elsewhere are uncertain and evolving it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices complying with these various laws is difficult and could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business further although we have implemented internal controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the gdpr ccpa and other privacyrelated laws rules and regulations collectively the “data protection laws” there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures will enable us to be fully compliant with all data protection laws 

despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data comply with applicable laws rules and regulations and implement data security measures our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches and other data loss including cyberattacks and in fact we have experienced data security incidents that have not had a material impact on our financial results in addition it is not possible to predict the impact on our business of the future loss alteration or misappropriation of information in our possession related to us our employees former employees customers suppliers or others this could lead to negative publicity legal claims theft modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information damage to or inaccessibility of critical systems manufacture of defective products production downtimes operational disruptions and other significant costs which could adversely affect our reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

risks related to legal and regulatory matters 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations 

our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things discharges of pollutants into the air and water the generation handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees environmental laws and regulations may require that the company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations certain facilities and thirdparty sites utilized by subsidiaries of the company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws the company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws 

estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are based on current facts laws regulations and technology these estimates take into consideration the company’s prior experience and professional judgment of the company’s environmental advisors estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination the range of remediation alternatives available evolving remediation standards imprecise engineering evaluations and cost estimates the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 

accordingly as investigations and remediations proceed it is likely that adjustments in the company’s accruals will be necessary to reflect new information the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in a given period based on currently available information however the company does not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition 

we may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings including fair labor standards act and state wage and hour class action lawsuits which may adversely affect our business and financial performance 

from time to time we are involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of business these actions and proceedings may involve claims for among other things compensation for alleged personal injury workers’ compensation employment discrimination or breach of contract in addition we may be subject to class action lawsuits including those involving allegations of violations of consumer product statutes or the fair labor standards act and state wage and hour laws due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions or proceedings the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions is difficult to assess or quantify as plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts in these types of lawsuits and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition plaintiffs in many types of actions may seek punitive damages civil penalties consequential damages or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief these proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves the ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement mediation or court judgment could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we could be adversely affected if one of our products cause an aircraft to crash 

our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft product that we have designed manufactured or serviced while we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future product liability claims in the event of product liability claims our insurers may attempt to deny coverage or any coverage we have may not be adequate we also may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost any liability not covered by insurance or for which third party indemnification is not available could result in significant liability to us 

in addition a crash caused by one of our products could damage our reputation for quality products we believe our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting a provider of aircraft products if a crash were to be caused by one of our products or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected 

risks related to financial matters 

we have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets which may never generate the returns we expect 

mergers and acquisitions have resulted in significant increases in identifiable intangible assets and goodwill identifiable intangible assets which primarily include trademarks trade names customer relationships and technology were approximately 28 billion at september 30 2021 representing approximately 14 of our total assets goodwill recognized in accounting for the mergers and acquisitions was approximately 86 billion at september 30 2021 representing approximately 44 of our total assets we may never realize the full value of our identifiable intangible assets and goodwill and to the extent we were to determine that our identifiable intangible assets or our goodwill were impaired within the meaning of applicable accounting standards we would be required to writeoff the amount of any impairment 

we may be subject to risks relating to changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and various nonus jurisdictions the company’s domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions the company’s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the company’s effective tax rate as a result of changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets challenges by tax authorities or changes in tax laws or regulations in addition the amount of income taxes paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company’s tax liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

we do not regularly declare and pay quarterly or annual cash dividends on our stock 

notwithstanding special cash dividends of which the most recent declaration by the company’s board of directors occurred on december 20 2019 in the amount of 3250 per outstanding share of common stock and cash dividend equivalent payments on options granted under its equity compensation plans we do not anticipate declaring regular quarterly or annual cash dividends on our common stock or any other equity security in the foreseeable future 

the amounts that may be available to us to pay future special cash dividends are restricted under our debt and other agreements any payment of special cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations earnings capital requirements financial condition future prospects contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors therefore shareholders should not rely on regular quarterly or annual dividend income from shares of our common stock and should not rely on special dividends with any regularity or at all 

general risks 

our commercial business is sensitive to the number of flight hours that our customers’ planes spend aloft the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and our customers’ profitability these items are in turn affected by general economic and geopolitical and other worldwide conditions 

our commercial business is directly affected by among other factors changes in rpms the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet the percentage of the fleet that is outofwarranty and changes in the profitability of the commercial airline industry rpms and airline profitability have historically been correlated with the general economic environment although national and international events also play a key role for example in addition to the current covid19 pandemic and the adverse impact it has had on the airline industry past examples in which the airline industry has been negatively affected include downturns in the global economy higher fuel prices increased security concerns among airline customers following the events of september 11 2001 the severe acute respiratory syndrome “sars” epidemic and conflicts abroad additional examples include future geopolitical or other worldwide events such as war terrorist acts or additional worldwide infectious disease outbreaks 

in addition global market and economic conditions have been challenging due to turbulence in the us and international markets and economies and have prolonged declines in business and consumer spending as a result of the substantial reduction in airline traffic resulting from the aforementioned events the airline industry incurred large losses and financial difficulties some carriers have also parked or retired a portion of their fleets and have reduced workforces and flights during periods of reduced airline profitability some airlines may delay purchases of spare parts preferring instead to deplete existing inventories and delay refurbishments and discretionary spending if demand for spare parts decreases there would be a decrease in demand for certain of our products an adverse change in demand could impact our results of operations collection of accounts receivable and our expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses which may adversely impact our financial condition and access to capital markets 

us military spending is dependent upon the us defense budget 

the military and defense market is significantly dependent upon government budget trends particularly the dod budget in addition to normal business risks our supply of products to the us government is subject to unique risks largely beyond our control dod budgets could be negatively impacted by several factors including but not limited to a change in defense spending policy as a result of the presidential election or otherwise the us government’s budget deficits spending priorities eg allocating more spending to combat the effects of the covid19 pandemic the cost of sustaining the us military presence internationally and possible political pressure to reduce us government military spending each of which could cause the dod budget to remain unchanged or to decline a significant decline in us military expenditures could result in a reduction in the amount of our products sold to the various agencies and buying organizations of the us government 

our stock price may be volatile and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 

there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities which is unrelated to the operating performance of the companies issuing the securities these market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock shareholders may not be able to sell their shares at or above the purchase price due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock such changes could be caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects including possible changes due to the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry and other factors such as fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering which could cause shortterm swings in profit margins or such changes could be unrelated to our operating performance such as changes in market conditions affecting the stock market generally or the stocks of aerospace companies or changes in the outlook for our common stock such as changes to or the confidence in our business strategy changes to or confidence in our management or expectations for future growth of the company global health crises such as the covid19 pandemic could also cause significant volatility in the market price

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with td group’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report the following discussion may contain predictions estimates and other forwardlooking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties including those discussed under the heading entitled “risk factors” included elsewhere in this report these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 

overview 

for fiscal year 2021 we generated net sales of 4798 million gross profit of 2513 million or 524 of net sales and net income attributable to td group of 680 million the covid19 pandemic has continued to cause a significant adverse impact on our net sales net income and ebitda as defined when compared to prepandemic levels historically and as our business continues to recover from the pandemic we believe we have achieved steady longterm growth in sales and improvements in operating performance since our formation in 1993 due to our competitive strengths and through execution of our valuedriven operating strategy more specifically focusing our businesses on our valuedriven operating strategy of obtaining profitable new business carefully controlling the cost structure and pricing our highly engineered valueadded products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so has historically resulted in improvements in gross profit and income from operations over the longterm 

our selective acquisition strategy has also contributed to the growth of our business the integration of certain acquisitions into our existing businesses combined with implementing our proven operating strategy has historically resulted in improvements in the financial performance of the acquired business 

we believe our key competitive strengths include 

large and growing installed product base with aftermarket revenue stream we provide components to a large and growing installed base of aircraft to which we supply aftermarket products we estimate that our products are installed on over 100000 commercial transport regional transport military and general aviation fixed wing turbine aircraft and rotary wing aircraft 

diversified revenue base we believe that our diversified revenue base reduces our dependence on any particular product platform or market channel and has been a significant factor in maintaining our financial performance our products are installed on almost all of the major commercial aircraft platforms now in production we expect to continue to develop new products for military and commercial applications as a result of the covid19 pandemic many of our businesses have taken the opportunity to explore new business opportunities by working on developing highly engineered solutions for emerging needs arising from the pandemic product solutions currently being explored include antiviral or antimicrobial technology air purification and touchless technologies among others 

barriers to entry  we believe that the niche nature of our markets the industry’s stringent regulatory and certification requirements the large number of products that we sell and the investments necessary to develop and certify products create potential disincentives to competition for certain products 

our business strategy is made up of two key elements 1 a valuedriven operating strategy focused around our three core value drivers and 2 a selective acquisition strategy 

valuedriven operating strategy our three core value drivers are 

• obtaining profitable new business we attempt to obtain profitable new business by using our technical expertise and application skill and our detailed knowledge of our customer base and the individual niche markets in which we operate we have regularly been successful in identifying and developing both aftermarket and oem products to drive our growth 

• improving our cost structure we are committed to maintaining and continuously improving our lean cost structure through detailed attention to the cost of each of the products that we offer and our organizational structure with a focus on reducing the cost of each 

• providing highly engineered valueadded products to customers we focus on the engineering manufacturing and marketing of a broad range of highly engineered niche products that we believe provide value to our customers we believe we have been consistently successful in communicating to our customers the value of our products this has generally enabled us to price our products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so 

selective acquisition strategy we selectively pursue the acquisition of proprietary aerospace component businesses when we see an opportunity to create value through the application of our three core valuedriven operating strategies the aerospace industry in particular remains highly fragmented with many of the companies in the industry being small private businesses or small noncore operations of larger businesses we have significant experience among our management team in executing acquisitions and integrating acquired businesses into our company and culture as of the date of this report we have successfully acquired approximately 86 businesses and product lines since our formation in 1993 many of these acquisitions have been integrated into an existing transdigm production facility which enables a higher production capacity utilization which in turn improves gross profit levels due to the ability to spread the fixed manufacturing overhead costs over higher production volume in the case of larger acquisitions that consists of multiple business units such as the esterline acquisition we may pursue opportunities to divest certain acquired business units that are not in line with our longterm acquisition strategy 

acquisitions and divestitures during the most recent three fiscal years are described in note 2 “acquisitions and divestitures” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

impact of the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic is continuing to cause an adverse impact on our employees operations supply chain and distribution system and the longterm impact to our business remains unknown this is due to the numerous uncertainties that have risen from the pandemic including the severity of the disease the duration of the outbreak the likelihood of resurgences of the outbreak including due to the emergence and spread of variants actions that may be taken by governmental authorities in response to the disease the continued efficacy and public acceptance of vaccines and unintended consequences of the foregoing 

the commercial aerospace industry in particular has been significantly disrupted both domestically and internationally by the pandemic the pandemic has resulted in governments around the world implementing stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus including quarantines “shelter in place” and “stay at home” orders travel restrictions business curtailments and other measures as a result demand for travel declined at a rapid pace beginning in the second half of fiscal 2020 and has remained depressed compared to prepandemic levels however commercial air travel has increasingly shown signs of recovery in recent months with increasing air traffic primarily in certain domestic markets the recovery in international commercial air travel has been slower with international travel only slightly recovered from covid19 pandemic lows the exact pace and timing of the commercial air travel recovery remains uncertain and is expected to continue to be uneven depending on factors such as trends in the number of covid19 infections eg impact of new variants of covid19 resurfacing the continued efficacy and public acceptance of vaccines and easing of quarantines and travel restrictions among other factors we currently expect covid19 to continue to cause an adverse impact on our net sales net income and ebitda as defined compared to prepandemic levels into fiscal 2022 longerterm because the duration of the pandemic is unclear it is difficult to forecast a precise impact on the company’s future results 

the company took immediate and aggressive action to minimize the spread of covid19 in our workplaces and reduce costs since the early days of the pandemic we have been following guidance from the world health organization and the us center for disease control to protect employees and prevent the spread of the virus within all of our facilities globally 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2021 covid19 restructuring costs incurred were approximately 36 million of which 26 million was recorded in cost of sales and 10 million was recorded in selling and administrative expenses these were costs related to the companys actions to reduce its workforce to align with customer demand additionally the company incurred approximately 4 million in incremental costs related to the pandemic that are not expected to recur once the pandemic has subsided and are clearly separable from normal operations eg additional cleaning and disinfecting of facilities by contractors above and beyond normal requirements personal protective equipment 

as of september 30 2021 the restructuring accrual associated with the costs incurred in response to the covid19 pandemic was approximately 19 million in fiscal 2022 the company may incur additional restructuring and incremental costs related to the covid19 pandemic though at a reduced level in comparison to fiscal 2021 and 2020 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain operating data of the company including presentation of the amounts as a percentage of net sales amounts in millions

1 includes debt issuance costs and original issue discount and premiums reference note 12 “debt” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information 

2 for purposes of computing the ratio of earnings to fixed charges earnings consist of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes plus fixed charges fixed charges consist of interest expense amortization of debt issuance costs original issue discount and premium and the “interest component” of rental expense 

we have historically maintained a capital structure comprising a mix of equity and debt financing we vary our leverage both to optimize our equity return and to pursue acquisitions we expect to meet our current debt obligations as they come due through internally generated funds from current levels of operations andor through refinancing in the debt markets prior to the maturity dates of our debt 

if the company has excess cash it generally prioritizes allocating the excess cash in the following manner 1 capital spending at existing businesses 2 acquisitions of businesses 3 payment of a special dividend andor repurchases of our common stock and 4 prepayment of indebtedness or repurchase of debt whether the company undertakes common stock repurchases or other aforementioned activities will depend on prevailing market conditions the companys liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material in addition the company may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so 

the company’s ability to make scheduled interest payments on or to refinance the company’s indebtedness or to fund nonacquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on the company’s ability to generate cash in the future this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control including the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

the company is continuing to strategically manage the company’s cash and cash equivalents in response to the ongoing covid19 pandemic and related uncertainty of the duration and impact of the pandemic on the company’s business in fiscal 2022 and beyond for instance due to favorable market conditions in the high yield bond market the company refinanced 1950 of its senior subordinated notes in fiscal 2021 resulting in a reduced interest rate estimated 35 million reduction in annual interest payments and an extended maturity date 

as of september 30 2021 the company has significant cash liquidity as illustrated in the table presented below in millions 



 

1 on october 6 2021 the company repaid 200 million drawn on the revolving credit facility using existing cash on hand increasing the borrowings available under the revolving credit facility to 7289 million 

we believe our significant cash liquidity will allow us to meet our anticipated funding requirements we expect to meet our shortterm cash liquidity requirements including interest obligations and capital expenditures through net cash from operating activities cash on hand and if needed additional draws on the revolving credit facility longterm cash liquidity requirements consist primarily of obligations under our longterm debt agreements there is no maturity on any tranche of term loans or notes until august 2024 

in connection with the continued application of our three core valuedriven operating strategies obtaining profitable new business continually improving our cost structure and providing highly engineered valueadded products to customers we expect our efforts will continue to generate strong margins and provide sufficient cash provided by operating activities to meet our interest obligations and liquidity needs we believe our cash provided by operating activities and available borrowing capacity will enable us to make strategic business acquisitions such as the cac acquisition completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 for an enterprise value of 965 million using existing cash on hand pay dividends to our shareholders and make opportunistic investments in our own stock subject to any restrictions in our existing credit agreement and market conditions in consideration of the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

in the future the company may increase its borrowings in connection with acquisitions if cash flow from operating activities becomes insufficient to fund current operations or for other shortterm cash needs or for stock repurchases or dividends our future leverage will also be impacted by the then current conditions of the credit markets 

operating activities  the company generated 913 million of net cash from operating activities during fiscal 2021 compared to 1213 million during fiscal 2020 the change from prior year is primarily driven by changes in working capital as further described below 

the change in trade accounts receivable during fiscal 2021 was a use of cash of 78 million in cash compared to a source of cash of 352 million in fiscal 2020 the increase in the use of cash of 430 million is primarily attributable to the decrease in accounts receivable from lower sales due to the covid19 pandemic the company continues to actively manage its accounts receivable the related agings and collection efforts in response to the covid19 pandemic 

the change in inventories during fiscal 2021 was a source of cash of 79 million compared to a use of cash of 62 million in fiscal 2020 the increase in the source of cash is primarily driven by decreased purchasing of raw materials particularly in the first half of fiscal 2021 from lower demand as a result of the covid19 pandemic and actively managing inventory levels 

the change in accounts payable during fiscal 2021 was a source of cash of 3 million compared to a use of cash of 62 million in fiscal 2020 primarily due to timing of payments to suppliers 

investing activities net cash used in investing activities was 785 million during fiscal 2021 consisting primarily of 945 million from the acquisition of cac in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and capital expenditures of 105 million this was partially offset by proceeds of 259 million from the completion of the divestitures of certain businesses and 24 million of insurance proceeds received from the leach international europe facility fire claim the company estimates its capital expenditures in fiscal year 2022 to be between 135 million and 155 million with the increase from prior year attributable to projects that were delayed into fiscal 2022 as a result of the covid19 pandemic the company’s capital expenditures incurred from yeartoyear are primarily for projects that are consistent with our three core valuedriven operating strategies obtaining profitable new business continually improving our cost structure and providing highly engineered valueadded products to customers 

financing activities  net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2021 was 70 million the use of cash was primarily attributable to the redemptions of the 2024 notes and 2025 notes for 1220 million and 762 million respectively repayment on term loans of 75 million and dividend equivalent payments of 73 million this was partially offset by 1189 million in net proceeds from the completion of the 4625 2029 notes offering 743 million in net proceeds from the completion of the 4875 2029 notes offering and 128 million in proceeds from stock option exercises

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with us gaap which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations however investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 

below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions for additional significant accounting policies see note 3 “summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

revenue recognition – revenue is recognized from the sale of products when control transfers to the customer which is demonstrated by our right to payment a transfer of title a transfer of the risk and rewards of ownership or the customer acceptance but most frequently upon shipment where the customer obtains physical possession of the goods the majority of the companys revenue is recorded at a point in time sales recognized over time are generally accounted for using an input measure to determine progress completed at the end of the period sales for service contracts generally are recognized as the services are provided for agreements with multiple performance obligations judgment is required to determine whether performance obligations specified in these agreements are distinct and should be accounted for as separate revenue transactions for recognition purposes based on the standalone selling price of each performance obligation the primary method used to estimate a standalone selling price is the price observed in standalone sales to customers for the same product or service we consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assesses variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price variable consideration is included in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount including whether the estimate should be constrained in order to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in a future period these estimates are based on historical experience anticipated performance under the terms of the contract and our best judgment at the time 

inventories – inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost of inventories is generally determined by the average cost and the firstin firstout “fifo” methods and includes material labor and overhead related to the manufacturing process because the company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be inservice for 25 or more years it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use where management estimated that the net realizable value was below cost or determined that future demand was lower than current inventory levels based on historical experience current and projected market demand current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value was made by recording a provision included in cost of sales additionally management believes that the company’s estimates of excess and obsolete inventory are reasonable and material changes in future estimates or assumptions used to calculate our estimate is unlikely however actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future a 10 change in our excess and obsolete inventory reserve at september 30 2021 would not have a material impact on our results in accordance with industry practice all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year 

goodwill and other intangible assets – in accordance with asc 805 “business combinations” the company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized as goodwill the valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows revenue growth rates and ebitda margins discount rates customer attrition rates royalty rates asset lives and market multiples among other items we determine the fair values of intangible assets acquired generally in consultation with thirdparty valuation advisors fair value adjustments to the company’s assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition  

intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights or if the intangible asset can be sold transferred licensed or exchanged regardless of the company’s intent to do so goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition and are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates 

us gaap requires that the annual and any interim goodwill impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level the reporting unit level is one level below an operating segment substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each reporting unit pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction with respect to acquisitions integrated into an existing reporting unit any acquired goodwill is combined with the goodwill of the reporting unit 

at the time of goodwill impairment testing the company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test the quantitative test is required only if the company concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount or if the company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit for the quantitative test management determines the estimated fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit if the calculated estimated fair value is less than the current carrying value impairment of goodwill of the reporting unit may exist the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing includes discount rates revenue growth rates and ebitda margins cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates are set by using the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” methodology the wacc methodology considers market and industry data as well as company specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business 

management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit terminal value rate determination follows a common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates 

management tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at the asset level as determined by appropriate asset valuation at the time of acquisition the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets consists of a comparison between the estimated fair values and carrying values if the carrying amounts of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives exceed their estimated fair values an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference management utilizes the royalty savings valuation method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset in this method management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset the key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates royalty rates growth rates sales projections and terminal value rates discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the wacc methodology considering any differences in companyspecific risk factors between reporting units and the indefinitelived intangible assets royalty rates are established by management with the advice of valuation experts management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant intangible asset terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates 

the discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed actual results could differ from these assumptions management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering the current economic conditions 

given the continued adverse global economic and market conditions attributable to the covid19 pandemic particularly as it pertains to the commercial aerospace sector the company continues to monitor for any indicators of impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for certain reporting units that have higher commercial aerospace content and potentially present a higher risk for impairment the company performed a quantitative impairment test using an income approach in the prior year annual impairment assessment in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 the company reviewed the key assumptions used within the models to identify if any changes were necessary key assumptions reviewed included revenue growth rates and ebitda margins available industry data and management’s determination of the prospective financial information with consideration of the estimated length of time for the commercial aerospace sector to rebound to prepandemic levels the company also utilized a third party valuation firm to assist in the determination of the wacc as a result of the interim impairment testing performed as of april 3 2021 no goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets were determined to be impaired we updated our assessment during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and validated that the assumptions used in the analyses performed as of april 3 2021 and the resulting conclusions remain appropriate as of july 3 2021 

the company had 46 reporting units with goodwill and 43 reporting units with indefinitelived intangible assets as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 the date of the annual impairment test based on its initial qualitative assessment over each of the reporting units the company identified 16 reporting units to test for impairment using a quantitative test for both goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets the estimated fair value of each of these reporting units was in excess of its respective carrying value and therefore no impairment was recorded on goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate which is a significant assumption in the calculation of fair values with a one percentage point increase in the discount rate all of the reporting units would continue to have fair values in excess of their respective carrying values 

stockbased compensation – the cost of the company’s stockbased compensation is recorded in accordance with asc 718 “stock compensation” the company uses a blackscholes pricing model to estimate the grantdate fair value of the stock options awarded the blackscholes pricing model requires assumptions regarding the expected volatility of the company’s common shares the riskfree interest rate the expected life of the stock options award and the company’s dividend yield the company utilizes historical data in determining the assumptions an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside of management’s control could have an impact on the blackscholes pricing model the company estimates stock option forfeitures based on historical data the total number of stock options expected to vest is adjusted by actual and estimated forfeitures changes to the actual and estimated forfeitures will result in a cumulative adjustment in the period of change the company also evaluates any subsequent changes to the respective option holders terms under the modification rules of asc 718 if determined to be a modification the blackscholes pricing model is updated as of the date of the modification resulting in a cumulative catchup to expense 

income taxes – the company estimates income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates this involves estimating taxable earnings specific taxable and deductible items the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits to the extent these estimates change adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes are made in the period in which the changes occur historically such adjustments have not been significant

nongaap financial measures 

we present below certain financial information based on our ebitda and ebitda as defined references to “ebitda” mean earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and references to “ebitda as defined” mean ebitda plus as applicable for each relevant period certain adjustments as set forth in the reconciliations of income from continuing operations to ebitda and ebitda as defined and the reconciliations of net cash provided by operating activities to ebitda and ebitda as defined presented below 

neither ebitda nor ebitda as defined is a measurement of financial performance under us gaap we present ebitda and ebitda as defined because we believe they are useful indicators for evaluating operating performance and liquidity 

our management believes that ebitda and ebitda as defined are useful as indicators of liquidity because securities analysts investors rating agencies and others use ebitda to evaluate a company’s ability to incur and service debt in addition ebitda as defined is useful to investors because the revolving credit facility under our senior secured credit facility requires compliance under certain circumstances on a pro forma basis with a financial covenant that measures the ratio of the amount of our secured indebtedness to the amount of our consolidated ebitda defined in the same manner as we define ebitda as defined herein 

in addition to the above our management uses ebitda as defined to review and assess the performance of the management team in connection with employee incentive programs and to prepare its annual budget and financial projections moreover our management uses ebitda as defined to evaluate acquisitions 

although we use ebitda and ebitda as defined as measures to assess the performance of our business and for the other purposes set forth above the use of these nongaap financial measures as analytical tools has limitations and you should not consider any of them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported in accordance with us gaap some of these limitations are 

• neither ebitda nor ebitda as defined reflects the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments on our indebtedness 

• although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and neither ebitda nor ebitda as defined reflects any cash requirements for such replacements 

• the omission of the substantial amortization expense associated with our intangible assets further limits the usefulness of ebitda and ebitda as defined 

• neither ebitda nor ebitda as defined includes the payment of taxes which is a necessary element of our operations and 

• ebitda as defined excludes the cash expense we have incurred to integrate acquired businesses into our operations which is a necessary element of certain of our acquisitions 

because of these limitations ebitda and ebitda as defined should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business management compensates for these limitations by not viewing ebitda or ebitda as defined in isolation and specifically by using other us gaap measures such as net income net sales and operating profit to measure our operating performance neither ebitda nor ebitda as defined is a measurement of financial performance under us gaap and neither should be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations determined in accordance with us gaap our calculation of ebitda and ebitda as defined may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  interest rate risk 

our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk is principally our variable rate debt in 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate libor and other interbank offered rates which have been widely used as reference rates for various securities and financial contracts including loans debt and derivatives however for us dollar libor the relevant date has been deferred to at least june 30 2023 for certain tenors at which time the libor administrator has indicated that it intends to cease publication of us dollar libor despite this deferral the libor administrator has advised that no new contracts using us dollar libor should be entered into after december 31 2021 these actions indicate that the continuation of us libor on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after june 30 2023 moreover it is possible that us libor will be discontinued or modified prior to june 30 2023 in february 2020 in connection with amendment no 7 to the credit agreement we amended our credit agreement to include a provision for the determination of an alternative reference interest rate the discontinuation of libor will also require our derivative agreements to be amended once the alternative interest rate has replaced libor our future interest expense could be impacted 

at september 30 2021 we had borrowings under our term loans of approximately 7374 million that were subject to interest rate risk borrowings under our term loans bear interest at our option at a rate equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted libor for a one two three or sixmonth or to the extent available to each lender nine or twelvemonth interest period chosen by us in each case plus an applicable margin percentage accordingly the company’s cash flows and earnings will be exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes resulting from variable rate borrowings under our term loans the companys objective is to maintain an allocation of at least 75 fixed rate and 25 variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in nearterm interest rates as of september 30 2021 approximately 86 of our total debt was fixed rate debt the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the annual interest costs under our term loans by approximately 75 million based on the amount of outstanding borrowings at september 30 2021 the weighted average interest rate on the 7374 million of borrowings under our term loans on september 30 2021 was 34 

interest rate swaps and caps used to hedge and offset respectively the variable interest rates on the credit facility are described in note 21 “derivatives and hedging activities” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes 

for information about the fair value of the aggregate principal amount of borrowings under our term loans and the fair value of the notes refer to note 20 “fair value measurements” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

  foreign currency risk 

certain of our foreign subsidiaries’ sales and results of operations are subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which we transact business could materially adversely affect our net sales net income and the carrying values of our assets located outside the us global economic uncertainty continues to exist strengthening of the us dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our operating results foreign currency forward exchange contracts provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies at specified future dates at specified exchange rates and are used to offset changes in the fair value of certain assets or liabilities or forecasted cash flows resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies the foreign currency forward exchange contracts entered into by the company are described in note 21 “derivatives and hedging activities” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

if the us dollar were to strengthen our foreign results of operations would be unfavorably impacted but the effect is not expected to be material a 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have resulted in a material impact to net income for the fiscal year ended september 30 2021

 item 1 business 

the company 

td group through its whollyowned subsidiary transdigm inc is a leading global designer producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers we estimate that approximately 90 of our net sales for fiscal year 2020 were generated by proprietary products for fiscal year 2020 we estimate that we generated approximately 80 of our net sales from products in which we are the sole source provider 

most of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue once our parts are designed into and sold on a new aircraft we generate net sales from aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft which is generally estimated to be approximately 25 to 30 years a typical platform can be produced for 20 to 30 years giving us an estimated product life cycle in excess of 50 years we estimate that approximately 49 of our net sales in fiscal year 2020 were generated from aftermarket sales the vast majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets historically these aftermarket revenues have produced a higher gross margin and been more stable than sales to original equipment manufacturers “oems” 

products 

we primarily design produce and supply highly engineered proprietary aerospace components with significant aftermarket content we seek to develop highly customized products to solve specific needs for aircraft operators and manufacturers we attempt to differentiate ourselves based on engineering service and manufacturing capabilities we typically choose not to compete for nonproprietary “build to print” business because it frequently offers lower margins than proprietary products we believe that our products have strong brand names within the industry and that we have a reputation for high quality reliability and strong customer support 

our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products that we offer to our customers our major product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and engine technology specialized pumps and valves power conditioning devices specialized acdc electric motors and generators batteries and chargers engineered latching and locking devices engineered rods engineered connectors and elastomer sealing solutions databus and power controls cockpit security components and systems specialized and advanced cockpit displays aircraft audio systems specialized lavatory components seat belts and safety restraints engineered and customized interior surfaces and related components advanced sensor products switches and relay panels thermal protection and insulation lighting and control technology parachutes high performance hoists winches and lifting devices and cargo loading handling and delivery systems 

covid19 pandemic 

in december 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 surfaced in wuhan china and has since spread to other countries including the united states in march 2020 the world health organization characterized covid19 as a pandemic the pandemic has resulted in governments around the world implementing stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus including quarantines “shelter in place” and “stay at home” orders travel restrictions business curtailments and other measures as a result demand for travel declined at a rapid pace and has remained depressed the exact timing and pace of the recovery is indeterminable as certain markets have reopened some of which have since experienced a resurgence of covid19 cases while others particularly international markets remain closed or are enforcing extended quarantines governments and central banks in several parts of the world have enacted fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to counteract the impact of covid19 the commercial aerospace industry in particular has been significantly disrupted both domestically and internationally the impact of covid19 is fluid and continues to evolve and the shape and speed of recovery for the commercial aerospace industry remains uncertain 

we took immediate and aggressive action to minimize the spread of covid19 in our workplaces and reduce costs since the early days of the pandemic we have been following guidance from the world health organization and the us center for disease control to protect employees and prevent the spread of the virus within all of our facilities globally some of the actions implemented include flexible workfromhome scheduling alternate shift schedules preshift temperature screenings where allowed by law social distancing appropriate personal protective equipment facility deep cleaning and paid quarantine time for impacted employees material actions to reduce costs included 1 reducing our workforce to align operations with customer demand 2 implementing unpaid furloughs and salary reductions and 3 delaying nonessential capital projects and minimizing discretionary spending at the same time we addressed the ongoing needs of our business to continue to serve our customers as a result of the covid19 pandemic many of our businesses have taken the opportunity to explore new business opportunities by working on developing highly engineered solutions for emerging needs arising from the pandemic product solutions currently being explored include antiviral or antimicrobial technology air purification and touchless technologies among others 

segments 

the company’s businesses are organized and managed in three reporting segments power  control airframe and nonaviation 

the power  control segment includes operations that primarily develop produce and market systems and components that predominately provide power to or control power of the aircraft utilizing electronic fluid power and mechanical motion control technologies major product offerings include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and engine technology specialized pumps and valves power conditioning devices specialized acdc electric motors and generators batteries and chargers databus and power controls advanced sensor products switches and relay panels high performance hoists winches and lifting devices and cargo loading handling and delivery systems primary customers of this segment are engine and power system and subsystem suppliers airlines third party maintenance suppliers military buying agencies and repair depots products are sold in the original equipment and aftermarket market channels 

the airframe segment includes operations that primarily develop produce and market systems and components that are used in nonpower airframe applications utilizing airframe and cabin structure technologies major product offerings include engineered latching and locking devices engineered rods engineered connectors and elastomer sealing solutions cockpit security components and systems specialized and advanced cockpit displays aircraft audio systems specialized lavatory components seat belts and safety restraints engineered and customized interior surfaces and related components thermal protection and insulation lighting and control technology and parachutes primary customers of this segment are airframe manufacturers and cabin system suppliers and subsystem suppliers airlines third party maintenance suppliers military buying agencies and repair depots products are sold in the original equipment and aftermarket market channels 

the nonaviation segment includes operations that primarily develop produce and market products for nonaviation markets major product offerings include headsets for highnoise mediumnoise and dismounted applications seat belts and safety restraints for ground transportation applications mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls for space applications hydraulicelectromechanical actuators and fuel valves for land based gas turbines and refueling systems for heavy equipment used in mining construction and other industries and turbine controls for the energy and oil and gas markets primary customers of this segment are offroad vehicle suppliers and subsystem suppliers child restraint system suppliers satellite and space system suppliers manufacturers of heavy equipment used in mining construction and other industries and turbine original equipment manufacturers gas pipeline builders and electric utilities 

the primary measurement used by management to review and assess the operating performance of each segment is ebitda as defined the company defines ebitda as defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization plus certain nonoperating items recorded as corporate expenses including refinancing costs acquisitionrelated costs transactionrelated costs foreign currency gains and losses and noncash compensation charges incurred in connection with the company’s stock incentive plans acquisitionrelated costs represent accounting adjustments to inventory associated with acquisitions of businesses and product lines that were charged to cost of sales when the inventory was sold costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses and product lines into the company’s operations facility relocation costs and other acquisitionrelated costs transactionrelated costs comprising deal fees legal financial and tax diligence expenses and valuation costs that are required to be expensed as incurred and other acquisition accounting adjustments 

for financial information about our segments see note 17 “segments” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

sales and marketing 

consistent with our overall strategy our sales and marketing organization is structured to continually develop technical solutions that meet customer needs in particular we attempt to focus on products and programs that will lead to highmargin repeatable sales in the aftermarket 

we have structured our sales efforts along our major product offerings assigning a business unit manager to certain products each business unit manager is expected to grow the sales and profitability of the products for which he or she is responsible and to achieve the targeted annual level of bookings sales new business and profitability for such products the business unit managers are assisted by account managers and sales engineers who are responsible for covering major oem and aftermarket accounts account managers and sales engineers are expected to be familiar with the personnel organization and needs of specific customers to achieve total bookings and new business goals for each account and together with the business unit managers to determine when additional resources are required at customer locations most of our sales personnel are evaluated in part on their bookings and their ability to identify and obtain new business opportunities 

though typically performed by employees the account manager function may be performed by independent representatives depending on the specific customer product and geographic location we also use a number of distributors to provide logistical support as well as serve as a primary customer contact with certain smaller accounts our major distributors are boeing distribution inc formerly known as aviall inc and satair as a subsidiary of airbus sas 

manufacturing and engineering 

we maintain approximately 105 manufacturing facilities most of our manufacturing facilities are comprised of manufacturing distribution and engineering functions and most facilities have certain administrative functions including management sales and finance we continually strive to improve productivity and reduce costs including rationalization of operations developing improved control systems that allow for accurate accounting and reporting investing in equipment tooling information systems and implementing broadbased employee training programs management believes that our manufacturing systems and equipment contribute to our ability to compete by permitting us to meet the rigorous tolerances and cost sensitive price structure of aircraft component customers 

we attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by producing uniquely engineered products with high quality and timely delivery our engineering costs are recorded in cost of sales and in selling and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income research and development costs are recorded in selling and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income the aggregate of engineering expense and research and development expense represents approximately 11 of our operating units’ aggregate costs or approximately 6 of our consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2020 our proprietary products and particularly our new product initiatives are designed by our engineers and are intended to serve the needs of the aircraft component industry these proprietary designs must withstand the extraordinary conditions and stresses that will be endured by products during use and meet the rigorous demands of our customers’ tolerance and quality requirements 

we use sophisticated equipment and procedures to comply with quality requirements specifications and federal aviation administration “faa” and oem requirements we perform a variety of testing procedures as required by our customers such as testing under different temperature humidity and altitude levels flammability testing shock and vibration testing and xray fluorescent measurement these procedures together with other customer approved techniques for document process and quality control are used throughout our manufacturing facilities refer to note 3 “summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein with respect to total costs of research and development 

customers 

we predominantly serve customers in the commercial regional business jet and general aviation aftermarket which accounted for approximately 26 of net sales for fiscal year 2020 the commercial aerospace oem market comprising large commercial transport manufacturers and regional and business jet manufacturers which accounted for approximately 26 of net sales for fiscal year 2020 and the defense market which accounted for approximately 43 of net sales for fiscal year 2020 nonaerospace sales comprised approximately 5 of our net sales for fiscal year 2020 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic and its adverse impact on air travel worldwide the commercial aerospace industry has been significantly disrupted the defense aerospace market has been impacted by the covid19 pandemic to a lesser extent than the commercial aerospace market due to certain supply chain disruptions as well as “stay at home” orders quarantines etc impacting the government procurement workforce which has slowed production andor orders the significant adverse impact of the covid19 pandemic on the commercial aerospace market channels has led to the defense market comprising a greater percentage of our net sales in fiscal 2020 than typical in our prior five fiscal years fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2019 defense market sales ranged from 29 to 37 of net sales when the commercial aerospace industry recovers from the disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic we would expect defense market sales to account for a percentage of net sales that is relatively in line with our historical results prior to the covid19 pandemic 

our customers include 1 distributors of aerospace components 2 worldwide commercial airlines including national and regional airlines 3 large commercial transport and regional and business aircraft oems 4 various armed forces of the united states and friendly foreign governments 5 defense oems 6 system suppliers and 7 various other industrial customers our top ten customers for fiscal year 2020 accounted for approximately 44 of our net sales products supplied to many of our customers are used on multiple platforms none of our customers individually accounted for greater than 10 of our sales for fiscal year 2020 

the markets in which we sell our products are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced upswings and downturns the demand for our commercial aftermarket parts and services depends on among other things the breadth of our installed oem base revenue passenger miles “rpms” the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet the percentage of the worldwide fleet that is in warranty and airline profitability the demand for defense products is specifically dependent on government budget trends military campaigns and political pressures 

competition 

the niche markets within the aerospace industry that we serve are relatively fragmented and we face several competitors for many of the products and services we provide due to the global nature of the commercial aircraft industry competition in these categories comes from both us and foreign companies competitors in our product offerings range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privatelyheld entities with only one or two components in their entire product portfolios 

we compete on the basis of engineering manufacturing and marketing high quality products which we believe meet or exceed the performance and maintenance requirements of our customers consistent and timely delivery and superior customer service and support the industry’s stringent regulatory certification and technical requirements and the investments necessary in the development and certification of products may create disincentives for potential new competitors for certain products if customers receive products that meet or exceed expectations and performance standards we believe that they will have a reduced incentive to certify another supplier because of the cost and time of the technical design and testing certification process in addition we believe that the availability dependability and safety of our products are reasons for our customers to continue longterm supplier relationships 

government contracts 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to united states government “us government” agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 1 suspend us from receiving new contracts 2 terminate existing contracts 3 reduce the value of existing contracts 4 audit our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs 5 control and potentially prohibit the export of our products and 6 seek repayment of contract related payments under certain circumstances violations of government procurement laws could result in civil or criminal penalties 

governmental regulation 

the commercial aircraft component industry is highly regulated by the faa in the united states and by the joint aviation authorities in europe and other agencies throughout the world while the military aircraft component industry is governed by military quality specifications we and the components we manufacture are required to be certified by one or more of these entities or agencies and in many cases by individual oems in order to engineer and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models 

we must also satisfy the requirements of our customers including oems and airlines that are subject to faa regulations and provide these customers with products and services that comply with the government regulations applicable to commercial flight operations in addition the faa requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components we believe that we currently satisfy or exceed these maintenance standards in our repair and overhaul services we also maintain several faaapproved repair stations 

in addition our businesses are subject to many other laws and requirements typically applicable to manufacturers and exporters without limiting the foregoing sales of many of our products that will be used on aircraft owned by foreign entities are subject to compliance with export control laws and the manufacture of our products and the operations of our businesses including the disposal of hazardous wastes are subject to compliance with applicable environmental laws 

market channels 

the commercial aerospace industry including the aftermarket and oem markets is impacted by the health of the global economy and geopolitical events around the world the covid19 pandemic has resulted in governments around the world implementing stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus including quarantines “shelterinplace” and “stay at home” orders travel restrictions business curtailments and other measures as a result demand for travel declined at a rapid pace and remains depressed the exact timing and pace of the recovery is indeterminable as certain markets have reopened some of which have experienced a resurgence of covid19 cases while others particularly international markets remain closed or are enforcing extended quarantines the commercial aerospace industry in particular has been significantly disrupted by the pandemic both domestically and internationally the commercial aerospace industry has experienced a steep decline in rpms in 2020 due to the pandemic’s impact on worldwide air travel demand also as a result of the pandemic and decreased demand in commercial air travel the commercial oem sector has experienced reductions in commercial oem production rates including reductions at the two largest commercial oems the boeing company and airbus sas in addition to various airlines deferring or cancelling orders t he impact of covid19 is fluid and continues to evolve and the shape and speed of the recovery for the commercial aerospace industry remains uncertain  

the defense aerospace market is dependent on government budget constraints the timing of orders political pressures and the extent of global conflicts it is not necessarily affected by general economic conditions that affect the commercial aerospace industry the defense aerospace market has been impacted by the covid19 pandemic to a lesser extent than the commercial aerospace market due to certain supply chain disruptions as well as “stay at home” orders quarantines etc impacting the government procurement workforce which has slowed production andor orders 

historically our presence in both the commercial aerospace and military sectors of the aerospace industry has served to mitigate the impact on our business of any specific industry risk we service a diversified customer base in the commercial and military aerospace industry and we provide components to a diverse installed base of aircraft which mitigates our exposure to any individual airframe platform at times declines in sales in one channel have been offset by increased sales in another channel however due to differences between the profitability of our products sold to oem and aftermarket customers variation in product mix can cause variation in gross margin 

outside of the significant market disruption caused by covid19 there are many shortterm factors including customer inventory level adjustments unannounced changes in order patterns strikes facility shutdowns caused by fires hurricanes health crises or other incidents and mergers and acquisitions that can cause shortterm disruptions in our quarterly shipment patterns as compared to previous quarters and the same periods in prior years as such it can be difficult to determine longerterm trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons to normalize for shortterm fluctuations we tend to look at our performance over several quarters or years of activity rather than discrete shortterm periods there are also fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering and delivery requests from quartertoquarter as well as variations in product mix from quartertoquarter that may cause positive or negative variations in gross profit margins since commercial aftermarket sales have historically produced a higher gross margin than sales to commercial oems again in many instances these are timing events between quarters and must be balanced with macro aerospace industry indicators 

the magnitude of the impact of covid19 on our market channels particularly commercial oem and commercial aftermarket remains unpredictable and we therefore continue to anticipate potential supply chain disruptions employee absenteeism and shortterm suspensions of manufacturing facilities and additional health and safety costs related to the covid19 pandemic that could unfavorably impact our business longer term because the duration of the pandemic is unclear it is difficult to forecast a precise impact on our future results 

commercial aftermarket 

the key market factors in the commercial aftermarket include worldwide rpms and the size and activity level of the worldwide fleet of aircraft and the percentage of the fleet that is in warranty as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the stringent measures implemented to help control the spread of the virus demand for air travel declined at a rapid pace and has remained depressed the reduced demand has led to a significant reduction in flights and an increase in parked aircraft certain airlines have also retired a portion of their fleets certain markets have reopened some of which have experienced a resurgence of covid19 cases while others particularly international markets remain closed or are enforcing extended quarantines current industry consensus indicates that rpms will continue to recover in 2021 however the timing and pace of the commercial aftermarket recovery remains uncertain and may not return to prepandemic levels until 2023 or beyond 

commercial oem market 

the commercial oem market declined in 2020 primarily due to the covid19 pandemic our commercial transport oem shipments and revenues generally run ahead of the boeing company and airbus sas airframe delivery schedules as a result and consistent with prior years our fiscal 2021 shipments will be a function of among other things the estimated 2021 and 2022 commercial airframe production rates we have been experiencing decreased sales across the commercial oem sector driven primarily by the decrease in production by the boeing company and airbus sas related to reduced demand in the commercial aerospace industry from the covid19 pandemic and also in boeing’s case the 737 max’s grounding and subsequent production slowdown and airlines deferring or cancelling orders current industry consensus indicates production rates will continue to be lower than prepandemic historic levels but will gradually increase over the next several years however the duration of the pandemic is unclear and the recovery of the commercial oem market remains uncertain and continues to evolve 

our businesses continually seek to provide solutions for our customers and others in the commercial aerospace industry for example as a result of the covid19 pandemic many of our businesses have taken the opportunity to explore new business opportunities by working on developing highly engineered solutions for emerging needs arising from the pandemic product solutions currently being explored include antiviral or antimicrobial technology air purification and touchless technologies among others 

defense 

our military business fluctuates from year to year and is dependent to a degree on government budget constraints the timing of orders macro and micro dynamics with respect to the us department of defense “dod” procurement policy and the extent of global conflicts the defense aerospace market is impacted by the covid19 pandemic to a lesser extent than the commercial aerospace market due to certain supply chain disruptions as well as “stay at home” orders quarantines etc impacting the government procurement workforce which has slowed production andor orders also government funding reprioritization such as shifting funds to efforts to combat the impact of the pandemic provides for uncertainty for a variety of reasons the military spending outlook is very uncertain for planning purposes we assume that militaryrelated sales of our types of products to be flat in future years over the recent high levels 

in fiscal 2020 the defense market channel comprises a greater percentage of our net sales than historical comparisons due to the significant adverse impact of the covid19 pandemic on our commercial aftermarket channel and commercial oem market channel in our prior five fiscal years fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2019 defense market sales ranged from 29 to 37 of net sales when the commercial aerospace industry recovers from the disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic we would expect defense market sales to account for a percentage of net sales that is relatively in line with our historical results prior to the covid19 pandemic 

raw materials 

we require the use of various raw materials in our manufacturing processes we also purchase a variety of manufactured component parts from various suppliers we also purchase replacement parts which are utilized in our various repair and overhaul operations at times we concentrate our orders among a few suppliers in order to strengthen our supplier relationships most of our raw materials and component parts are generally available from multiple suppliers at competitive prices due to the covid19 pandemic certain disruptions in the global supply chain occurred while none of these disruptions had a significant negative impact to our manufacturing processes there were some minor shipment delays 

intellectual property 

we have various trade secrets proprietary information trademarks trade names patents copyrights and other intellectual property rights which we believe in the aggregate but not individually are important to our business 

backlog 

as of september 30 2020 the company estimated its sales order backlog at 3145 million compared to an estimated sales order backlog of 3437 million as of september 30 2019 the decrease in backlog is attributable to the adverse impact that the covid19 pandemic has had on customer demand particularly our commercial customers domestically and internationally the uncertainty of the duration of the pandemic and its impact on the commercial aerospace industry is expected to continue to inhibit sales order backlog growth in the commercial oem and commercial aftermarket channels into fiscal 2021 partially offsetting the decrease in commercial oem and aftermarket sales backlog is an increase in total defense sales backlog 

the majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of september 30 2020 are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months purchase orders may be subject to cancellation or deferral by the customer prior to shipment the level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of the company’s receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled accordingly the company’s backlog as of september 30 2020 may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period 

environmental matters 

our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things discharges of pollutants into the air and water the generation handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees environmental laws and regulations may require that the company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations certain facilities and thirdparty sites utilized by the company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws the company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws for information regarding environmental accruals refer to note 15 “commitments and contingencies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

employees 

as of september 30 2020 we had approximately 14200 fulltime parttime and temporary employees approximately 17 of our fulltime and parttime employees were represented by labor unions collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire at various dates ranging from november 2020 to november 2024 we consider our relationship with our employees generally to be satisfactory 

the development attraction and retention of employees is a critical success factor for transdigm and its operating units for succession planning and sustaining our three core value drivers to support the advancement of our employees we offer training and development programs encouraging advancement from within and continue to fill our team with strong and experienced management talent we leverage both formal and informal programs to identify foster and retain top talent at both the corporate and operating unit level 

we have established transdigm university a formal mentoring and education program with a formal curriculum and established leadership serving as mentors participants in the program learn and develop more advanced skills leading to higher contribution and satisfaction within their roles while mentors enhance their leadership capabilities by helping others progress this program helps in identifying top performers improving employee performance and retention increasing our organizational learning and supporting the promotion of our current employees 

the company’s management development program “mdp” identifies new talent and prepares them for success within our organization the program hires recent master of business administration “mba” graduates who will work for three eightmonth stints at a selection of operating units program participants gain experience in developing manufacturing and selling aerospace components with the intent of becoming fully immersed in the operations of our business once the program is complete mdp participants will be better equipped with the knowledge and experience needed to excel as a manager at the company our goal for successful mdp participants is to hire them on a fulltime basis at an operating unit upon completion of the program 

transdigm’s executive team also mentors rising talent on a more informal basis this informal mentorship achieves a number of goals including accelerating the development of top performers increasing organizational learning and improving employee performance and retention the executive team also commits substantial time to evaluating the bench strength of our leadership and working with our leadership to improve their performance 

transdigm university mdp various internship programs and informal mentoring demonstrates the company’s ongoing commitment and initiatives towards accelerating our future leaders 

the company’s equity compensation plans are designed to assist in attracting retaining motivating and rewarding key employees directors or consultants and promoting the creation of longterm value for stockholders by closely aligning the interests of these individuals with those of the company’s stockholders the company’s equity compensation plans provide for the granting of performance based stock options 

the plans are important because equity compensation and specifically stock options is a significant component of the company’s private equitybased compensation strategy and valuebased culture and the continued use of performancebased stock options will help retain the company’s key employees and recruit new employees the company has a history of providing and intends to continue to provide cash compensation to its top employees that is below the market median and cause the largest portion of their potential earnings to come from growth in the company’s equity value additionally the plans give the company more flexibility in granting awards to new employees joining the company as a result of future acquisitions which are an essential part of the company’s growth the equity compensation plan is a good motivational incentive which also contributes to very de minimis voluntary turnover of participants in the plan

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below are material risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business and financial condition and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements contained in this report additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition 

risks related to our strategy 

we rely heavily on certain customers for much of our sales 

in fiscal year 2020 no customer individually accounted for 10 or more of the company’s net sales however our top ten customers for fiscal year 2020 accounted for approximately 44 of our net sales in fiscal year 2019 one customer individually accounted for approximately 11 of the company’s net sales in fiscal year 2018 two customers individually accounted for approximately 11 and 10 of the company’s net sales a material reduction in purchasing by one of our larger customers for any reason including but not limited to economic downturn decreased production strike or resourcing could have a material adverse effect on results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we generally do not have guaranteed future sales of our products further when we enter into fixed price contracts with some of our customers we take the risk for cost overruns 

as is customary in our business we do not generally have longterm contracts with most of our aftermarket customers and therefore do not have guaranteed future sales although we have longterm contracts with many of our oem customers many of those customers may terminate the contracts on short notice and in most cases our customers have not committed to buy any minimum quantity of our products in addition in certain cases we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon the historic purchasing patterns of customers and upon our discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements and this anticipated future volume of orders may not materialize 

we also have entered into multiyear fixedprice contracts with some of our customers pursuant to which we have agreed to perform the work for a fixed price and accordingly realize all the benefit or detriment resulting from any decreases or increases in the costs of making these products sometimes we accept a fixedprice contract for a product that we have not yet produced and this increases the risk of cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product most of our contracts do not permit us to recover increases in raw material prices taxes or labor costs 

we intend to pursue acquisitions our business may be adversely affected if we cannot consummate acquisitions on satisfactory terms or if we cannot effectively integrate acquired operations 

a significant portion of our growth has occurred through acquisitions any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions we intend to pursue acquisitions that we believe will present opportunities consistent with our overall business strategy however we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates to purchase or may be unable to acquire desired businesses or assets on economically acceptable terms or may be unable to receive necessary regulatory approvals or support in addition we may not be able to raise the capital necessary to fund future acquisitions because we may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously we may encounter unforeseen expenses complications and delays including regulatory complications or difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight 

we regularly engage in discussions with respect to potential acquisition and investment opportunities if we consummate an acquisition our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly future acquisitions could result in margin dilution and further likely result in the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest and amortization expenses or periodic impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets as well as significant charges relating to integration costs 

acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect in addition we may not be able to successfully integrate any business we acquire into our existing business the successful integration of new businesses with the most significant recent acquisition being the esterline acquisition in march 2019 depends on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs the successful integration of future acquisitions may also require substantial attention from our senior management and the management of the acquired business which could decrease the time that they have to service attract customers and develop new products and services or attend to other acquisition opportunities 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and could harm our ability to react to changes to our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of september 30 2020 our total indebtedness excluding approximately 394 million of letters of credit outstanding was approximately 200 billion which was 1248 of our total book capitalization we incurred approximately 31 billion in net new incremental borrowings during fiscal 2020 both for general corporate purposes and as a precautionary response to macroeconomic conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic 

in addition we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future as of september 30 2020 we had approximately 5206 million of unused commitments under our revolving loan facility although our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the various senior secured and senior subordinated notes outstanding the “indentures” contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these qualifications and exceptions could be substantial a breach of any of the covenants or an inability to comply with the required leverage ratio could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the indentures 

an increase in our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to investors for example it could 

• increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions 

• increase the risk we are subjected to downgrade or put on a negative watch by the ratings agencies 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital requirements capital expenditures acquisitions research and development efforts and other general corporate requirements 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 

• place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt and 

• limit along with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in the documents governing our indebtedness among other things our ability to borrow additional funds make investments and incur liens 

all of our debt under the senior secured credit facility which includes 74 billion in term loans and a revolving loan facility of 760 million bears interest at variable rates primarily based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” for deposits of us dollars accordingly if libor or other variable interest rates increase our debt service expense will also increase in order to mitigate the interest rate risk of these variable rate borrowings we are entered into interest rate swap and cap agreements that covers a significant portion of the existing variable rate debt for information about our interest rate swap and cap agreements see note 21 “derivatives and hedging instruments” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

in addition on july 27 2017 the financial conduct authority “fca” in the united kingdom “uk” announced that it would phase out libor as a benchmark by the end of calendar year 2021 as a result in february 2020 we amended our senior secured credit facility to incorporate an alternative reference rate effective upon the cessation date of libor we will also take the necessary steps to amend our interest rate swap and cap agreements the expected cessation of libor may require us to amend certain other agreements and although the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” is expected to be the alternative rate that replaces libor we cannot predict what margin adjustments and related terms would be negotiated with our counterparties as a result our interest expense could increase 

our indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness including the indentures we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital 

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness including the indentures amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility amounts due under our trade receivable securitization facility “securitization facility” and to fund our operations will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future which to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness including the amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility amounts borrowed under our securitization facility and the indentures or to fund our other liquidity needs if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital we cannot assure that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations the terms of existing or future debt instruments the securitization facility the indentures and the senior secured credit facility may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives in addition any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms and would otherwise adversely affect the indentures 

the terms of the senior secured credit facility and indentures may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

our senior secured credit facility and the indentures contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indentures and may limit their ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests the senior secured credit facility and indentures include covenants restricting among other things the ability of td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indentures to 

• incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock 

• pay distributions on redeem or repurchase our capital stock or redeem or repurchase our subordinated debt 

• make investments 

• sell assets 

• enter into agreements that restrict distributions or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us 

• incur or allow to exist liens 

• consolidate merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets 

• engage in transactions with affiliates 

• create unrestricted subsidiaries and 

• engage in certain business activities 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the indentures if any such default occurs the lenders under the senior secured credit facility and the holders of the senior secured and senior subordinated notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder to be immediately due and payable the lenders under the senior secured credit facility also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings in addition following an event of default under the senior secured credit facility the lenders under that facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which includes our available cash and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the senior subordinated notes if the debt under the senior secured credit facility or the senior secured or subordinated notes were to be accelerated we cannot assure that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt 

we are dependent on our senior management team and highly trained employees and any work stoppage or difficulty hiring similar employees could adversely affect our business 

because our products are complicated and highly engineered we depend on an educated and trained workforce historically there has been substantial competition for skilled personnel in the aerospace and defense industry and we could be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled employees we may not be able to fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover or attract and retain qualified personnel 

reduction in force actions such as the actions taken to reduce our workforce to align operations with customer demand as a result of the covid19 pandemic could result in difficulty in rehiring capable employees to refill the positions eliminated as needed once business recovers 

although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory we cannot assure that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory renewal of collective bargaining agreements or that our employee relations will remain stable because we strive to limit the volume of finished goods inventory any work stoppage could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide products to our customers 

in addition our success depends in part on our ability to attract and motivate our senior management and key employees achieving this objective may be difficult due to a variety of factors including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions competitors’ hiring practices and the effectiveness of our compensation programs competition for qualified personnel can be intense a loss of senior management and key personnel or failure to attract qualified new talent could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and our operating results andor market value could be adversely affected the company’s board of directors continually monitors this risk and we believe that the board of director’s succession plan together with our straightforward strategy clear value drivers decentralized nature and the quality of managers running our operating units helps to mitigate this risk 

risks related to our operations 

our sales to manufacturers of aircraft are cyclical and a downturn in sales to these manufacturers may adversely affect us 

our sales to manufacturers of large commercial aircraft such as the boeing company airbus sas and related oem suppliers as well as manufacturers of business jets have historically experienced periodic downturns in the past these sales have been affected by airline profitability which is impacted by among other things fuel and labor costs price competition interest rates downturns in the global economy and national and international events in addition sales of our products to manufacturers of business jets are impacted by among other things downturns in the global economy in particular commercial and business jet market channel sales have been negatively impacted by the ongoing covid19 pandemic downturns adversely affect our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

our business is dependent on the availability of certain components and raw materials from suppliers 

our business is affected by the price and availability of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our components our business therefore could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our suppliers such as the destruction of our suppliers’ facilities or their distribution infrastructure a work stoppage or strike by our suppliers’ employees or the failure of our suppliers to provide materials of the requisite quality or by increased costs of such raw materials or components if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers the covid19 pandemic has also disrupted the global supply chain to a certain extent because we strive to limit the volume of raw materials and component parts on hand our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers or alternative raw materials or component parts the lengthy and expensive faa and oem certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier raw material or component part 

we face significant competition 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry and compete against a number of companies competitors in our product lines are both us and foreign companies and range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privatelyheld entities we believe that our ability to compete depends on high product performance consistent high quality short leadtime and timely delivery competitive pricing superior customer service and support and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs we may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive 

our operations depend on our manufacturing facilities which are subject to physical and other risks that could disrupt production 

a number of our manufacturing facilities are located in the greater los angeles area an area known for earthquakes and fires and are thus vulnerable to damage in addition a number of our manufacturing facilities are located along the eastern seaboard area susceptible to hurricanes we are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters including power loss fire explosions floods communications failures terrorist attacks and similar events disruptions could also occur due to healthrelated outbreaks and crises cyberattacks computer or equipment malfunction accidental or intentional operator error or process failures should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms such as our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans be insufficient to recover all costs we could experience a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

operations and sales outside of the united states may be subject to additional risks 

a number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including global health crises currency fluctuations difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies restrictions on the repatriation of funds change in trade policies tariff regulation difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition issues with the global supply chain can also rise due to some of the aforementioned risks as well as global health crises such as the covid19 pandemic furthermore the company is subject to laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act uk bribery act and similar local antibribery laws which generally prohibit companies and their employees agents and contractors from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure to comply with these laws could subject the company to civil and criminal penalties that could materially adversely affect the company’s results of operations financial position and cash flows 

in june 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” the uk subsequently withdrew from the european union on january 31 2020 subject to a transition period that is set to end on december 31 2020 although it is unknown what the terms of the uks relationship with the eu will be it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the uk and eu countries and increased regulatory complexities these changes could cause disruptions to and create uncertainty surrounding our business and the business of existing and future customers and suppliers as well as have an impact on our employees based in europe which could adversely impact our business the actual effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to eu markets either during a transitional period or more permanently 

we are subject to certain unique business risks as a result of supplying equipment and services to the us government 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies whether through direct contracts with the us government or a as a subcontractor to customers contracting with the us government are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 

• suspend us from receiving new contracts based on alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations 

• terminate existing contracts 

• revoke required security clearances 

• reduce the value of existing contracts and 

• audit our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs 

most of our us government contracts can be terminated by the us government at its convenience without significant notice termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination 

on contracts for which the price is based on cost the us government may review our costs and performance as well as our accounting and general business practices based on the results of such audits the us government may adjust our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs in addition under us government purchasing regulations some of our costs including most financing costs amortization of intangible assets portions of research and development costs and certain marketing expenses may not be subject to reimbursement 

furthermore even where the price is not based on cost the us government may seek to review our costs to determine whether our pricing is “fair and reasonable” our subsidiaries are periodically subject to pricing reviews and government buying agencies that purchase some of our subsidiaries’ products are periodically subject to audits by the dod office of inspector general “oig” with respect to prices paid for such products in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 we voluntarily refunded 16 million to the us government following an oig audit and another oig audit is underway in addition our defenserelated business is the subject of an ongoing congressional inquiry by the house oversight committee pricing reviews and government audits including the audit underway and the congressional inquiry are costly and time consuming for our management and could distract from our ability to effectively manage the business as a result of these reviews audits and inquiries we could be subject to providing further refunds to the us government we could be asked to enter into an arrangement whereby our prices would be based on cost the dod could seek to pursue alternative sources of supply for our parts or the us government could take other adverse actions with respect to our contracts any of those occurrences could lead to a reduction in our revenue from or the profitability of certain of our supply arrangements with certain agencies and buying organizations of the us government further negative publicity relating to the results of any audit inquiry or subsequent hearing or the like could negatively impact our stock price 

if a government inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions including contract termination fines forfeiture of fees suspension of payment and suspension or debarment from doing business with us government agencies any of which could materially adversely affect our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

moreover us government purchasing regulations contain a number of additional operational requirements which do not apply to entities not engaged in government contracting failure to comply with such government contracting requirements could result in civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

our business may be adversely affected if we would lose our government or industry approvals or if more stringent government regulations are enacted or if industry oversight is increased 

the aerospace industry is highly regulated in the us and in other countries in order to sell our products we and the products we manufacture must be certified by the faa the dod and similar agencies in foreign countries and by individual manufacturers if new and more stringent government regulations are adopted or if industry oversight increases we might incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or heightened industry oversight in addition if material authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended our business would be adversely affected 

in addition to the aviation approvals we are at times required to obtain approval from us government agencies to export our products us laws and regulations applicable to us include the arms export control act the international traffic in arms regulations itar the export administration regulations ear and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the united states department of the treasurys office of foreign assets control ofac ear restricts the export of dualuse products and technical data to certain countries while itar restricts the export of defense products technical data and defense services 

failure to obtain approval to export or determination by the us government that we failed to receive required approvals or licenses could eliminate or restrict our ability to sell our products outside the united states and the penalties that could be imposed by the us government for failure to comply with these laws could be significant 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of data protection concerns 

the interpretation and application of data protection laws in the us europe including but not limited to the general data protection regulation the “gdpr” and the california consumer privacy act the “ccpa” and elsewhere are uncertain and evolving it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices complying with these various laws is difficult and could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business further although we have implemented internal controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the gdpr ccpa and other privacyrelated laws rules and regulations collectively the “data protection laws” there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures will enable us to be fully compliant with all data protection laws 

despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data comply with applicable laws rules and regulations and implement data security measures our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches and other data loss including cyberattacks and in fact we have experienced data security incidents that have not had a material impact on our financial results in addition it is not possible to predict the impact on our business of the future loss alteration or misappropriation of information in our possession related to us our employees former employees customers suppliers or others this could lead to negative publicity legal claims theft modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information damage to or inaccessibility of critical systems manufacture of defective products production downtimes operational disruptions and other significant costs which could adversely affect our reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

risks related to legal and regulatory matters 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations 

our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things discharges of pollutants into the air and water the generation handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees environmental laws and regulations may require that the company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations certain facilities and thirdparty sites utilized by subsidiaries of the company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws the company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws 

estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are based on current facts laws regulations and technology these estimates take into consideration the company’s prior experience and professional judgment of the company’s environmental advisors estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination the range of remediation alternatives available evolving remediation standards imprecise engineering evaluations and cost estimates the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 

accordingly as investigations and remediations proceed it is likely that adjustments in the company’s accruals will be necessary to reflect new information the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in a given period based on currently available information however the company does not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition 

we may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings including fair labor standards act and state wage and hour class action lawsuits which may adversely affect our business and financial performance 

from time to time we are involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of business these actions and proceedings may involve claims for among other things compensation for alleged personal injury workers’ compensation employment discrimination or breach of contract in addition we may be subject to class action lawsuits including those involving allegations of violations of consumer product statutes or the fair labor standards act and state wage and hour laws due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions or proceedings the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions is difficult to assess or quantify as plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts in these types of lawsuits and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition plaintiffs in many types of actions may seek punitive damages civil penalties consequential damages or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief these proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves the ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement mediation or court judgment could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we could be adversely affected if one of our products cause an aircraft to crash 

our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft product that we have designed manufactured or serviced while we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future product liability claims in the event of product liability claims our insurers may attempt to deny coverage or any coverage we have may not be adequate we also may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost any liability not covered by insurance or for which third party indemnification is not available could result in significant liability to us 

in addition a crash caused by one of our products could damage our reputation for quality products we believe our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting a provider of aircraft products if a crash were to be caused by one of our products or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected 

risks related to financial matters 

we have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets which may never generate the returns we expect 

mergers and acquisitions have resulted in significant increases in identifiable intangible assets and goodwill identifiable intangible assets which primarily include trademarks trade names customer relationships and technology were approximately 26 billion at september 30 2020 representing approximately 14 of our total assets goodwill recognized in accounting for the mergers and acquisitions was approximately 79 billion at september 30 2020 representing approximately 43 of our total assets we may never realize the full value of our identifiable intangible assets and goodwill and to the extent we were to determine that our identifiable intangible assets or our goodwill were impaired within the meaning of applicable accounting standards we would be required to writeoff the amount of any impairment 

volatility in the equity markets or interest rates could substantially increase our pension costs and required pension contributions 

the company sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans certain qualified defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities and other investments among other factors changes in interest rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can i affect the level of plan funding ii cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost and iii increase our future contribution requirements a significant decrease in investment returns or the market value of plan assets or a significant decrease in interest rates could increase our net periodic pension costs and adversely affect our results of operations a significant increase in our contribution requirements with respect to our qualified defined benefit pension plans could have an adverse impact on our cash flows 

we may be subject to risks relating to changes in its tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and various nonus jurisdictions the company’s domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions the company’s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the company’s effective tax rate as a result of changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets challenges by tax authorities or changes in tax laws or regulations in addition the amount of income taxes paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company’s tax liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

we do not regularly declare and pay quarterly or annual cash dividends on our stock 

notwithstanding special cash dividends of which the most recent declaration by the company’s board of directors occurred on december 20 2019 in the amount of 3250 per outstanding share of common stock and and cash dividend equivalent payments on options granted under its equity compensation plans we do not anticipate declaring regular quarterly or annual cash dividends on our common stock or any other equity security in the foreseeable future 

the amounts that may be available to us to pay future special cash dividends are restricted under our debt and other agreements any payment of special cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations earnings capital requirements financial condition future prospects contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors therefore shareholders should not rely on regular quarterly or annual dividend income from shares of our common stock and should not rely on special dividends with any regularity or at all 

general risks 

we face risks related to the current covid19 pandemic and other health pandemics epidemics and outbreaks  

the global outbreak of covid19 is currently impacting countries communities supply chains and markets the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted our commercial oem and commercial aftermarket sales and will continue to do so for an indeterminate length of time the impact of the covid19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve and therefore we cannot predict the extent to which our business results of operations financial condition or cash flows will ultimately be impacted because this situation is ongoing and because the duration and severity of the outbreak are unclear it is difficult to forecast the impact on the company’s future results however we currently expect covid19 to have a significant adverse impact on our sales net income and ebitda as defined continuing at least into fiscal 2021 under the assumption that the covid19 outbreak will adversely affect our nondefense customers and their demand for our products and services for at least the near term 

the covid19 pandemic has also disrupted our operations the outbreak of covid19 has heightened the risk that a significant portion of our workforce will suffer illness or otherwise be unable to work furthermore in light of our reduction in workforce to align operations with customer demand caused by the covid19 pandemic we cannot assure that we will be able to rehire our entire workforce once our business has recovered certain of our facilities have experienced temporary disruptions as a result of the covid19 pandemic and we cannot predict whether our facilities will experience more significant disruptions in the future furthermore our acquisition strategy which is a key element of our overall business strategy may be impacted by our efforts to maintain the company’s liquidity position in response to the covid19 pandemic finally future public health crises are possible and could involve some or all of the risks described above 

our commercial business is sensitive to the number of flight hours that our customers’ planes spend aloft the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and our customers’ profitability these items are in turn affected by general economic and geopolitical and other worldwide conditions 

our commercial business is directly affected by among other factors changes in rpms the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet the percentage of the fleet that is outofwarranty and changes in the profitability of the commercial airline industry rpms and airline profitability have historically been correlated with the general economic environment although national and international events also play a key role for example in addition to the current covid19 pandemic and the adverse impact it has had on the airline industry past examples in which the airline industry has been negatively affected include downturns in the global economy higher fuel prices increased security concerns among airline customers following the events of september 11 2001 the severe acute respiratory syndrome “sars” epidemic and conflicts abroad additional examples include future geopolitical or other worldwide events such as war terrorist acts or additional worldwide infectious disease outbreaks 

in addition global market and economic conditions have been challenging due to turbulence in the us and international markets and economies and have prolonged declines in business and consumer spending as a result of the substantial reduction in airline traffic resulting from the aforementioned events the airline industry incurred large losses and financial difficulties some carriers have also parked or retired a portion of their fleets and have reduced workforces and flights during periods of reduced airline profitability some airlines may delay purchases of spare parts preferring instead to deplete existing inventories and delay refurbishments and discretionary spending if demand for spare parts decreases there would be a decrease in demand for certain of our products an adverse change in demand could impact our results of operations collection of accounts receivable and our expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses which may adversely impact our financial condition and access to capital markets 

us military spending is dependent upon the us defense budget 

the military and defense market is significantly dependent upon government budget trends particularly the dod budget in addition to normal business risks our supply of products to the us government is subject to unique risks largely beyond our control dod budgets could be negatively impacted by several factors including but not limited to a change in defense spending policy as a result of the presidential election or otherwise the us government’s budget deficits spending priorities eg allocating more spending to combat the effects of the covid19 pandemic the cost of sustaining the us military presence internationally and possible political pressure to reduce us government military spending each of which could cause the dod budget to remain unchanged or to decline a significant decline in us military expenditures could result in a reduction in the amount of our products sold to the various agencies and buying organizations of the us government 

our stock price may be volatile and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 

there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities which is unrelated to the operating performance of the companies issuing the securities these market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock shareholders may not be able to sell their shares at or above the purchase price due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock such changes could be caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects including possible changes due to the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry and other factors such as fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering which could cause shortterm swings in profit margins or such changes could be unrelated to our operating performance such as changes in market conditions affecting the stock market generally or the stocks of aerospace companies or changes in the outlook for our common stock such as changes to or the confidence in our business strategy changes to or confidence in our management or expectations for future growth of the company global health crises such as the current covid19 pandemic with the breadth of its impact worldwide could also cause significant volatility in the market price

during march 2020 the company repurchased 36900 shares of its common stock at a gross cost of 189 million at the weighted average cost of 51267 under the 650 million stock repurchase plan no repurchases were made under the program during the fiscal year ended september 30 2019 as of september 30 2020 6311 million in repurchases are allowable under the program subject to any restrictions specified in the credit agreement and indentures governing the existing notes 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected financial data” and td group’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report the following discussion may contain predictions estimates and other forwardlooking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties including those discussed under the heading entitled “risk factors” included elsewhere in this report these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 

overview 

for fiscal year 2020 we generated net sales of 5103 million gross profit of 2647 million or 519 of sales and net income attributable to td group of 699 million while the covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted our operations in the shortterm we believe we have achieved steady longterm growth in sales and improvements in operating performance since our formation in 1993 due to our competitive strengths and through execution of our valuedriven operating strategy more specifically focusing our businesses on our valuedriven operating strategy of obtaining profitable new business carefully controlling the cost structure and pricing our highly engineered valueadded products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so has historically resulted in improvements in gross profit and income from operations over the long term 

our selective acquisition strategy has also contributed to the growth of our business the integration of certain acquisitions into our existing businesses combined with implementing our proven operating strategy has historically resulted in improvements of the financial performance of the acquired business 

we believe our key competitive strengths include 

large and growing installed product base with aftermarket revenue stream we provide components to a large and growing installed base of aircraft to which we supply aftermarket products we estimate that our products are installed on over 100000 commercial transport regional transport military and general aviation fixed wing turbine aircraft and rotary wing aircraft 

diversified revenue base we believe that our diversified revenue base reduces our dependence on any particular product platform or market channel and has been a significant factor in maintaining our financial performance our products are installed on almost all of the major commercial aircraft platforms now in production we expect to continue to develop new products for military and commercial applications as a result of the covid19 pandemic many of our businesses have taken the opportunity to explore new business opportunities by working on developing highly engineered solutions for emerging needs arising from the pandemic product solutions currently being explored include antiviral or antimicrobial technology air purification and touchless technologies among others 

barriers to entry  we believe that the niche nature of our markets the industry’s stringent regulatory and certification requirements the large number of products that we sell and the investments necessary to develop and certify products create potential disincentives to competition for certain products 

our business strategy is made up of two key elements 1 a valuedriven operating strategy focused around our three core value drivers and 2 a selective acquisition strategy 

valuedriven operating strategy our three core value drivers are 

• obtaining profitable new business we attempt to obtain profitable new business by using our technical expertise and application skill and our detailed knowledge of our customer base and the individual niche markets in which we operate we have regularly been successful in identifying and developing both aftermarket and oem products to drive our growth 

• improving our cost structure we are committed to maintaining and continuously improving our lean cost structure through detailed attention to the cost of each of the products that we offer and our organizational structure with a focus on reducing the cost of each 

• providing highly engineered valueadded products to customers we focus on the engineering manufacturing and marketing of a broad range of highly engineered niche products that we believe provide value to our customers we believe we have been consistently successful in communicating to our customers the value of our products this has generally enabled us to price our products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so 

selective acquisition strategy we selectively pursue the acquisition of proprietary aerospace component businesses when we see an opportunity to create value through the application of our three core valuedriven operating strategies the aerospace industry in particular remains highly fragmented with many of the companies in the industry being small private businesses or small noncore operations of larger businesses we have significant experience among our management team in executing acquisitions and integrating acquired businesses into our company and culture as of the date of this report we have successfully acquired approximately 85 businesses and product lines since our formation in 1993 many of these acquisitions have been integrated into an existing transdigm production facility which enables a higher production capacity utilization which in turn improves gross profit levels due to the ability to spread the fixed manufacturing overhead costs over higher production volume 

acquisitions and divestitures during the most recent three fiscal years are more fully described in note 2 “acquisitions and divestitures” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

impact of the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic caused a significant adverse impact on our sales net income and ebitda as defined for fiscal 2020 and is expected to continue to do so into fiscal 2021 this is under the assumption that the covid19 pandemic will continue to adversely impact customer demand for all market channels with commercial oem and commercial aftermarket being the most adversely impacted due to the pandemics impact on air travel worldwide the defense market channel is also impacted to a lesser extent due to certain supply chain disruptions as well as the stay at home orders quarantines etc impacting the government procurement workforce which has slowed production andor orders also government funding reprioritization such as shifting funds to efforts to combat the impact of the pandemic provides for uncertainty the magnitude of the impact of covid19 remains unpredictable and we therefore continue to anticipate potential supply chain disruptions employee absenteeism and shortterm suspensions of manufacturing facilities and additional health and safety costs related to the covid19 pandemic that could unfavorably impact our business longer term because the duration of the pandemic is unclear it is difficult to forecast a precise impact on the company’s future results as a result of the covid19 pandemic many of our businesses have taken the opportunity to explore new business opportunities by working on developing highly engineered solutions for emerging needs arising from the pandemic product solutions currently being explored include antiviral or antimicrobial technology air purification and touchless technologies among others 

the company took immediate and aggressive action to minimize the spread of covid19 in our workplaces and reduce costs since the early days of the pandemic we have been following guidance from the world health organization and the us center for disease control to protect employees and prevent the spread of the virus within all of our facilities globally some of the actions implemented included flexible workfromhome scheduling alternate shift schedules preshift temperature screenings where allowed by law social distancing appropriate personal protective equipment facility deep cleaning and paid quarantine time for impacted employees material actions to reduce costs included 1 reducing its workforce to align operations with customer demand 2 implementing unpaid furloughs and salary reductions and 3 delaying nonessential capital projects and minimizing discretionary spending 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 covid19 restructuring costs incurred were approximately 46 million of which 37 million was recorded in cost of sales and 9 million was recorded in selling and administrative expenses these were costs related to the companys actions to reduce its workforce to align with customer demand additionally the company incurred approximately 5 million in incremental costs related to the pandemic that are not expected to recur once the pandemic has subsided and are clearly separable from normal operations eg additional cleaning and disinfecting of facilities by contractors above and beyond normal requirements personal protective equipment etc 

as of september 30 2020 the restructuring accrual associated with the costs incurred in response to the covid19 pandemic was approximately 13 million the company expects to incur and pay additional restructuring costs during fiscal 2021 related to the covid19 pandemic though at a reduced level in comparison to fiscal 2020 the company continues to analyze its cost structure and may implement additional cost reduction measures as necessary due to the ongoing business challenges resulting from the covid19 pandemic 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with us gaap which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations however investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 

below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions for additional significant accounting policies see note 3 “summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

revenue recognition  revenue is recognized from the sale of products when control transfers to the customer which is demonstrated by our right to payment a transfer of title a transfer of the risk and rewards of ownership or the customer acceptance but most frequently upon shipment where the customer obtains physical possession of the goods the majority of the companys revenue is recorded at a point in time sales recognized over time are generally accounted for using an input measure to determine progress completed at the end of the period sales for service contracts generally are recognized as the services are provided for agreements with multiple performance obligations judgment is required to determine whether performance obligations specified in these agreements are distinct and should be accounted for as separate revenue transactions for recognition purposes based on the standalone selling price of each performance obligation the primary method used to estimate a standalone selling price is the price observed in standalone sales to customers for the same product or service we consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assesses variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price variable consideration is included in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount including whether the estimate should be constrained in order to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in a future period these estimates are based on historical experience anticipated performance under the terms of the contract and our best judgment at the time 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost of inventories is generally determined by the average cost and the firstin firstout “fifo” methods and includes material labor and overhead related to the manufacturing process because the company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be inservice for 25 or more years it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use where management estimated that the net realizable value was below cost or determined that future demand was lower than current inventory levels based on historical experience current and projected market demand current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value was made by recording a provision included in cost of sales although management believes that the company’s estimates of excess and obsolete inventory are reasonable actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future in addition in accordance with industry practice all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year historically changes in estimates in the net realizable value of inventories have not been significant 

goodwill and other intangible assets  in accordance with asc 805 “business combinations” the company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized as goodwill the valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows revenue growth rates discount rates customer attrition rates royalty rates asset lives and market multiples among other items we determine the fair values of intangible assets acquired generally in consultation with thirdparty valuation advisors fair value adjustments to the company’s assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition  

intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights or if the intangible asset can be sold transferred licensed or exchanged regardless of the company’s intent to do so goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition and are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates 

us gaap requires that the annual and any interim impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level the reporting unit level is one level below an operating segment substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each reporting unit pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction with respect to acquisitions integrated into an existing reporting unit any acquired goodwill is combined with the goodwill of the reporting unit 

at the time of goodwill impairment testing the company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test the quantitative test is required only if the company concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount or if the company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit for the quantitative test management determines the estimated fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit if the calculated estimated fair value is less than the current carrying value impairment of goodwill of the reporting unit may exist the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing includes discount rates growth rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates are set by using the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” methodology the wacc methodology considers market and industry data as well as company specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business 

management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit terminal value rate determination follows a common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates 

given the adverse global economic and market conditions attributable to the covid19 pandemic particularly as it pertains to the commercial sector of the aerospace and defense industry the company determined that an interim impairment evaluation of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets was necessary as of march 28 2020 for certain reporting units in which it was concluded a potential impairment existed for the identified reporting units a step 1 impairment test was performed using an income approach based on management’s determination of the prospective financial information with consideration taken of the existing uncertainty in the global economy and aerospace and defense industry particularly the commercial sector management also included projected declines and subsequent recovery in commercial oem and aftermarket as a percentage of sales based on available industry data the company utilized a third party valuation firm to assist in the determination of the wacc the results of this test indicated the fair value exceeded carrying value for all reporting units tested 

the company had 49 reporting units with goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 the date of the annual impairment test based on its initial qualitative assessment over each of the reporting units the company identified 19 reporting units to test for impairment using step 1 of the quantitative test the estimated fair value of each of these reporting units was in excess of its respective carrying value and therefore no goodwill impairment was recorded the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate which is a significant assumption in the calculation of fair values with a one percentage point increase in the discount rate all of the reporting units would continue to have fair values in excess of their respective carrying values 

management tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at the asset level as determined by appropriate asset valuation at the time of acquisition the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets consists of a comparison between the estimated fair values and carrying values if the carrying amounts of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives exceed their estimated fair values an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference management utilizes the royalty savings valuation method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset in this method management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset the key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates royalty rates growth rates sales projections and terminal value rates discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the wacc methodology considering any differences in companyspecific risk factors between reporting units and the indefinitelived intangible assets royalty rates are established by management with the advice of valuation experts management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant intangible asset terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates 

the discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed actual results could differ from these assumptions management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering the current economic conditions 

stockbased compensation  the cost of the company’s stockbased compensation is recorded in accordance with asc 718 “stock compensation” the company uses a blackscholes pricing model to estimate the grantdate fair value of the stock options awarded the blackscholes pricing model requires assumptions regarding the expected volatility of the company’s common shares the riskfree interest rate the expected life of the stock options award and the company’s dividend yield the company utilizes historical data in determining the assumptions an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside of management’s control could have an impact on the blackscholes pricing model the company estimates stock option forfeitures based on historical data the total number of stock options expected to vest is adjusted by actual and estimated forfeitures changes to the actual and estimated forfeitures will result in a cumulative adjustment in the period of change the company also evaluates any subsequent changes to the respective option holders terms under the modification rules of asc 718 if determined to be a modification the blackscholes pricing model is updated as of the date of the modification resulting in a cumulative catch up to expense 

income taxes  the company estimates income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates this involves estimating taxable earnings specific taxable and deductible items the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits to the extent these estimates change adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes are made in the period in which the changes occur historically such adjustments have not been significant 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain operating data of the company including presentation of the amounts as a percentage of net sales amounts in millions 



fiscal year ended september 30 2020 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2019 

total company 

• net sales  net organic sales and acquisition sales and the related dollar and percentage changes for the fiscal years ended september 30 2020 and 2019 were as follows amounts in millions 



the decrease in organic sales for the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 compared to the fiscal year ended september 30 2019 is primarily related to decreases in commercial aftermarket sales 410 million a decrease of 257 commercial oem sales 355 million a decrease of 245 and other nonaerospace sales 9 million a decrease of 34 partially offset by an increase in defense sales 49 million an increase of 25 

the decreases in the commercial aftermarket and commercial oem markets are attributable to the adverse impact that the covid19 pandemic had on customer demand beginning in march 2020 due to the pandemics impact on air travel demand worldwide commercial oem sales were also adversely impacted by the 737 max production slowdown the increase in defense sales is primarily attributable to sales growth in the power  control segment 59 million 

acquisition sales represent sales of acquired businesses for the period up to one year subsequent to their respective acquisition date the acquisition sales in the table above were attributable to the sales recorded by the esterline businesses 

• cost of sales and gross profit  cost of sales increased by 42 million or 17 to 2456 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 compared to 2414 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2019 cost of sales and the related percentage of total sales for the fiscal years ended september 30 2020 and 2019 were as follows amounts in millions 



the increase in the dollar amount of cost of sales during the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 was primarily due to a full fiscal year of ownership of the esterline businesses in fiscal 2020 compared to approximately 65 months of ownership in fiscal 2019 in addition to the other factors summarized above 

gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased by 19 percentage points to 519 for the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 from 538 for the fiscal year ended september 30 2019 the decrease in the gross profit percentage is primarily driven by the sales mix specifically lower commercial aftermarket sales the dilutive effect a full year of esterline sales have on the gross profit percentage as integration activities associated with the three core value drivers continued into fiscal 2020 covid19 restructuring charges and foreign currency losses partially offset by a reduction in inventory acquisition accounting adjustments also fixed overhead costs incurred were spread over a lower production volume resulting in an adverse impact to gross profit during the second half of fiscal 2020 

• selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses decreased by 21 million to 727 million or 142 of sales for the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 from 748 million or 143 of sales for the comparable period in the prior year selling and administrative expenses and the related percentage of total sales for the fiscal years ended september 30 2020 and 2019 were as follows amounts in millions 



the decrease in total selling and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 is primarily due to lower acquisitionrelated expenses and cost mitigation measures enacted during the second half of fiscal 2020 in response to the covid19 pandemic the material cost mitigation measures enacted beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 are described in note 1 description of the business and impact of covid19 pandemic in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein partially offsetting the decrease in selling and administrative expenses is an increase in selling and administrative expenses as a result of a full fiscal year of ownership of the esterline businesses in fiscal 2020 compared to approximately 65 months of ownership in fiscal 2019 

• amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets was 169 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 compared to 135 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2019 the increase in amortization expense of 34 million was primarily due to the amortization expense on the definitelived intangible assets recorded in connection with the fiscal 2019 acquisition of esterline 

• interest expensenet interest expensenet includes interest on borrowings outstanding amortization of debt issuance costs original issue discount and premium and revolving credit facility fees slightly offset by interest income interest expensenet increased 170 million or 198 to 1029 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 from 859 million for the comparable period in the prior year the increase in interest expensenet was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average level of outstanding borrowings which was approximately 191 billion for the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 compared to approximately 155 billion for the fiscal year ended september 30 2019 the increase in the weighted average level of borrowings was primarily due to the activity in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 consisting of the issuance of 40 billion in 2026 secured notes and the issuance of 550 million in 750 2027 notes and the activity in fiscal 2020 consisting of the issuance of 265 billion in 550 2027 notes 11 billion in 2025 secured notes 400 million in 625 2026 new notes and a 200 million draw on the revolving credit facility the increases in new debt described above were slightly offset by the redemptions of 550 million in 550 senior subordinated notes the “2020 notes” in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and 115 billion in 600 senior subordinated notes the “2022 notes” in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 the weighted average interest rate for cash interest payments on total borrowings outstanding for the period ended september 30 2020 was 522

for our results of operations for fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 refer to the discussion in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” of form 10k for the fiscal year ended september 30 2019 as filed with the securities and exchange commission on november 19 2019 

backlog 

for information about our backlog see item 1 “business” 

foreign operations 

our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately 1696 million 1778 million and 1355 million for the fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks including the covid19 pandemic foreign currency fluctuations the impact of foreign government regulations political uncertainties and differences in business practices there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments’ countries furthermore there can be no assurance that the political cultural and economic climate outside the us will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 

inflation 

many of the company’s raw materials and operating expenses are sensitive to the effects of inflation which could result in changing operating costs furthermore recently implemented changes to the us and other countries’ tariff and importexport regulations may have an unfavorable impact on raw materials pricing the effects of inflation on the company’s businesses during the fiscal years 2020 2019 and 2018 were immaterial 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically maintained a capital structure comprising a mix of equity and debt financing we vary our leverage both to optimize our equity return and to pursue acquisitions we expect to meet our current debt obligations as they come due through internally generated funds from current levels of operations andor through refinancing in the debt markets prior to the maturity dates of our debt 

if the company has excess cash it generally prioritizes allocating the excess cash in the following manner 1 capital spending at existing businesses 2 acquisitions of businesses 3 payment of a special dividend andor repurchases of our common stock and 4 prepayment of indebtedness or repurchase of debt whether the company undertakes common stock repurchases or other aforementioned activities will depend on prevailing market conditions the companys liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material in addition the company may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so 

the company’s ability to make scheduled interest payments on or to refinance the company’s indebtedness or to fund nonacquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on the company’s ability to generate cash in the future this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control including the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has caused a significant adverse impact on our sales net income and ebitda as defined for the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 and is expected to continue to do so into fiscal 2021 this is under the assumption that the covid19 pandemic will continue to adversely impact customer demand for all market channels with commercial oem and commercial aftermarket being the most adversely impacted due to the pandemics impact on air travel worldwide the defense market channel is also impacted to a lesser extent due to certain supply chain disruptions as well as the stay at home orders quarantines etc impacting the government procurement workforce which has slowed production andor orders also government funding reprioritization such as shifting funds to efforts to combat the impact of the pandemic provides for uncertainty the magnitude of the impact of covid19 remains unpredictable and we therefore continue to anticipate potential supply chain disruptions employee absenteeism and shortterm suspensions of manufacturing facilities and additional health and safety costs related to the covid19 pandemic that could unfavorabl y impact our business longer term because the duration of the pandemic is unclear it is difficult to forecast a precise impact on the company’s future results 

the company is actively managing the business to maintain cash flow including the cost mitigation efforts described in note 1 description of the business and impact of covid19 pandemic in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein in response to the covid19 pandemic and is continuing to focus on the application of its three core valuedriven operating strategies obtaining profitable new business continually improving its cost structure and providing highly engineered valueadded products to customers 

in march 2020 the president of the united states signed the cares act a substantial taxandspending package intended to provide additional economic stimulus to address the impact of the covid19 pandemic the cares act among other things includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits deferment of employer social security payments net operating loss carryback periods alternative minimum tax credit refunds and modifications to the net interest deduction limitations the most significant impact of the cares act for the company is an increase of the irc 163j interest disallowance limitations from 30 to 50 of adjusted taxable income which will allow the company to deduct additional interest for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 

in march 2020 the company drew 200 million on its revolving credit facility to increase the companys liquidity as a precautionary response to macroeconomic conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic also in further action to increase the companys liquidity the company executed two notes offerings in april 2020 in which the proceeds received are for general corporate purposes on april 8 2020 the company entered into a purchase agreement in connection with a private offering of 1100 million in aggregate principal amount of 800 senior secured notes due 2025 at an issue price of 100 of the principal amount on april 17 2020 the company entered into a purchase agreement in connection with a private offering of 400 million in aggregate principal amount of 625 senior secured notes due 2026 at an issue price of 101 of the principal amount 

as of september 30 2020 the company has significant cash liquidity as illustrated in the table presented below in millions 



we believe our significant cash liquidity will allow us to meet our anticipated funding requirements we expect to meet our shortterm cash liquidity requirements including interest obligations and capital expenditures through net cash from operating activities cash on hand and if needed additional draws on the revolving credit facility longterm cash liquidity requirements consist primarily of obligations under our longterm debt agreements there is no maturity on any tranche of term loans or notes until july 2024 

as a result of the debt financing transactions completed during the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 as described in note 12 “debt” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein interest payments will increase going forward in accordance with the terms of the related debt agreements however in connection with the continued application of our three core valuedriven operating strategies obtaining profitable new business continually improving our cost structure and providing highly engineered valueadded products to customers we expect our efforts will continue to generate strong margins and provide sufficient cash provided by operating activities to meet our interest obligations and liquidity needs we believe our cash provided by operating activities and available borrowing capacity will enable us to make strategic business combinations pay dividends to our shareholders andor make opportunistic investments in our own stock 

in the future the company may increase its borrowings in connection with acquisitions if cash flow from operating activities becomes insufficient to fund current operations or for other shortterm cash needs or for stock repurchases or dividends our future leverage will also be impacted by the then current conditions of the credit markets 

operating activities  the company generated 1213 million of net cash from operating activities during fiscal 2020 compared to 1015 million during fiscal 2019 the change from prior year is primarily driven by changes in working capital as further described below 

the change in trade accounts receivable during fiscal 2020 was a source of 352 million in cash compared to a use of cash of 82 million in fiscal 2019 the increase in the source of cash of 434 million is primarily attributable to a decline in sales and the related accounts receivable in the second half of fiscal 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic the company continues to actively manage its accounts receivable the related agings and collection efforts 

the change in inventories during fiscal 2020 was a use of cash of 62 million compared to a use of cash of 36 million in fiscal 2019 

the change in accounts payable during fiscal 2020 was a use of cash of 62 million compared to a use of cash of 1 million in fiscal 2019 the increase in the use of cash is primarily driven by a decline in accounts payable as inventory and other purchases have slowed as a result of the covid19 pandemic and cost mitigation measures enacted in the second half of fiscal 2020 

investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was 799 million during fiscal 2020 consisting of proceeds of 904 million from the divestiture of souriausunbank net of cash transferred with the divested entities partially offset by capital expenditures of 105 million the company estimates its capital expenditures in fiscal year 2021 to be between 120 million and 140 million with the increase from prior year attributable to fiscal 2020 projects that were delayed into fiscal 2021 as a result of the covid19 pandemic the company’s capital expenditures incurred from year to year are primarily for projects that are consistent with our three core valuedriven operating strategies obtaining profitable new business continually improve our cost structure and providing highly engineered valueadded products to customers 

financing activities  net cash provided by financing activities during the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 was 1230 million the source of cash was primarily attributable to 2625 million in net proceeds from the completion of the 550 2027 notes offering 1090 million in net proceeds from the completion of the 2025 secured notes offering 399 million in net proceeds from the completion of the 625 2026 new notes offering 200 million drawn from the existing revolving credit facility and 116 million in proceeds from stock option exercises this was partially offset by special dividend and dividend equivalent payments of 1928 million the redemption of the 2022 notes outstanding for 1167 million repayments on term loans of 75 million the purchase of treasury stock of 19 million and other financing costs of 11 million

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  interest rate risk 

our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk is principally our variable rate debt in 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate libor and other interbank offered rates which have been widely used as reference rates for various securities and financial contracts including loans debt and derivatives regulators in the us and other jurisdictions have been working to replace these rates with alternative reference interest rates that are supported by transactions in liquid and observable markets such as the sofr in february 2020 in connection with amendment no 7 to the credit agreement we amended the credit agreement to include a provision for the determination of an alternative reference interest rate the discontinuation of libor will also require our derivative agreements to be amended once the alternative interest rate has replaced libor our future interest expense could be impacted 

at september 30 2020 we had borrowings under our term loans of approximately 7449 million that were subject to interest rate risk borrowings under our term loans bear interest at our option at a rate equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted libor for a one two three or sixmonth or to the extent available to each lender nine or twelvemonth interest period chosen by us in each case plus an applicable margin percentage accordingly the company’s cash flows and earnings will be exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes resulting from variable rate borrowings under our term loans the companys objective is to maintain an allocation of at least 75 fixed rate and 25 variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in nearterm interest rates as of september 30 2020 approximately 84 of our debt was fixed rate debt the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the annual interest costs under our term loans by approximately 75 million based on the amount of outstanding borrowings at september 30 2020 the weighted average interest rate on the 7449 million of borrowings under our term loans on september 30 2020 was 32 

interest rate swaps and caps used to hedge and offset respectively the variable interest rates on the credit facility are described in note 21 “derivatives and hedging activities” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes 

for information about the fair value of the aggregate principal amount of borrowings under our term loans and the fair value of the notes see note 20 “fair value measurements” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

  foreign currency risk 

certain of our foreign subsidiaries’ sales and results of operations are subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which we transact business could materially adversely affect our net sales net income and the carrying values of our assets located outside the us global economic uncertainty continues to exist strengthening of the us dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our operating results 

if the us dollar were to strengthen our foreign results of operations would be unfavorably impacted but the effect is not expected to be material a 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have resulted in a material impact to net income for the fiscal years ended september 30 2020 2019 and 2018

 item 1 business 

the company 

transdigm inc was formed in 1993 in connection with a leveraged buyout transaction td group was formed in 2003 to facilitate a leveraged buyout of transdigm inc the company was owned by private equity funds until its initial public offering in 2006 td group’s common stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange or nyse under the ticker symbol “tdg” 

we believe we are a leading global designer producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers we estimate that approximately 90 of our net sales for fiscal year 2019 were generated by proprietary products in addition for fiscal year 2019  we estimate that we generated approximately 80 of our net sales from products in which we are the sole source provider 

most of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue once our parts are designed into and sold on a new aircraft we generate net sales from aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft which is generally estimated to be approximately 25 to 30 years a typical platform can be produced for 20 to 30 years giving us an estimated product life cycle in excess of 50 years we estimate that approximately 52 of our net sales in fiscal year 2019 were generated from aftermarket sales the vast majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets these aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and been more stable than sales to original equipment manufacturers or oems 

products 

we primarily design produce and supply highly engineered proprietary aerospace components and certain systemssubsystems with significant aftermarket content we seek to develop highly customized products to solve specific needs for aircraft operators and manufacturers we attempt to differentiate ourselves based on engineering service and manufacturing capabilities we typically choose not to compete for nonproprietary “build to print” business because it frequently offers lower margins than proprietary 

products we believe that our products have strong brand names within the industry and that we have a reputation for high quality reliability and strong customer support 

our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products that we offer to our customers some of our more significant product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and engine technology specialized pumps and valves power conditioning devices specialized acdc electric motors and generators nicad batteries and chargers engineered latching and locking devices rods and locking devices engineered connectors and elastomers databus and power controls cockpit security components and systems specialized cockpit displays aircraft audio systems specialized lavatory components seat belts and safety restraints engineered interior surfaces and related components advanced sensor products switches and relay panels advanced displays thermal protection and insulation lighting and control technology military personnel parachutes high performance hoists winches and lifting devices and cargo loading handling and delivery systems 

acquisition of esterline technologies corporation 

on march 14 2019 transdigm completed the acquisition of all the outstanding stock of esterline technologies corporation “esterline” for 12250 per share in cash plus the repayment of esterline debt the purchase price net of cash acquired of approximately 3982 million totaled approximately 39239 million of the 39239 million purchase price 35363 million was paid at closing and the remaining 3876 million was classified as restricted cash for the redemption of esterline’s outstanding senior notes due 2023 herein the 2023 notes the 2023 notes were redeemed on april 15 2019 esterline through its subsidiaries is an industry leader in specialized manufacturing for the aerospace and defense industry primarily within three core disciplines advanced materials avionics and controls and sensors and systems the acquisition of esterline expands transdigms platform of proprietary and sole source content for the aerospace and defense industry and the esterline products have significant aftermarket exposure 

for further details on the acquisitions and divestitures that occurred during fiscal 2019 refer to note 2 “acquisitions and divestitures” to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

segments 

the company’s businesses are organized and managed in three reporting segments power  control airframe and nonaviation 

the power  control segment includes operations that primarily develop produce and market systems and components that predominately provide power to or control power of the aircraft utilizing electronic fluid power and mechanical motion control technologies major product offerings include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and engine technology specialized pumps and valves power conditioning devices specialized acdc electric motors and generators databus and power controls advanced sensor products switches and relay panels high performance hoists winches and lifting devices and cargo loading and handling systems primary customers of this segment are engine and power system and subsystem suppliers airlines third party maintenance suppliers military buying agencies and repair depots products are sold in the original equipment and aftermarket market channels 

the airframe segment includes operations that primarily develop produce and market systems and components that are used in nonpower airframe applications utilizing airframe and cabin structure technologies major product offerings include engineered latching and locking devices rods and locking devices engineered connectors and elastomers cockpit security components and systems aircraft audio systems specialized lavatory components seat belts and safety restraints engineered interior surfaces and related components advanced displays thermal protection lighting and control technology military personnel parachutes and cargo delivery systems primary customers of this segment are airframe manufacturers and cabin system suppliers and subsystem suppliers airlines third party maintenance suppliers military buying agencies and repair depots products are sold in the original equipment and aftermarket market channels 

the nonaviation segment includes operations that primarily develop produce and market products for nonaviation markets major product offerings include seat belts and safety restraints for ground transportation applications mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls for space applications hydraulicelectromechanical actuators and fuel valves for land based gas turbines and refueling systems for heavy equipment used in mining construction and other industries and turbine controls for the energy and oil and gas markets primary customers of this segment are offroad vehicle suppliers and subsystem suppliers child restraint system suppliers satellite and space system suppliers manufacturers of heavy equipment used in mining construction and other industries and turbine original equipment manufacturers gas pipeline builders and electric utilities 

the esterline businesses were acquired towards the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and preliminarily assessed as a separate segment of the company during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 the esterline businesses were integrated into transdigms existing power  control airframe and nonaviation segments 

for financial information about our segments see note 17 “segments” to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

sales and marketing 

consistent with our overall strategy our sales and marketing organization is structured to continually develop technical solutions that meet customer needs in particular we attempt to focus on products and programs that will lead to highmargin repeatable sales in the aftermarket 

we have structured our sales efforts along our major product offerings assigning a business unit manager to certain products each business unit manager is expected to grow the sales and profitability of the products for which he or she is responsible and to achieve the targeted annual level of bookings sales new business and profitability for such products the business unit managers are assisted by account managers and sales engineers who are responsible for covering major oem and aftermarket accounts account managers and sales engineers are expected to be familiar with the personnel organization and needs of specific customers to achieve total bookings and new business goals for each account and together with the business unit managers to determine when additional resources are required at customer locations most of our sales personnel are evaluated in part on their bookings and their ability to identify and obtain new business opportunities 

though typically performed by employees the account manager function may be performed by independent representatives depending on the specific customer product and geographic location we also use a number of distributors to provide logistical support as well as serve as a primary customer contact with certain smaller accounts our major distributors are aviall inc a subsidiary of the boeing company and satair as a subsidiary of airbus sas 

manufacturing and engineering 

we maintain approximately 110 manufacturing facilities most of our manufacturing facilities are comprised of manufacturing distribution and engineering functions and most facilities have certain administrative functions including management sales and finance we continually strive to improve productivity and reduce costs including rationalization of operations developing improved control systems that allow for accurate accounting and reporting investing in equipment tooling information systems and implementing broadbased employee training programs management believes that our manufacturing systems and equipment contribute to our ability to compete by permitting us to meet the rigorous tolerances and cost sensitive price structure of aircraft component customers 

we attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by producing uniquely engineered products with high quality and timely delivery our engineering costs are recorded in cost of sales and in selling and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income research and development costs are recorded in selling and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income the aggregate of engineering expense and research and development expense represents approximately 9 of our operating units’ aggregate costs or approximately 5 of our consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2019 our proprietary products and particularly our new product initiatives are designed by our engineers and are intended to serve the needs of the aircraft component industry these proprietary designs must withstand the extraordinary conditions and stresses that will be endured by products during use and meet the rigorous demands of our customers’ tolerance and quality requirements 

we use sophisticated equipment and procedures to comply with quality requirements specifications and federal aviation administration “faa” and oem requirements we perform a variety of testing procedures as required by our customers such as testing under different temperature humidity and altitude levels flammability testing shock and vibration testing and xray fluorescent measurement these procedures together with other customer approved techniques for document process and quality control are used throughout our manufacturing facilities refer to note 3 “summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements included herein with respect to total costs of research and development 

customers 

we predominantly serve customers in the commercial regional business jet and general aviation aftermarket which accounts for approximately 32 of total sales the commercial aerospace oem market comprising large commercial transport manufacturers and regional and business jet manufacturers which accounts for approximately 26 of total sales and the defense market which accounts for approximately 37 of total sales nonaerospace sales comprise approximately 5 of our total sales 

our customers include 1 distributors of aerospace components 2 worldwide commercial airlines including national and regional airlines 3 large commercial transport and regional and business aircraft oems 4 various armed forces of the united states and friendly foreign governments 5 defense oems 6 system suppliers and 7 various other industrial customers for the fiscal year ended september 30 2019  the boeing company which includes aviall inc a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world accounted for approximately 11 of our net sales our top ten customers for fiscal year 2019 accounted for approximately 42 of our net sales products supplied to many of our customers are used on multiple platforms 

the markets in which we sell our products are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced upswings and downturns the demand for our commercial aftermarket parts and services depends on among other things the breadth of our installed oem base revenue passenger miles “rpms” the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet the percentage of the worldwide fleet 

that is in warranty and airline profitability the demand for defense products is specifically dependent on government budget trends military campaigns and political pressures 

competition 

the niche markets within the aerospace industry that we serve are relatively fragmented and we face several competitors for many of the products and services we provide due to the global nature of the commercial aircraft industry competition in these categories comes from both us and foreign companies competitors in our product offerings range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privatelyheld entities with only one or two components in their entire product portfolios 

we compete on the basis of engineering manufacturing and marketing high quality products which we believe meet or exceed the performance and maintenance requirements of our customers consistent and timely delivery and superior customer service and support the industry’s stringent regulatory certification and technical requirements and the investments necessary in the development and certification of products may create disincentives for potential new competitors for certain products if customers receive products that meet or exceed expectations and performance standards we believe that they will have a reduced incentive to certify another supplier because of the cost and time of the technical design and testing certification process in addition we believe that the availability dependability and safety of our products are reasons for our customers to continue longterm supplier relationships 

government contracts 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 1 suspend us from receiving new contracts 2 terminate existing contracts 3 reduce the value of existing contracts 4 audit our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs 5 control and potentially prohibit the export of our products and 6 seek repayment of contract related payments under certain circumstances violations of government procurement laws could result in civil or criminal penalties 

governmental regulation 

the commercial aircraft component industry is highly regulated by the faa in the united states and by the joint aviation authorities in europe and other agencies throughout the world while the military aircraft component industry is governed by military quality specifications we and the components we manufacture are required to be certified by one or more of these entities or agencies and in many cases by individual oems in order to engineer and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models 

we must also satisfy the requirements of our customers including oems and airlines that are subject to faa regulations and provide these customers with products and services that comply with the government regulations applicable to commercial flight operations in addition the faa requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components we believe that we currently satisfy or exceed these maintenance standards in our repair and overhaul services we also maintain several faa approved repair stations 

in addition our businesses are subject to many other laws and requirements typically applicable to manufacturers and exporters without limiting the foregoing sales of many of our products that will be used on aircraft owned by foreign entities are subject to compliance with export control laws and the manufacture of our products and the operations of our businesses including the disposal of hazardous wastes are subject to compliance with applicable environmental laws 

market channels 

the commercial aerospace industry including the aftermarket and oem market is impacted by the health of the global economy and geopolitical events around the world the commercial aerospace industry has shown strength with increases in revenue passenger miles or rpms since 2010 and positive growth continued through 2019 with increase in rpms  as well as general growth in the large commercial oem sector aircraft with 100 or more seats with order announcements by the boeing company and airbus sas leading to planned increases in production the primary exception to this was the production rate decrease on the boeing 737 max although not material to transdigm’s financial results the 2020 leading indicators or industry consensus suggest a continuation of current trends in the commercial transport market sector supported by continued rpm growth and increases in production at the oem level  

the defense aerospace market is dependent on government budget constraints the timing of orders political pressures and the extent of global conflicts it is not necessarily affected by general economic conditions that affect the commercial aerospace industry 

our presence in both the commercial aerospace and military sectors of the aerospace industry may mitigate the impact on our business of any specific industry risk we service a diversified customer base in the commercial and military aerospace industry and we provide components to a diverse installed base of aircraft which mitigates our exposure to any individual airframe platform at times declines in sales in one channel have been offset by increased sales in another channel however due to differences 

between the profitability of our products sold to oem and aftermarket customers variation in product mix can cause variation in gross margin 

there are many shortterm factors including inventory corrections unannounced changes in order patterns strikes facility shutdowns caused by fires hurricanes or other incidents and mergers and acquisitions that can cause shortterm disruptions in our quarterly shipment patterns as compared to previous quarters and the same periods in prior years as such it can be difficult to determine longerterm trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons to normalize for shortterm fluctuations we tend to look at our performance over several quarters or years of activity rather than discrete shortterm periods 

there are also fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering and delivery requests from quartertoquarter as well as variations in product mix from quartertoquarter that may cause positive or negative variations in gross profit margins since commercial aftermarket sales have historically produced a higher gross margin than sales to commercial oems again in many instances these are timing events between quarters and must be balanced with macro aerospace industry indicators 

commercial aftermarket 

the key growth factors in the commercial aftermarket include worldwide rpms and the size and activity level of the worldwide fleet of aircraft and the percentage of the fleet that is in warranty 

commercial oem market 

the commercial transport market sector the largest sector in the commercial oem market declined in 2019 primarily due to the 737 max production rate cuts at the boeing company however the rate cuts did not have a material impact on our commercial oem revenue as our revenue growth outperformed the general market our commercial transport oem shipments and revenues generally run ahead of the boeing company and airbus sas airframe delivery schedules as a result and consistent with prior years our fiscal 2020 shipments will be a function of among other things the estimated 2020 and 2021 commercial airframe production rates we have been experiencing increased sales in the large commercial oem sector aircraft with 100 or more seats driven by an increase in production by the boeing company and airbus sas tied to previous order announcements industry consensus indicates this production increase will continue in 2020 but may begin to moderate or modestly decline in 2021 

defense 

our military business fluctuates from year to year and is dependent to a degree on government budget constraints the timing of orders macro and micro dynamics with respect to department of defense procurement policy and the extent of global conflicts for a variety of reasons the military spending outlook is very uncertain for planning purposes we assume that militaryrelated sales of our types of products to be flat in future years over the recent high levels 

raw materials 

we require the use of various raw materials in our manufacturing processes we also purchase a variety of manufactured component parts from various suppliers we also purchase replacement parts which are utilized in our various repair and overhaul operations at times we concentrate our orders among a few suppliers in order to strengthen our supplier relationships most of our raw materials and component parts are generally available from multiple suppliers at competitive prices 

intellectual property 

we have various trade secrets proprietary information trademarks trade names patents copyrights and other intellectual property rights which we believe in the aggregate but not individually are important to our business 

backlog 

as of september 30 2019  the company estimated its sales order backlog at 3437 million compared to an estimated sales order backlog of 2026 million as of september 30 2018  the increase in backlog is due to growth from recent acquisitions particularly the esterline acquisition and organic growth in the commercial aftermarket commercial oem and defense markets the majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of september 30 2019 are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months purchase orders may be subject to cancellation or deferral by the customer prior to shipment the level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of the company’s receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled accordingly the company’s backlog as of september 30 2019 may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period 

foreign operations 

although we manufacture a significant portion of our products in the united states we manufacture some products in belgium canada china the dominican republic france germany hong kong hungary india japan malaysia mexico morocco norway singapore sri lanka sweden and the united kingdom although the majority of sales of our products are made to customers including distributors located in the united states our products are ultimately sold to and used by customers including airlines and other end users of aircraft throughout the world a number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including currency fluctuations difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies restrictions on the repatriation of funds change in trade policies tariff regulation difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition 

environmental matters 

our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things discharges of pollutants into the air and water the generation handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees environmental laws and regulations may require that the company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations certain facilities and thirdparty sites utilized by the company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws the company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws for information regarding environmental accruals see note 15 “environmental liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

employees 

as of september 30 2019  we had approximately 18300 fulltime parttime and temporary employees from business units in continuing operations approximately 18 of our fulltime and parttime employees were represented by labor unions collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire at various dates ranging from november 2019 to may 2023 we consider our relationship with our employees generally to be satisfactory

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below are important risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business and financial condition and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

our commercial business is sensitive to the number of flight hours that our customers’ planes spend aloft the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and our customers’ profitability these items are in turn affected by general economic and geopolitical and other worldwide conditions 

our commercial business is directly affected by among other factors changes in revenue passenger miles rpms the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet the percentage of the fleet that is outofwarranty and changes in the profitability of the commercial airline industry rpms and airline profitability have historically been correlated with the general economic environment although national and international events also play a key role for example in the past the airline industry has been severely affected by the downturn in the global economy higher fuel prices the increased security concerns among airline customers following the events of september 11 2001 the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic and the conflicts abroad and could be impacted by future geopolitical or other worldwide events such as war terrorist acts or a worldwide infectious disease outbreak in addition global market and economic conditions have been challenging with turbulence in the us and international markets and economies and have prolonged declines in business and consumer spending as a result of the substantial reduction in airline traffic resulting from these events the airline industry incurred large losses and financial difficulties some carriers have also parked or retired a portion of their fleets and have reduced workforces and flights during periods of reduced airline profitability some airlines may delay purchases of spare parts preferring instead to deplete existing inventories and delay refurbishments and discretionary spending if demand for spare parts decreases there would be a decrease in demand for certain of our products an adverse change in demand could impact our results of operations collection of accounts receivable and our 

expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses which may adversely impact our financial condition and access to capital markets 

our sales to manufacturers of aircraft are cyclical and a downturn in sales to these manufacturers may adversely affect us 

our sales to manufacturers of large commercial aircraft such as the boeing company airbus sas and related oem suppliers as well as manufacturers of business jets which collectively accounted for approximately 26 of our net sales in fiscal year 2019  have historically experienced periodic downturns in the past these sales have been affected by airline profitability which is impacted by among other things fuel and labor costs price competition interest rates downturns in the global economy and national and international events in addition sales of our products to manufacturers of business jets are impacted by among other things downturns in the global economy downturns adversely affect our net sales gross margin and net income 

we rely heavily on certain customers for much of our sales 

our largest customer for fiscal year 2019 was the boeing company which includes aviall inc the boeing company accounted for approximately 11 of our net sales in fiscal year 2019  our top ten customers for fiscal year 2019 accounted for approximately 42 of our net sales a material reduction in purchasing by one of our larger customers for any reason including but not limited to economic downturn decreased production strike or resourcing could have a material adverse effect on our net sales gross margin and net income in 2019 the boeing company announced a production rate decrease on the boeing 737 max from 52 to 42 airplanes per month the company does not anticipate the current production rate decrease to have a material impact on the company’s financial results 

we generally do not have guaranteed future sales of our products further when we enter into fixed price contracts with some of our customers we take the risk for cost overruns 

as is customary in our business we do not generally have longterm contracts with most of our aftermarket customers and therefore do not have guaranteed future sales although we have longterm contracts with many of our oem customers many of those customers may terminate the contracts on short notice and in most cases our customers have not committed to buy any minimum quantity of our products in addition in certain cases we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon the historic purchasing patterns of customers and upon our discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements and this anticipated future volume of orders may not materialize 

we also have entered into multiyear fixedprice contracts with some of our customers pursuant to which we have agreed to perform the work for a fixed price and accordingly realize all the benefit or detriment resulting from any decreases or increases in the costs of making these products sometimes we accept a fixedprice contract for a product that we have not yet produced and this increases the risk of cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product most of our contracts do not permit us to recover increases in raw material prices taxes or labor costs 

us military spending is dependent upon the us defense budget 

the military and defense market is significantly dependent upon government budget trends particularly the us department of defense the “dod” budget in addition to normal business risks our supply of products to the united states government is subject to unique risks largely beyond our control dod budgets could be negatively impacted by several factors including but not limited to a change in defense spending policy by the current presidential administration the us government’s budget deficits spending priorities the cost of sustaining the us military presence internationally and possible political pressure to reduce us government military spending each of which could cause the dod budget to remain unchanged or to decline a significant decline in us military expenditures could result in a reduction in the amount of our products sold to the various agencies and buying organizations of the us government 

we intend to pursue acquisitions our business may be adversely affected if we cannot consummate acquisitions on satisfactory terms or if we cannot effectively integrate acquired operations 

a significant portion of our growth has occurred through acquisitions any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions we intend to pursue acquisitions that we believe will present opportunities consistent with our overall business strategy however we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates to purchase or may be unable to acquire desired businesses or assets on economically acceptable terms or may be unable to receive necessary regulatory approvals or support in addition we may not be able to raise the capital necessary to fund future acquisitions because we may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously we may encounter unforeseen expenses complications and delays including regulatory complications or difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight 

we regularly engage in discussions with respect to potential acquisition and investment opportunities if we consummate an acquisition our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly future acquisitions could result in margin dilution and further likely result in the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest and amortization 

expenses or periodic impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets as well as significant charges relating to integration costs 

acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect in addition we may not be able to successfully integrate any business we acquire into our existing business the successful integration of new businesses depends on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs the successful integration of future acquisitions may also require substantial attention from our senior management and the management of the acquired business which could decrease the time that they have to service attract customers and develop new products and services or attend to other acquisition opportunities 

we are subject to many of the foregoing risks in connection with our acquisition of esterline completed in march 2019 and these risks may be exacerbated due to the scale and complexity of that acquisition as compared to our recent acquisitions the acquisition has required and will continue to require extensive integration efforts these efforts could result in significant unforeseen costs and require substantial attention from our senior management if we are unable to successfully integrate esterline or the acquisition otherwise does not perform to our expectations our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected it is also possible that the substantial management attention required by and the indebtedness incurred in connection with the transaction could cause us to forgo other acquisition opportunities particularly if we encounter unexpected costs or the acquisition otherwise does not perform to our expectations 

we are subject to certain unique business risks as a result of supplying equipment and services to the us government 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies whether through direct contracts with the us government or a as a subcontractor to customers contracting with the us government are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 

 most of our us government contracts can be terminated by the us government at its convenience without significant notice termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination 

on contracts for which the price is based on cost the us government may review our costs and performance as well as our accounting and general business practices based on the results of such audits the us government may adjust our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs in addition under us government purchasing regulations some of our costs including most financing costs amortization of intangible assets portions of research and development costs and certain marketing expenses may not be subject to reimbursement 

furthermore even where the price is not based on cost the us government may seek to review our costs to determine whether our pricing is “fair and reasonable” our subsidiaries are periodically subject to pricing reviews and government buying agencies that purchase some of our subsidiaries’ products are periodically subject to audits by the dod office of inspector general “oig” with respect to prices paid for such products in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 we voluntarily refunded 16 million to the us government following an oig audit and another oig audit is underway in addition our defenserelated business is the subject of an ongoing congressional inquiry by the house oversight committee pricing reviews and government audits including the audit underway and the congressional inquiry are costly and time consuming for our management and could distract from our ability to effectively manage the business as a result of these reviews audits and inquiries we could be subject to providing further refunds to the us government or we could be asked to enter into an arrangement whereby our prices would be based on cost the dod could seek to pursue alternative sources of supply for our parts or the us government could take other adverse actions with respect to our contracts any of those occurrences could lead to a reduction in our revenue from or the profitability of certain of our supply arrangements with certain agencies and buying organizations of the us government 

if a government inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions including contract termination fines forfeiture of fees suspension of payment and suspension or debarment from doing business with us government agencies any of which could materially adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

moreover us government purchasing regulations contain a number of additional operational requirements which do not apply to entities not engaged in government contracting failure to comply with such government contracting requirements could result in civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

our business may be adversely affected if we would lose our government or industry approvals or if more stringent government regulations are enacted or if industry oversight is increased 

the aerospace industry is highly regulated in the united states and in other countries in order to sell our components we and the components we manufacture must be certified by the faa the dod and similar agencies in foreign countries and by individual manufacturers if new and more stringent government regulations are adopted or if industry oversight increases we might incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or heightened industry oversight in addition if material authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended our business would be adversely affected 

in addition to the aviation approvals we are at times required to obtain approval from us government agencies to export our products us laws and regulations applicable to us include the arms export control act the international traffic in arms regulations itar the export administration regulations ear and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the united states department of the treasurys office of foreign assets control ofac ear restricts the export of dualuse products and technical data to certain countries while itar restricts the export of defense products technical data and defense services 

failure to obtain approval to export or determination by the us government that we failed to receive required approvals or licenses could eliminate or restrict our ability to sell our products outside the united states and the penalties that could be imposed by the us government for failure to comply with these laws could be significant 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and could harm our ability to react to changes to our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of september 30 2019  our total indebtedness excluding approximately 415 million of letters of credit outstanding was approximately 169 billion  which was 1207 of our total book capitalization as a result of special dividends being funded in part with indebtedness and the addition of approximately 40 billion in net new incremental borrowings during fiscal 2019 in connection with the financing of the esterline acquisition 

in addition we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future for example on october 29 2019 the company entered into a purchase agreement in connection with a private offering of 265 billion aggregate principal amount in 550 senior subordinated notes due november 15 2027 the settlement of the debt financing transaction occurred on november 13 2019 the notes were issued at a price of 100 of their principal amount the company will use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering of the notes to redeem all of its outstanding aggregate principal amount of 115 billion 6000 senior subordinated notes due 2022 also as of september 30 2019  we had approximately 7185 million of unused commitments under our revolving loan facility although our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the various senior subordinated notes outstanding the “indentures” contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these qualifications and exceptions could be substantial for example if the usage of the revolving loan facility exceeds 35 of the total revolving commitments the company will be required to maintain a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio of net debt as defined to trailing fourquarter ebitda as defined a breach of any of the covenants or an inability to comply with the required leverage ratio could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the indentures 

an increase in our substantial indebtedness could also have other important consequences to investors for example it could 

 all of our debt under the senior secured credit facility which includes 75 billion in term loans and a revolving loan facility of 760 million  bears interest at variable rates primarily based on the london interbank offered rate libor for deposits of us dollars accordingly if libor or other variable interest rates increase our debt service expense will also increase interest rate swap and cap agreements are used to manage interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings under our credit facilities for information about our interest rate swap and cap agreements see note 21 “derivatives and hedging instruments” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

in addition on july 27 2017 the financial conduct authority fca in the uk announced that it would phase out libor as a benchmark by the end of calendar year 2021 the expected discontinuation of libor may require us to amend certain agreements governing our debt and although the us and other jurisdictions are working to replace libor with alternative reference rates we cannot predict what alternative index margin adjustments and related terms would be negotiated with our counterparties as a result our interest expense could increase 

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness including the indentures we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital 

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness including the indentures amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility amounts due under our securitization facility and to fund our operations will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future which to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness including the amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility amounts borrowed under our securitization facility and the indentures or to fund our other liquidity needs if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital we cannot assure that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations the terms of existing or future debt instruments the securitization facility the indentures and the senior secured credit facility may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives in addition any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms and would otherwise adversely affect the indentures 

the terms of the senior secured credit facility and indentures may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

our senior secured credit facility and the indentures contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indentures and may limit their ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests the senior secured credit facility and indentures include covenants restricting among other things the ability of td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indentures to 



a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the indentures if any such default occurs the lenders under the senior secured credit facility and the holders of the senior subordinated notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder to be immediately due and payable the lenders under the senior secured credit facility also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings in addition following an event of default under the senior secured credit facility the lenders under that facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which includes our available cash and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the senior subordinated notes if the debt under the senior secured credit facility or the senior subordinated notes were to be accelerated we cannot assure that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations 

our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things discharges of pollutants into the air and water the generation handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees environmental laws and regulations may require that the company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations certain facilities and thirdparty sites utilized by subsidiaries of the company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws the company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws 

estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are based on current facts laws regulations and technology these estimates take into consideration the company’s prior experience and professional judgment of the company’s environmental advisors estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination the range of remediation alternatives available evolving remediation standards imprecise engineering evaluations and cost estimates the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 

accordingly as investigation and remediation proceed it is likely that adjustments in the company’s accruals will be necessary to reflect new information the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in a given period based on currently available information however the company does not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition 

we are dependent on our senior management team and highly trained employees and any work stoppage or difficulty hiring similar employees could adversely affect our business 

because our products are complicated and highly engineered we depend on an educated and trained workforce there is substantial competition for skilled personnel in the aircraft component industry and we could be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled employees we may not be able to fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover or attract and retain qualified personnel 

although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory we cannot assure that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory renewal of collective bargaining agreements or that our employee relations will remain stable because we maintain a relatively small inventory of finished goods any work stoppage could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide products to our customers 

in addition our success depends in part on our ability to attract and motivate our senior management and key employees achieving this objective may be difficult due to a variety of factors including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions competitors’ hiring practices and the effectiveness of our compensation programs competition for qualified personnel can be intense a loss of senior management and key personnel or failure to attract qualified new talent could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and our operating results andor market value could be adversely affected the board continually monitors this risk and we believe that the board’s succession plan together with our straightforward strategy clear value drivers decentralized nature and the quality of managers running our operating units helps to mitigate this risk 

we may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings including fair labor standards act and state wage and hour class action lawsuits which may adversely affect our business and financial performance 

from time to time we are involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of business these actions and proceedings may involve claims for among other things compensation for alleged personal injury workers’ compensation employment discrimination or breach of contract in addition we may be subject to class action lawsuits including those involving allegations of violations of consumer product statutes or the fair labor standards act and state wage and hour laws due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions or proceedings the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions is difficult to assess or quantify as plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts in these types of lawsuits and the magnitude of the potential 

loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition plaintiffs in many types of actions may seek punitive damages civil penalties consequential damages or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief these proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves the ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement mediation or court judgment could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business is dependent on the availability of certain components and raw materials from suppliers 

our business is affected by the price and availability of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our components our business therefore could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our suppliers such as the destruction of our suppliers’ facilities or their distribution infrastructure a work stoppage or strike by our suppliers’ employees or the failure of our suppliers to provide materials of the requisite quality or by increased costs of such raw materials or components if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers because we maintain a relatively small inventory of raw materials and component parts our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers or alternative raw materials or component parts the lengthy and expensive faa and oem certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier raw material or component part 

our operations depend on our manufacturing facilities which are subject to physical and other risks that could disrupt production 

a number of our manufacturing facilities are located in the greater los angeles area an area known for earthquakes and fires and are thus vulnerable to damage in addition a number of our manufacturing facilities are located along the eastern seaboard area susceptible to hurricanes we are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters including power loss fire explosions floods communications failures terrorist attacks and similar events disruptions could also occur due to cyberattacks computer or equipment malfunction accidental or intentional operator error or process failures should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms such as our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans be insufficient to recover all costs we could experience a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

operations and sales outside of the united states may be subject to additional risks 

a number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including currency fluctuations difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies restrictions on the repatriation of funds change in trade policies tariff regulation difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition furthermore the company is subject to laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act uk bribery act and similar local antibribery laws which generally prohibit companies and their employees agents and contractors from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure to comply with these laws could subject the company to civil and criminal penalties that could materially adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

we face significant competition 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry and compete against a number of companies competitors in our product lines are both us and foreign companies and range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privately held entities we believe that our ability to compete depends on high product performance consistent high quality short leadtime and timely delivery competitive pricing superior customer service and support and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs we may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive 

we could be adversely affected if one of our components causes an aircraft to crash 

our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we have designed manufactured or serviced while we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future product liability claims in the event of product liability claims our insurers may attempt to deny coverage or any coverage we have may not be adequate we also may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost any liability not covered by insurance or for which third party indemnification is not available could result in significant liability to us 

in addition a crash caused by one of our components could damage our reputation for quality products we believe our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting a provider of aircraft components if a crash were to be caused by one of our components or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of data protection concerns 

the interpretation and application of data protection laws in the us europe including but not limited to the general data protection regulation the “gdpr” and the california consumer privacy act the “ccpa” and elsewhere are uncertain and evolving it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices complying with these various laws is difficult and could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business further although we have implemented internal controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the gdpr ccpa and other privacyrelated laws rules and regulations collectively the “data protection laws” there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures will enable us to be fully compliant with all data protection laws 

despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data comply with applicable laws rules and regulations and implement data security measures our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches and other data loss including cyberattacks and in fact we have experienced data security incidents that have not had a material impact on our financial results in addition it is not possible to predict the impact on our business of the future loss alteration or misappropriation of information in our possession related to us our employees former employees customers suppliers or others this could lead to negative publicity legal claims theft modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information damage to or inaccessibility of critical systems manufacture of defective products production downtimes operational disruptions and other significant costs which could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and results of operations 

we have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets which may never generate the returns we expect 

mergers and acquisitions have resulted in significant increases in identifiable intangible assets and goodwill identifiable intangible assets which primarily include trademarks trade names customer relationships and technology were approximately 27 billion at september 30 2019  representing approximately 17 of our total assets goodwill recognized in accounting for the mergers and acquisitions was approximately 78 billion at september 30 2019  representing approximately 48 of our total assets we may never realize the full value of our identifiable intangible assets and goodwill and to the extent we were to determine that our identifiable intangible assets or our goodwill were impaired within the meaning of applicable accounting standards we would be required to writeoff the amount of any impairment 

volatility in the equity markets or interest rates could substantially increase our pension costs and required pension contributions 

the company sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans and a nonqualified postretirement plan certain qualified defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of debt and equity securities and other investments among other factors changes in interest rates investment returns and the market value of plan assets can i affect the level of plan funding ii cause volatility in the net periodic pension cost and iii increase our future contribution requirements a significant decrease in investment returns or the market value of plan assets or a significant decrease in interest rates could increase our net periodic pension costs and adversely affect our results of operations a significant increase in our contribution requirements with respect to our qualified defined benefit pension plans could have an adverse impact on our cash flow 

we may be subject to risks relating to changes in its tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various nonus jurisdictions the company’s domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions the company’s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the company’s effective tax rate as a result of changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets challenges by tax authorities or changes in tax laws or regulations in addition the amount of income taxes paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company’s tax liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

our stock price may be volatile and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 

there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities which is unrelated to the operating performance of the companies issuing the securities these market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock shareholders may not be able to sell their shares at or above the purchase price due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock such changes could be caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects including possible changes due to the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry and other factors such as fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering which could cause shortterm swings in profit margins or such changes could be unrelated to our operating performance such as changes in market conditions affecting the stock market generally or the stocks of aerospace companies or changes in the outlook for our common stock such as changes to or the confidence in our business strategy changes to or confidence in our management or expectations for future growth of the company 

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our share price 

we may sell additional shares of common stock into the public markets or issue convertible debt securities to raise capital in the future the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public markets or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities to raise capital at a time and price that we deem appropriate 

our corporate documents and delaware law contain certain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable for example our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 149600000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock without stockholder approval the board of directors has the authority to attach special rights including voting and dividend rights to this preferred stock with these rights holders of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75 of the voting power of our issued and outstanding capital stock voting together as a single class is required for the alteration amendment or repeal of certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and certain provisions of our amended and restated bylaws including the provisions relating to our stockholders’ ability to call special meetings notice provisions for stockholder business to be conducted at an annual meeting requests for stockholder lists and corporate records nomination and removal of directors and filling of vacancies on our board of directors 

we are also subject to the antitakeover provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law under these provisions if anyone becomes an “interested stockholder” we may not enter into a “business combination” with that person for three years without special approval which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change of control for purposes of section 203 “interested stockholder” means generally someone owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years subject to certain exceptions as described in section 203 

we do not regularly declare and pay quarterly or annual cash dividends on our stock 

notwithstanding special cash dividends of which the most recent declaration by the company’s board of directors occurred on august 6 2019 in the amount of 3000 per outstanding share of common stock and and cash dividend equivalent payments on options granted under its stock incentive plans we do not anticipate declaring regular quarterly or annual cash dividends on our common stock or any other equity security in the foreseeable future 

the amounts that may be available to us to pay future special cash dividends are restricted under our debt and other agreements any payment of special cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations earnings capital requirements financial condition future prospects contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors therefore shareholders should not rely on regular quarterly or annual dividend income from shares of our common stock and should not rely on special dividends with any regularity or at all

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we and certain of our current or former officers and directors are defendants in a consolidated securities class action captioned in re transdigm group inc securities litigation  case no 117cv01677dcn nd ohio the cases were originally filed on august 10 2017 and september 18 2017 and were consolidated on december 5 2017 the plaintiffs allege that the defendants made false or misleading statements with respect to or failed to disclose the impact of certain alleged business practices in connection with sales to the us government on the company’s growth and profitability the plaintiffs assert claims under section 10b of the exchange act and rule 10b5 promulgated thereunder and section 20a of the exchange act and seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief in addition we as nominal defendant and certain of our current or former officers and directors are defendants in a shareholder derivative action captioned sciabacucchi v howley et al  no 117cv1971dcn nd ohio the case was filed on september 19 2017 the plaintiffs allege breach of fiduciary duty and other claims arising out of substantially the same actions or inactions alleged in the securities class actions described above this action has been stayed pending the outcome of a motion to dismiss on the securities class action although we are only a nominal defendant in the derivative action we could have indemnification obligations andor be required to advance the costs and expenses of the officer and director defendants in the action 

we intend to vigorously defend these matters and believe they are without merit we also believe we have sufficient insurance coverage available for these matters therefore we do not expect these matters to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations however given the preliminary status of the litigation it is difficult to predict the likelihood of an adverse outcome or estimate a range of any potential loss

 item 7 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected financial data” and td group’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report the following discussion may contain predictions estimates and other forwardlooking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties including those discussed under the heading entitled “risk factors” included elsewhere in this report these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 

overview 

for fiscal year 2019  we generated net sales of 52232 million  gross profit of 28093 million or 538 of sales and net income of 8898 million  we believe we have achieved steady longterm growth in sales and improvements in operating performance since our formation in 1993 due to our competitive strengths and through execution of our valuedriven operating strategy more specifically focusing our businesses on our valuedriven operating strategy of obtaining profitable new business carefully controlling the cost structure and pricing our highly engineered valueadded products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so has historically resulted in improvements in gross profit and income from operations over the long term 

our selective acquisition strategy has also contributed to the growth of our business the integration of certain acquisitions into our existing businesses combined with implementing our proven operating strategy has historically resulted in improvements of the financial performance of the acquired business 

we believe our key competitive strengths include 

large and growing installed product base with aftermarket revenue stream we provide components to a large and growing installed base of aircraft to which we supply aftermarket products we estimate that our products are installed on over 100000 commercial transport regional transport military and general aviation fixed wing turbine aircraft and rotary wing aircraft 

diversified revenue base we believe that our diversified revenue base reduces our dependence on any particular product platform or market channel and has been a significant factor in maintaining our financial performance our products are installed on almost all of the major commercial aircraft platforms now in production we expect to continue to develop new products for military and commercial applications 

barriers to entry  we believe that the niche nature of our markets the industry’s stringent regulatory and certification requirements the large number of products that we sell and the investments necessary to develop and certify products create potential disincentives to competition for certain products 

our business strategy is made up of two key elements 1 a valuedriven operating strategy focused around our three core value drivers and 2 a selective acquisition strategy 

valuedriven operating strategy our three core value drivers are 

 selective acquisition strategy we selectively pursue the acquisition of proprietary aerospace component businesses when we see an opportunity to create value through the application of our three core valuedriven operating strategies the aerospace industry in particular remains highly fragmented with many of the companies in the industry being small private businesses or small noncore operations of larger businesses we have significant experience among our management team in executing acquisitions and integrating acquired businesses into our company and culture as of the date of this report we have successfully acquired approximately 85 businesses andor product lines since our formation in 1993 many of these acquisitions have been integrated into an existing transdigm production facility which enables a higher production capacity utilization which in turn improves gross profit levels due to the ability to spread the fixed manufacturing overhead costs over higher production volume in fiscal 2019 we completed our largest acquisition to date when we acquired esterline esterline through its subsidiaries is an industry 

leader in specialized manufacturing for the aerospace and defense industry including significant aftermarket exposure primarily within three core disciplines advanced materials avionics and controls and sensors and systems 

acquisitions and divestitures during the most recent three fiscal years are more fully described in note 2 “acquisitions and divestitures” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations however investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 

below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions for additional accounting policies see note 3 “summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

revenue recognition  in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” 201409 which created a new topic in the accounting standards codification “asc” 606 “revenue from contracts with customers” in addition to superseding and replacing nearly all existing us gaap revenue recognition guidance including industryspecific guidance asc 606 requires an entity to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the standard also specifies the accounting of some costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and expands the disclosure requirements around contracts with customers the company adopted this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the modified retrospective method the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows the results for periods before fiscal 2019 were not restated for the new standard and the cumulative effect of the change in accounting was recognized through retained earnings at the date of adoption refer to note 5 revenue recognition for additional disclosures relating to asc 606 

revenue is recognized from the sale of products when control transfers to the customer which is demonstrated by our right to payment a transfer of title a transfer of the risk and rewards of ownership or the customer acceptance but most frequently upon shipment where the customer obtains physical possession of the goods the majority of the companys revenue is recorded at a point in time sales recognized over time are generally accounted for using an input measure to determine progress completed at the end of the period sales for service contracts generally are recognized as the services are provided for agreements with multiple performance obligations judgment is required to determine whether performance obligations specified in these agreements are distinct and should be accounted for as separate revenue transactions for recognition purposes 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost of inventories is generally determined by the average cost and the firstin firstout fifo methods and includes material labor and overhead related to the manufacturing process because the company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be inservice for 25 or more years it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use where management estimated that the net realizable value was below cost or determined that future demand was lower than current inventory levels based on historical experience current and projected market demand current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value was made by recording a provision included in cost of sales although management believes that the company’s estimates of excess and obsolete inventory are reasonable actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future in addition in accordance with industry practice all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year historically changes in estimates in the net realizable value of inventories have not been significant 

goodwill and other intangible assets  in accordance with asc 805 “business combinations” the company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized as goodwill the valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows revenue growth rates discount rates customer attrition rates royalty rates asset lives and market multiples among other items we determine the fair values of intangible assets acquired generally in consultation with thirdparty valuation advisors fair value adjustments to the company’s assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition  

intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights or if the intangible asset can be sold transferred licensed or exchanged regardless of the company’s intent to do so goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition and are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates 

gaap requires that the annual and any interim impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level the reporting unit level is one level below an operating segment substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each reporting unit pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction with respect to acquisitions integrated into an existing reporting unit any acquired goodwill is combined with the goodwill of the reporting unit 

at the time of goodwill impairment testing the company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test the quantitative test is required only if the company concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount or if the company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit for the quantitative test management determines the estimated fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit if the calculated estimated fair value is less than the current carrying value impairment of goodwill of the reporting unit may exist the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing includes discount rates growth rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates are set by using the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” methodology the wacc methodology considers market and industry data as well as company specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business 

management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates as an indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately through the use of the discounted cash flow valuation model the aggregate of all reporting unit’s estimated fair value is reconciled to the total market capitalization of the company 

the company had 54 reporting units with goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 the date of the last annual impairment test the estimated fair values of each of the reporting units was substantially in excess of their respective carrying values and therefore no goodwill impairment was recorded the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate which is a significant assumption in the calculation of fair values with a one percentage point increase in the discount rate all of the reporting units would continue to have fair values in excess of their respective carrying values 

management tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at the asset level as determined by appropriate asset valuation at the time of acquisition the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets consists of a comparison between the estimated fair values and carrying values if the carrying amounts of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives exceed their estimated fair values an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference management utilizes the royalty savings valuation method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset in this method management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset the key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates royalty rates growth rates sales projections and terminal value rates discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the wacc methodology considering any differences in companyspecific risk factors between reporting units and the indefinitelived intangible assets royalty rates are established by management with the advice of valuation experts and periodically substantiated by valuation experts management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant intangible asset terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates 

the discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed actual results could differ from these assumptions management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering the current economic conditions 

stockbased compensation  the cost of the company’s stockbased compensation is recorded in accordance with asc 718 “stock compensation” the company uses a blackscholes pricing model to estimate the grantdate fair value of the stock options awarded the blackscholes pricing model requires assumptions regarding the expected volatility of the company’s common shares the riskfree interest rate the expected life of the stock options award and the company’s dividend yield the company utilizes historical data in determining these assumptions an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside of management’s control could have an impact on the blackscholes pricing model 

income taxes  the company estimates income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates this involves estimating taxable earnings specific taxable and deductible items the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits to the extent these estimates change adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes are made in the period in which the changes occur historically such adjustments have not been significant 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain operating data of the company including presentation of the amounts as a percentage of net sales amounts in thousands 



fiscal year ended september 30 2019 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2018 

total company 

 

the increase in organic sales for the fiscal year ended september 30 2019 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2018  is primarily related to an increase in defense sales  1808 million  an increase of 136  commercial oem sales  1151 million  an increase of 119  and commercial aftermarket sales  1055 million  an increase of 79  

acquisition sales represent sales of acquired businesses for the period up to one year subsequent to their respective acquisition dates the amount of acquisition sales displayed in the table above for the fiscal year ended september 30 2019 are attributable to the acquisitions of esterline march 2019 skandia july 2018 extant april 2018 and kirkhill march 2018 

 

the net increase in the dollar amount of cost of sales during the fiscal year ended september 30 2019 was primarily due to increased sales volume both organic and from recent acquisitions an increase in inventory acquisition accounting adjustments resulting from the esterline acquisition and an increase in stock compensation expense the increases were partially offset by a decrease in acquisition integration costs and higher foreign currency gains as presented in the table above 

gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased by 33 percentage points to 538 for the fiscal year ended september 30 2019 from 571 for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  the dollar amount of gross profit increased by 6318 million  or 290  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended september 30 2018 due to the following items 

 

the increase in the dollar amount of selling and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended september 30 2019 is primarily due to higher acquisitionrelated expenses of 712 million  higher stock compensation expense of 314 million and higher selling and administrative expenses resulting from primarily the acquisition of esterline in march 2019 also contributing to the increase in selling and administrative expenses was a 161 million payment of a voluntary refund to several us department of defense agencies that occurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2019

for information about our backlog see item 1 “business” 

foreign operations 

our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately 17784 million  13551 million  and 13189 million for the fiscal years 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks including foreign currency fluctuations the impact of foreign government regulations political uncertainties and differences in business practices there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments’ countries furthermore there can be no assurance that the political cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 

inflation 

many of the company’s raw materials and operating expenses are sensitive to the effects of inflation which could result in changing operating costs furthermore recently implemented changes to us and other countries’ tariff and importexport regulations may have an unfavorable impact on raw materials pricing the effects of inflation on the company’s businesses during the fiscal years 2019  2018 and 2017 were immaterial 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically maintained a capital structure comprising a mix of equity and debt financing we vary our leverage both to optimize our equity return and to pursue acquisitions we expect to meet our current debt obligations as they come due through internally generated funds from current levels of operations andor through refinancing in the debt markets prior to the maturity dates of our debt 

we continually evaluate our debt facilities to assess whether they most efficiently and effectively meet the current and future needs of our business the company evaluates from time to time the appropriateness of its current leverage taking into consideration the company’s debt holders equity holders credit ratings acquisition opportunities and other factors the company’s debt leverage ratio which is computed as total debt divided by ebitda as defined for the applicable twelvemonth period has varied widely during the company’s history ranging from approximately 35 to 72 our debt leverage ratio at september 30 2019 was approximately 70  

if the company has excess cash it generally prioritizes allocating the excess cash in the following manner 1 capital spending at existing businesses 2 acquisitions of businesses 3 payment of a special dividend andor repurchases of our common stock and 4 prepayment of indebtedness or repurchase of debt whether the company undertakes common stock repurchases or other aforementioned activities will depend on prevailing market conditions the companys liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material in addition the company may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so 

the company’s ability to make scheduled interest payments on or to refinance the company’s indebtedness or to fund nonacquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on the company’s ability to generate cash in the future this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control 

as a result of the debt financing transactions completed during the fiscal year ended september 30 2019 as described in note 12 “debt” to the consolidated financial statements and completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as described in the paragraphs below and in note 26 subsequent events to the consolidated financial statements interest payments will increase going forward in accordance with the terms of the related debt agreements however in connection with the continued application of our three core valuedriven operating strategies obtaining profitable new business continually improving our cost structure and providing highly engineered valueadded products to customers we expect our efforts will continue to generate strong margins and provide more than sufficient cash provided by operating activities to meet our interest obligations and liquidity needs we believe our cash provided by operating activities and available borrowing capacity will enable us to make strategic business combinations pay dividends to our shareholders andor make opportunistic investments in our own stock 

on october 29 2019 the company entered into a purchase agreement in connection with a private offering of 265 billion aggregate principal amount in 550 senior subordinated notes due november 15 2027 the settlement of the debt financing transaction occurred on november 13 2019 the notes were issued at a price of 100 of their principal amount the company will use a portion of the net proceeds from the offering of the notes to redeem all of its outstanding aggregate principal amount of 115 billion 6000 senior subordinated notes due 2022 the remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes which may include potential future acquisitions dividends or repurchases under its stock repurchase program 

two recent divestitures of businesses within the nonaviation segment are expected to provide approximately 11 billion in gross cash proceeds to transdigm on september 20 2019 transdigm completed the divestiture of its esterline interface technology “eit” group of businesses to an affiliate of kps capital partners lp for approximately 190 million eit was acquired by transdigm as part of its approximately 40 billion acquisition of esterline in march 2019 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 transdigm is expected to complete the sale of the shares of the souriausunbank companies “souriausunbank” to eaton corporation plc for approximately 920 million souriausunbank was also acquired by transdigm as part of its acquisition of esterline 

on august 23 2019 the company paid a special cash dividend of 3000 on each outstanding share of common stock and cash dividend equivalent payments on options granted under its stock incentive plans the total cash payments related to the special dividend and dividend equivalent payments in fiscal 2019 were approximately 17 billion 

we do not anticipate declaring regular quarterly or annual cash dividends on our common stock in the near future any declaration of special cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations earnings capital requirements financial condition future prospects contractual restrictions under the senior secured credit facility and indentures the availability of surplus under delaware law and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors td group is a holding company and conducts all of its operations through direct and indirect subsidiaries unless td group receives dividends distributions advances transfers of funds or other payments from our subsidiaries td group will be unable to pay any dividends on our common stock in the future the ability of any subsidiaries to take any of the 

foregoing actions is limited by the terms of our senior secured credit facility and indentures and may be limited by future debt or other agreements that we may enter into 

in the future the company may increase its borrowings in connection with acquisitions if cash flow from operating activities becomes insufficient to fund current operations or for other shortterm cash needs or for stock repurchases or dividends our future leverage will also be impacted by the then current conditions of the credit markets

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixedrate and floatingrate longterm debt at september 30 2019  we had borrowings under our term loans of approximately 7524 million that were subject to interest rate risk borrowings under our term loans bear interest at our option at a rate equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted libor for a one two three or sixmonth or to the extent available to each lender nine or twelvemonth interest period chosen by us in each case plus an applicable margin percentage accordingly the company’s cash flows and earnings will be exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes resulting from variable rate borrowings under our term loans the companys objective is to maintain an allocation of at least 75 fixed rate and 25 variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in nearterm interest rates as of september 30 2019 approximately 83 of our debt was fixed rate debt the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the annual interest costs under our term loans by approximately 75 million based on the amount of outstanding borrowings at september 30 2019  the weighted average interest rate on the 7524 million of borrowings under our term loans on september 30 2019 was 48 

interest rate swaps and caps used to hedge and offset respectively the variable interest rates on the credit facility are described in note 21 “derivatives and hedging activities” to our consolidated financial statements included herein we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes 

for information about the fair value of the aggregate principal amount of borrowings under our term loans and the fair value of the notes see note 20 “fair value measurements” to our consolidated financial statements included herein 

foreign currency risk 

certain of our foreign subsidiaries’ sales and results of operations are subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations because our consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars increases or decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which we transact business could materially adversely affect our net sales net income and the carrying values of our assets located outside the us global economic uncertainty continues to exist strengthening of the us dollar relative to other currencies may adversely affect our operating results 

if the us dollar were to strengthen our foreign results of operations would be unfavorably impacted but the effect is not expected to be material a 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have resulted in a material impact to net income for the fiscal years ended september 30 2019 and 2018

we believe we are a leading global designer producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers we estimate that about 90 of our net sales for fiscal year 2018  were generated by proprietary products in addition for fiscal year 2018  we estimate that we generated about 80 of our net sales from products for which we are the sole source provider 

most of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue once our parts are designed into and sold on a new aircraft we generate net sales from aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft which is generally estimated to be approximately 25 to 30 years a typical platform can be produced for 20 to 30 years giving us an estimated product life cycle in excess of 50 years we estimate that approximately 60 of our net sales in fiscal year 2018  were generated from aftermarket sales the vast majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets these aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and been more stable than sales to original equipment manufacturers or oems 

products 

we primarily design produce and supply highly engineered proprietary aerospace components and certain systemssubsystems with significant aftermarket content we seek to develop highly customized products to solve specific needs for aircraft operators and manufacturers we attempt to differentiate ourselves based on engineering service and manufacturing capabilities we typically choose not to compete for nonproprietary “build to print” business because it frequently offers lower 

margins than proprietary products we believe that our products have strong brand names within the industry and that we have a reputation for high quality reliability and customer support 

our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products that we offer to our customers some of our more significant product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and engine technology specialized pumps and valves power conditioning devices specialized acdc electric motors and generators nicad batteries and chargers engineered latching and locking devices rods and locking devices engineered connectors and elastomers databus and power controls cockpit security components and systems specialized cockpit displays aircraft audio systems specialized lavatory components seat belts and safety restraints engineered interior surfaces and related components lighting and control technology military personnel parachutes high performance hoists winches and lifting devices and cargo loading handling and delivery systems 

segments 

the company’s businesses are organized and managed in three reporting segments power  control airframe and nonaviation 

the power  control segment includes operations that primarily develop produce and market systems and components that predominately provide power to or control power of the aircraft utilizing electronic fluid power and mechanical motion control technologies major product offerings include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and engine technology specialized pumps and valves power conditioning devices specialized acdc electric motors and generators databus and power controls high performance hoists winches and lifting devices and cargo loading and handling systems primary customers of this segment are engine and power system and subsystem suppliers airlines third party maintenance suppliers military buying agencies and repair depots products are sold in the oem and aftermarket market channels 

the airframe segment includes operations that primarily develop produce and market systems and components that are used in nonpower airframe applications utilizing airframe and cabin structure technologies major product offerings include engineered latching and locking devices rods and locking devices engineered connectors and elastomers cockpit security components and systems aircraft audio systems specialized lavatory components seat belts and safety restraints engineered interior surfaces and related components lighting and control technology military personnel parachutes and cargo delivery systems primary customers of this segment are airframe manufacturers and cabin system suppliers and subsystem suppliers airlines third party maintenance suppliers military buying agencies and repair depots products are sold in the oem and aftermarket market channels 

the nonaviation segment includes operations that primarily develop produce and market products for nonaviation markets major product offerings include seat belts and safety restraints for ground transportation applications mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls for space applications and refueling systems for heavy equipment used in mining construction and other industries primary customers of this segment are offroad vehicle suppliers and subsystem suppliers child restraint system suppliers satellite and space system suppliers and manufacturers of heavy equipment used in mining construction and other industries

consistent with our overall strategy our sales and marketing organization is structured to continually develop technical solutions that meet customer needs in particular we attempt to focus on products and programs that will lead to highmargin repeatable sales in the aftermarket 

we have structured our sales efforts along our major product offerings assigning a business unit manager to certain products each business unit manager is expected to grow the sales and profitability of the products for which he or she is responsible and to achieve the targeted annual level of bookings sales new business and profitability for such products the business unit managers are assisted by account managers and sales engineers who are responsible for covering major oem and aftermarket accounts account managers and sales engineers are expected to be familiar with the personnel organization and needs of specific customers to achieve total bookings and new business goals at each account and together with the business unit managers to determine when additional resources are required at customer locations most of our sales personnel are evaluated in part on their bookings and their ability to identify and obtain new business opportunities

the markets in which we sell our products are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced upswings and downturns the demand for our commercial aftermarket parts and services depends on among other things the breadth of our installed oem base revenue passenger miles “rpms” the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet the percentage of the worldwide fleet that is in warranty and airline profitability the demand for defense products is specifically dependent on government budget trends military campaigns and political pressures 

competition 

the niche markets within the aerospace industry that we serve are relatively fragmented and we face several competitors for many of the products and services we provide due to the global nature of the commercial aircraft industry competition in these categories comes from both us and foreign companies competitors in our product offerings range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privatelyheld entities with only one or two components in their entire product portfolios 

we compete on the basis of engineering manufacturing and marketing high quality products which we believe meet or exceed the performance and maintenance requirements of our customers consistent and timely delivery and superior customer service and support the industry’s stringent regulatory certification and technical requirements and the investments necessary in the development and certification of products may create disincentives for potential new competitors for certain products if customers receive products that meet or exceed expectations and performance standards we believe that they will have a reduced incentive to certify another supplier because of the cost and time of the technical design and testing certification process in addition we believe that the availability dependability and safety of our products are reasons for our customers to continue longterm supplier relationships 

government contracts 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 1 suspend us from receiving new contracts 2 terminate existing contracts 3 reduce the value of existing contracts 4 audit our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs 5 control and potentially prohibit the export of our products and 6 seek repayment of contract related payments under certain circumstances violations of government procurement laws could result in civil or criminal penalties 

governmental regulation 

the commercial aircraft component industry is highly regulated by the faa in the united states and by the joint aviation authorities in europe and other agencies throughout the world while the military aircraft component industry is governed by military quality specifications we and the components we manufacture are required to be certified by one or more of these entities or agencies and in many cases by individual oems in order to engineer and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models 

we must also satisfy the requirements of our customers including oems and airlines that are subject to faa regulations and provide these customers with products and services that comply with the government regulations applicable to commercial flight operations in addition the faa requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components we believe that we currently satisfy or exceed these maintenance standards in our repair and overhaul services we also maintain several faa approved repair stations 

in addition our businesses are subject to many other laws and requirements typically applicable to manufacturers and exporters without limiting the foregoing sales of many of our products that will be used on aircraft owned by foreign entities are subject to compliance with export control laws and the manufacture of our products and the operations of our businesses including the disposal of hazardous wastes are subject to compliance with applicable environmental laws 

market channels 

the commercial aerospace industry including the aftermarket and oem market is impacted by the health of the global economy and geopolitical events around the world the commercial aerospace industry has shown strength with increases in revenue passenger miles or rpms since 2010 and positive growth continued through 2018 with increases in rpms as well as the growth in the large commercial oem sector aircraft with 100 or more seats with order announcements by the boeing company and airbus sas leading to planned increases in production the 2019 leading indicators and industry consensus suggest a continuation of current trends in the commercial transport market sector supported by continued rpm growth and increases in production at the oem level 

the defense aerospace market is dependent on government budget constraints the timing of orders political pressures and the extent of global conflicts it is not necessarily affected by general economic conditions that affect the commercial aerospace industry 

our presence in both the commercial aerospace and military sectors of the aerospace industry may mitigate the impact on our business of any specific industry risk we service a diversified customer base in the commercial and military aerospace industry and we provide components to a diverse installed base of aircraft which mitigates our exposure to any individual airframe platform at times declines in sales in one channel have been offset by increased sales in another channel however due to differences between the profitability of our products sold to oem and aftermarket customers variation in product mix can cause variation in gross margin 

there are many shortterm factors including inventory corrections unannounced changes in order patterns strikes and mergers and acquisitions that can cause shortterm disruptions in our quarterly shipment patterns as compared to previous quarters and the same periods in prior years as such it can be difficult to determine longerterm trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons to normalize for shortterm fluctuations we tend to look at our performance over several quarters or years of activity rather than discrete shortterm periods 

there are also fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering and delivery requests from quartertoquarter as well as variations in product mix from quartertoquarter that may cause positive or negative variations in gross profit margins since commercial aftermarket sales have historically produced a higher gross margin than sales to commercial oems again in many instances these are timing events between quarters and must be balanced with macro aerospace industry indicators 

commercial aftermarket 

the key growth factors in the commercial aftermarket include worldwide rpms and the size and activity level of the worldwide fleet of aircraft and the percentage of the fleet that is in warranty 

commercial oem market 

the commercial transport market sector the largest sector in the commercial oem market grew modestly during 2018 our commercial transport oem shipments and revenues generally run ahead of the boeing and airbus airframe delivery schedules as a result and consistent with prior years our fiscal 2019 shipments will be a function of among other things the estimated 2019 and 2020 commercial airframe production rates we have been experiencing increased sales in the large commercial oem sector aircraft with 100 or more seats driven by an increase in production by the boeing company and airbus sas tied to previous order announcements industry consensus indicates this production increase will continue in 2019 and 2020 though the growth may continue to moderate and begin to flatten 

defense 

our military business fluctuates from year to year and is dependent to a degree on government budget constraints the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts for a variety of reasons the military spending outlook is very uncertain for planning purposes we assume that military related sales of our types of products to be flat in future years over the recent high levels 

raw materials 

we require the use of various raw materials in our manufacturing processes we also purchase a variety of manufactured component parts from various suppliers at times we concentrate our orders among a few suppliers in order to strengthen our supplier relationships most of our raw materials and component parts are generally available from multiple suppliers at competitive prices 

intellectual property 

we have various trade secrets proprietary information trademarks trade names patents copyrights and other intellectual property rights which we believe in the aggregate but not individually are important to our business 

backlog 

as of september 30 2018  the company estimated its sales order backlog at 2026 million compared to an estimated sales order backlog of 1669 million as of september 30 2017  the increase in estimated sales order backlog is primarily due to organic growth in the commercial and defense markets and growth from acquisitions the majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of september 30 2018  are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months purchase orders may be subject to cancellation or deferral by the customer prior to shipment the level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of the company’s receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled accordingly the company’s backlog as of september 30 2018  may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period 

foreign operations 

although we manufacture a significant portion of our products in the united states we manufacture some products in belgium china germany hungary japan malaysia mexico norway sri lanka sweden and the united kingdom although the majority of sales of our products are made to customers including distributors located in the united states our products are ultimately sold to and used by customers including airlines and other end users of aircraft throughout the world a number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including currency fluctuations difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies restrictions on the repatriation of funds change in trade policies tariff regulation difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition 

environmental matters 

our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things discharges of pollutants into the air and water the generation handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees environmental laws and regulations may require that the company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations certain facilities and thirdparty sites utilized by the company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws the company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws for information regarding environmental accruals see note 14 “environmental liabilities” to the consolidated financial statements included herein which is incorporated by reference 

employees 

as of september 30 2018  we had approximately 10100 fulltime parttime and temporary employees approximately 10 of our fulltime and parttime employees were represented by labor unions collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire at various dates ranging from december 2018 to may 2022 we consider our relationship with our employees generally to be satisfactory

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below are important risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business and financial condition and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

our commercial business is sensitive to the number of flight hours that our customers’ planes spend aloft the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and our customers’ profitability these items are in turn affected by general economic and geopolitical and other worldwide conditions 

our commercial business is directly affected by among other factors changes in revenue passenger miles rpms the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet the percentage of the fleet that is outofwarranty and changes in the profitability of the commercial airline industry rpms and airline profitability have historically been correlated with the general economic environment although national and international events also play a key role for example in the past the airline industry has been severely affected by the downturn in the global economy higher fuel prices the increased security concerns among airline customers following the events of september 11 2001 the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic and the conflicts abroad and could be impacted by future geopolitical or other worldwide events such as war terrorist acts or a worldwide infectious disease outbreak in addition global market and economic conditions have been challenging with turbulence in the us and international markets and economies and have prolonged declines in business and consumer spending as a result of the substantial reduction in airline traffic resulting from these events the airline industry incurred large losses and financial difficulties some carriers have also parked or retired a portion of their fleets and have reduced workforces and flights during periods of reduced airline profitability some airlines may delay purchases of spare parts preferring instead to deplete existing inventories and delay refurbishments and discretionary spending if demand for spare parts decreases there would be a decrease in demand for certain of our products an adverse change in demand could impact our results of operations collection of accounts receivable and our 

expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses which may adversely impact our financial condition and access to capital markets 

our sales to manufacturers of aircraft are cyclical and a downturn in sales to these manufacturers may adversely affect us 

our sales to manufacturers of large commercial aircraft such as the boeing company airbus sas and related oem suppliers as well as manufacturers of business jets which collectively accounted for approximately 24 of our net sales in fiscal year 2018  have historically experienced periodic downturns in the past these sales have been affected by airline profitability which is impacted by among other things fuel and labor costs price competition interest rates downturns in the global economy and national and international events in addition sales of our products to manufacturers of business jets are impacted by among other things downturns in the global economy downturns adversely affect our net sales gross margin and net income 

we rely heavily on certain customers for much of our sales 

our two largest customers for fiscal year 2018  were airbus sas which includes satair as and the boeing company which includes aviall inc airbus sas accounted for approximately 11 of our net sales and the boeing company accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales in fiscal year 2018  our top ten customers for fiscal year 2018  accounted for approximately 43 of our net sales a material reduction in purchasing by one of our larger customers for any reason including but not limited to economic downturn decreased production strike or resourcing could have a material adverse effect on our net sales gross margin and net income 

we generally do not have guaranteed future sales of our products further when we enter into fixed price contracts with some of our customers we take the risk for cost overruns 

as is customary in our business we do not generally have longterm contracts with most of our aftermarket customers and therefore do not have guaranteed future sales although we have longterm contracts with many of our oem customers many of those customers may terminate the contracts on short notice and in most cases our customers have not committed to buy any minimum quantity of our products in addition in certain cases we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon the historic purchasing patterns of customers and upon our discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements and this anticipated future volume of orders may not materialize 

we also have entered into multiyear fixedprice contracts with some of our customers pursuant to which we have agreed to perform the work for a fixed price and accordingly realize all the benefit or detriment resulting from any decreases or increases in the costs of making these products sometimes we accept a fixedprice contract for a product that we have not yet produced and this increases the risk of cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product most of our contracts do not permit us to recover increases in raw material prices taxes or labor costs 

us military spending is dependent upon the us defense budget 

the military and defense market is significantly dependent upon government budget trends particularly the us department of defense the “dod” budget in addition to normal business risks our supply of products to the united states government is subject to unique risks largely beyond our control dod budgets could be negatively impacted by several factors including but not limited to a change in defense spending policy by the current presidential administration the us government’s budget deficits spending priorities the cost of sustaining the us military presence internationally and possible political pressure to reduce us government military spending each of which could cause the dod budget to remain unchanged or to decline a significant decline in us military expenditures could result in a reduction in the amount of our products sold to the various agencies and buying organizations of the us government 

we intend to pursue acquisitions our business may be adversely affected if we cannot consummate acquisitions on satisfactory terms or if we cannot effectively integrate acquired operations 

a significant portion of our growth has occurred through acquisitions any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions we intend to pursue acquisitions that we believe will present opportunities consistent with our overall business strategy however we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates to purchase or may be unable to acquire desired businesses or assets on economically acceptable terms or may be unable to receive necessary regulatory approvals or support in addition we may not be able to raise the capital necessary to fund future acquisitions because we may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously we may encounter unforeseen expenses complications and delays including regulatory complications or difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight 

we regularly engage in discussions with respect to potential acquisition and investment opportunities if we consummate an acquisition our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly future acquisitions could result in margin dilution and further likely result in the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest and 

amortization expenses or periodic impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets as well as significant charges relating to integration costs 

acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect in addition we may not be able to successfully integrate any business we acquire into our existing business the successful integration of new businesses depends on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs the successful integration of future acquisitions may also require substantial attention from our senior management and the management of the acquired business which could decrease the time that they have to service attract customers and develop new products and services or attend to other acquisition opportunities 

we are subject to many of the foregoing risks in connection with our recently announced agreement to acquire esterline and these risks may be exacerbated due to the scale and complexity of that acquisition as compared to our recent acquisitions the acquisition is not expected to close until 2019 subject to approval of esterline’s shareholders as well as other customary closing conditions including the receipt of required regulatory approvals so there can be no assurance that we will not encounter unforeseen expenses complications and delays in the process or that we will be able to consummate the acquisition as contemplated or at all if the acquisition is completed it will require extensive integration efforts these efforts could result in significant unforeseen costs and will require substantial attention from our senior management if we are unable to successfully integrate esterline or the acquisition otherwise does not perform to our expectations our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected it is also possible that the substantial management attention required by and the indebtedness to be incurred in connection with the transaction could cause us to forgo other acquisition opportunities particularly if we encounter delays or unexpected costs or the acquisition otherwise does not perform to our expectations 

we are subject to certain unique business risks as a result of supplying equipment and services to the us government 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 

 most of our us government contracts can be terminated by the us government for its convenience without significant notice termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination 

on contracts for which the price is based on cost the us government may review our costs and performance as well as our accounting and general business practices based on the results of such audits the us government may adjust our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs in addition under us government purchasing regulations some of our costs including most financing costs amortization of intangible assets portions of research and development costs and certain marketing expenses may not be subject to reimbursement 

furthermore even where the price is not based on cost the us government may seek to review our costs to determine whether our pricing is “fair and reasonable” our subsidiaries are periodically subject to a pricing review and in fact government buying agencies that purchase some of our subsidiaries’ products are currently the subject of a dod office of inspector general audit with respect to prices paid for such products pricing reviews and government audits including the one underway could be costly and time consuming for our management and could distract from our ability to effectively manage the business as a result of such a review we could be subject to providing a refund to the us government or we could be asked to enter into an arrangement whereby our prices would be based on cost or the dod could seek to pursue alternative sources of supply for our parts any of those occurrences could lead to a reduction in our revenue from or the profitability of certain of our supply arrangements with certain agencies and buying organizations of the us government 

moreover us government purchasing regulations contain a number of additional operational requirements which do not apply to entities not engaged in government contracting failure to comply with such government contracting requirements could result in civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

our business may be adversely affected if we would lose our government or industry approvals or if more stringent government regulations are enacted or if industry oversight is increased 

the aerospace industry is highly regulated in the united states and in other countries in order to sell our components we and the components we manufacture must be certified by the faa the dod and similar agencies in foreign countries and by individual manufacturers if new and more stringent government regulations are adopted or if industry oversight increases we 

might incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or heightened industry oversight in addition if material authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended our business would be adversely affected 

in addition to the aviation approvals we are at times required to obtain approval from us government agencies to export our products failure to obtain approval to export or determination by the us government that we failed to receive required approvals or licenses could eliminate or restrict our ability to sell our products outside the united states and the penalties that could be imposed by the us government for failure to comply with these laws could be significant 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and could harm our ability to react to changes to our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of september 30 2018  our total indebtedness excluding approximately 175 million  of letters of credit outstanding was approximately 129 billion  which was 1163  of our total book capitalization as a result of our prior year special dividends being funded in part with indebtedness and the addition of approximately 11 billion  in net new incremental borrowings during fiscal 2018  

also in connection with the merger agreement to acquire esterline for approximately 4 billion the company entered into a commitment letter for a senior secured term facility up to 37 billion the actual amount and timing of the new senior secured term facility is subject to the closing of the esterline acquisition and the cash on hand at that time 

in addition we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future for example as of september 30 2018  we had approximately 5825 million  of unused commitments under our revolving loan facility although our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the various senior subordinated notes outstanding the “indentures” contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these qualifications and exceptions could be substantial for example if the usage of the revolving loan facility exceeds 25 of the total revolving commitments the company will be required to maintain a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio of net debt as defined to trailing fourquarter ebitda as defined a breach of any of the covenants or an inability to comply with the required leverage ratio could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the indentures 

an increase in our substantial indebtedness could also have other important consequences to investors for example it could 

 in addition all of our debt under the senior secured credit facility which includes 76 billion  in term loans and a revolving loan facility of 600 million  bears interest at variable rates accordingly if interest rates increase our debt service expense will also increase interest rate swap and cap agreements are used to manage interest rate risk associated with variable rate borrowings under our credit facilities for information about our interest rate swap and cap agreements see note 20 “derivatives and hedging instruments” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness including the indentures we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital 

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness including the indentures amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility amounts due under our securitization facility and to fund our operations will depend on our ability 

to generate cash in the future which to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness including the amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility amounts borrowed under our securitization facility and the indentures or to fund our other liquidity needs if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital we cannot assure that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations the terms of existing or future debt instruments the securitization facility the indentures and the senior secured credit facility may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives in addition any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms and would otherwise adversely affect the indentures 

the terms of the senior secured credit facility and indentures may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

our senior secured credit facility and the indentures contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indentures and may limit their ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests the senior secured credit facility and indentures include covenants restricting among other things the ability of td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indentures to 

 a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the indentures if any such default occurs the lenders under the senior secured credit facility and the holders of the senior subordinated notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder to be immediately due and payable the lenders under the senior secured credit facility also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings in addition following an event of default under the senior secured credit facility the lenders under that facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which includes our available cash and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the senior subordinated notes if the debt under the senior secured credit facility or the senior subordinated notes were to be accelerated we cannot assure that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations 

our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things discharges of pollutants into the air and water the generation handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees environmental laws and regulations may require that the company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations certain facilities and thirdparty sites utilized by subsidiaries of the company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws the company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws 

estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are based on current facts laws regulations and technology these estimates take into consideration the company’s prior experience and professional judgment of the company’s environmental advisors estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination the range of remediation alternatives available evolving remediation standards imprecise engineering evaluations and cost estimates the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 

accordingly as investigation and remediation proceed it is likely that adjustments in the company’s accruals will be necessary to reflect new information the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in a given period based on currently available information however the company does not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition 

we are dependent on our senior management team and highly trained employees and any work stoppage or difficulty hiring similar employees could adversely affect our business 

because our products are complicated and highly engineered we depend on an educated and trained workforce there is substantial competition for skilled personnel in the aircraft component industry and we could be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled employees we may not be able to fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover or attract and retain qualified personnel 

although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory we cannot assure that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory renewal of collective bargaining agreements or that our employee relations will remain stable because we maintain a relatively small inventory of finished goods any work stoppage could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide products to our customers 

in addition our success depends in part on our ability to attract and motivate our senior management and key employees achieving this objective may be difficult due to a variety of factors including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions competitors’ hiring practices and the effectiveness of our compensation programs competition for qualified personnel can be intense a loss of senior management and key personnel or failure to attract qualified new talent could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and our operating results andor market value could be adversely affected  the board continually monitors this risk and we believe that the board’s succession plan together with our straightforward strategy clear value drivers decentralized nature and the quality of managers running our operating units helps to mitigate this risk 

we may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings including fair labor standards act and state wage and hour class action lawsuits which may adversely affect our business and financial performance 

from time to time we are involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of business these actions and proceedings may involve claims for among other things compensation for alleged personal injury workers’ compensation employment discrimination or breach of contract in addition we may be subject to class action lawsuits including those involving allegations of violations of consumer product statutes or the fair labor standards act and state wage and hour laws due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions or proceedings the outcome of litigation particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions is difficult to assess or quantify as plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts in these types of lawsuits and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time in addition plaintiffs in many types of actions may seek punitive damages civil penalties consequential damages or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief these proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves the ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement mediation or court judgment could have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business is dependent on the availability of certain components and raw materials from suppliers 

our business is affected by the price and availability of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our components our business therefore could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our suppliers such as the destruction of our suppliers’ facilities or their distribution infrastructure a work stoppage or strike by our suppliers’ employees or the failure of our suppliers to provide materials of the requisite quality or by increased costs of such raw materials or components if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers because we maintain a relatively small inventory of raw materials and component parts our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers or alternative raw materials or component parts the lengthy and expensive faa and oem certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier raw material or component part 

our operations depend on our manufacturing facilities which are subject to physical and other risks that could disrupt production 

a number of our manufacturing facilities are located in the greater los angeles area an area known for earthquakes and are thus vulnerable to damage in addition a number of our manufacturing facilities are located along the eastern seaboard area susceptible to hurricanes we are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters including power loss fire explosions floods communications failures terrorist attacks and similar events disruptions could also occur due to cyberattacks computer or equipment malfunction accidental or intentional operator error or process failures any disruption of our ability to operate our business could result in a material decrease in our revenues or significant additional costs to replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

operations and sales outside of the united states may be subject to additional risks 

a number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including currency fluctuations difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies restrictions on the repatriation of funds change in trade policies tariff regulation difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition furthermore the company is subject to laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act uk bribery act and similar local antibribery laws which generally prohibit companies and their employees agents and contractors from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure to comply with these laws could subject the company to civil and criminal penalties that could materially adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

we face significant competition 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry and compete against a number of companies competitors in our product lines are both us and foreign companies and range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privately held entities we believe that our ability to compete depends on high product performance consistent high quality short leadtime and timely delivery competitive pricing superior customer service and support and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs we may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive 

we could be adversely affected if one of our components causes an aircraft to crash 

our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we have designed manufactured or serviced while we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future product liability claims in the event of product liability claims our insurers may attempt to deny coverage or any coverage we have may not be adequate we also may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost any liability not covered by insurance or for which third party indemnification is not available could result in significant liability to us 

in addition a crash caused by one of our components could damage our reputation for quality products we believe our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting a provider of aircraft components if a crash were to be caused by one of our components or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of data protection concerns 

the interpretation and application of data protection laws in the us europe including but not limited to the general data protection regulation the “gdpr” and elsewhere are uncertain and evolving it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices complying with these various laws is difficult and could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business further although we are implementing internal controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the gdpr and other privacyrelated laws rules and regulations collectively the “data protection laws” there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures will enable us to be fully compliant with all data protection laws 

despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and confidential and personal data comply with applicable laws rules and regulations and implement data security measures our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to security breaches and other data loss including cyberattacks and in fact we have experienced data security incidents that have not had a material impact on our financial results in addition it is not possible to predict the impact on our business of the future loss alteration or misappropriation of information in our possession related to us our employees former employees customers suppliers or others this could lead to negative publicity legal claims theft modification or destruction of proprietary information or key information damage to or inaccessibility of critical systems manufacture of defective products production downtimes operational disruptions and other significant costs which could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and results of operations 

we have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets which may never generate the returns we expect 

mergers and acquisitions have resulted in significant increases in identifiable intangible assets and goodwill identifiable intangible assets which primarily include trademarks trade names trade secrets and technology were approximately 18 billion  at september 30 2018  representing approximately 15  of our total assets goodwill recognized in accounting for the mergers and acquisitions was approximately 62 billion  at september 30 2018  representing approximately 51  of our total assets we may never realize the full value of our identifiable intangible assets and goodwill and to the extent we were to determine that our identifiable intangible assets or our goodwill were impaired within the meaning of applicable accounting standards we would be required to writeoff the amount of any impairment 

the company may be subject to risks relating to changes in its tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities 

          the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and various nonus jurisdictions the company’s domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions the company’s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the company’s effective tax rate as a result of changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets challenges by tax authorities or changes in tax laws or regulations in addition the amount of income taxes paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company’s tax liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

our stock price may be volatile and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 

         there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities which is unrelated to the operating performance of the companies issuing the securities these market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock shareholders may not be able to sell their shares at or above the purchase price due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock such changes could be caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects including possible changes due to the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry and other factors such as fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering which could cause shortterm swings in profit margins or such changes could be unrelated to our operating performance such as changes in market conditions affecting the stock market generally or the stocks of aerospace companies or changes in the outlook for our common stock such as changes to or the confidence in our business strategy changes to or confidence in our management or expectations for future growth of the company 

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our share price 

we may sell additional shares of common stock into the public markets or issue convertible debt securities to raise capital in the future the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public markets or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities to raise capital at a time and price that we deem appropriate 

our corporate documents and delaware law contain certain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable for example our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 149600000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock without stockholder approval the board of directors has the authority to attach special rights including voting and dividend rights to this preferred stock with these rights holders of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75 of the voting power of our issued and outstanding capital stock voting together as a single class is required for the alteration amendment or repeal of certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and certain provisions of our amended and restated bylaws including the provisions relating to our stockholders’ ability to call special meetings notice provisions for stockholder business to be conducted at an annual meeting requests for stockholder lists and corporate records nomination and removal of directors and filling of vacancies on our board of directors 

we are also subject to the antitakeover provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law under these provisions if anyone becomes an “interested stockholder” we may not enter into a “business combination” with that person for three years without special approval which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change of control for purposes of section 203 “interested stockholder” means generally someone owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years subject to certain exceptions as described in section 203 

we do not regularly declare and pay quarterly or annual cash dividends on our stock 

on july 3 2013 june 4 2014 october 14 2016 and august 23 2017 the company’s board of directors authorized and declared special cash dividends of 2200 2500 2400 and 2200 respectively on each outstanding share of common stock and cash dividend equivalent payments to holders of options under its stock option plans 

notwithstanding the special cash dividends we do not anticipate declaring regular quarterly or annual cash dividends on our common stock or any other equity security in the foreseeable future the amounts that may be available to us to pay future special cash dividends are restricted under our debt and other agreements any payment of special cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations earnings capital requirements financial condition future prospects contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors therefore shareholders should not rely on regular quarterly or annual dividend income from shares of our common stock and should not rely on special dividends with any regularity or at all

 item 7 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected financial data” and td group’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report the following discussion may contain predictions estimates and other forwardlooking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties including those discussed under the heading entitled “risk factors” included elsewhere in this report these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 

overview 

for fiscal year 2018  we generated net sales of 38111 million  gross profit of 21775 million  or 571  of sales and net income of 9571 million  we believe we have achieved steady longterm growth in sales and improvements in operating performance since our formation in 1993 due to our competitive strengths and through execution of our valuedriven operating strategy more specifically focusing our businesses on our valuedriven operating strategy of obtaining profitable new business carefully controlling the cost structure and pricing our highly engineered valueadded products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so has historically resulted in improvements in gross profit and income from operations over the long term 

our selective acquisition strategy has also contributed to the growth of our business the integration of certain acquisitions into our existing businesses combined with implementing our proven operating strategy has historically resulted in improvements of the financial performance of the acquired business 

we believe our key competitive strengths include 

large and growing installed product base with aftermarket revenue stream  we provide components to a large and growing installed base of aircraft to which we supply aftermarket products we estimate that our products are installed on approximately 95000 commercial transport regional transport military and general aviation fixed wing turbine aircraft and rotary wing aircraft 

diversified revenue base  we believe that our diversified revenue base reduces our dependence on any particular product platform or market channel and has been a significant factor in maintaining our financial performance our products are installed on almost all of the major commercial aircraft platforms now in production we expect to continue to develop new products for military and commercial applications 

barriers to entry  we believe that the niche nature of our markets the industry’s stringent regulatory and certification requirements the large number of products that we sell and the investments necessary to develop and certify products create potential disincentives to competition for certain products 

our business strategy is made up of two key elements 1 a valuedriven operating strategy focused around our three core value drivers and 2 a selective acquisition strategy 

valuedriven operating strategy  our three core value drivers are 

 selective acquisition strategy  we selectively pursue the acquisition of proprietary aerospace component businesses when we see an opportunity to create value through the application of our three core valuedriven operating strategies the aerospace industry in particular remains highly fragmented with many of the companies in the industry being small private businesses or small noncore operations of larger businesses we have significant experience among our management team in executing acquisitions and integrating acquired businesses into our company and culture as of the date of this report we have successfully acquired approximately 70 businesses andor product lines since our formation in 1993 many of these acquisitions have been integrated into an existing transdigm production facility which enables a higher production capacity utilization which in turn improves gross profit levels due to the ability to spread the fixed manufacturing overhead costs over higher production volume 

acquisitions and the divestiture during the most recent three fiscal years are more fully described in note 2 “acquisitions and divestitures” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations however investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 

below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions for additional accounting policies see note 3 “summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

revenue recognition and related allowances  revenue is recognized from the sale of products when title and risk of loss passes to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment substantially all product sales are made pursuant to firm fixedprice purchase orders received from customers collectibility of amounts recorded as revenue is reasonably assured at the time of sale provisions for returns uncollectible accounts and the cost of repairs under contract warranty provisions are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are principally based on historical results modified as appropriate by the most current information available we have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of such allowances however due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process it is possible that actual results may vary from the estimates and the differences could be material 

allowance for uncollectible accounts management estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable and customer creditworthiness the allowance also incorporates a provision for the estimated impact of disputes with customers management’s estimate of the allowance amounts that are necessary includes amounts for specifically identified credit losses and estimated credit losses based on historical information the determination of the amount of the allowance for uncollectible accounts is subject to significant levels of judgment and estimation by management depending on the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues or if the financial condition of any of the company’s customers were to deteriorate and their ability to make required payments were to become impaired increases in these allowances may be required historically changes in estimates in the allowance for uncollectible accounts have not been significant 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost of inventories is generally determined by the average cost and the firstin firstout fifo methods and includes material labor and overhead related to the manufacturing process because the company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be inservice for 25 or more years it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use where management estimated that the net realizable value was below cost or determined that future demand was lower than current inventory levels based on historical experience current and projected market demand current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value was made by recording a provision included in cost of sales although management believes that the company’s estimates of excess and obsolete inventory are reasonable actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future in addition in accordance with industry practice all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year historically changes in estimates in the net realizable value of inventories have not been significant 

goodwill and other intangible assets  in accordance with asc 805 “business combinations” the company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized as goodwill the valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results in addition to using management estimates and negotiated amounts the company used a variety of information sources to determine the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including thirdparty appraisals for the estimated value and lives of identifiable intangible assets   fair value adjustments to the company’s assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition  

intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights or if the intangible asset can be sold transferred licensed or exchanged regardless of the company’s intent to do so goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition and are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates 

gaap requires that the annual and any interim impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level the reporting unit level is one level below an operating segment substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each reporting 

unit pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction with respect to acquisitions integrated into an existing reporting unit any acquired goodwill is combined with the goodwill of the reporting unit 

at the time of goodwill impairment testing the company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test the quantitative test is required only if the company concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount or if the company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit for the quantitative test management determines the estimated fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit if the calculated estimated fair value is less than the current carrying value impairment of goodwill of the reporting unit may exist the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing includes discount rates growth rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates are set by using the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” methodology the wacc methodology considers market and industry data as well as company specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business 

management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates as an indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately through the use of the discounted cash flow valuation model the aggregate of all reporting unit’s estimated fair value is reconciled to the total market capitalization of the company 

the company had 35 reporting units with goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 the date of the last annual impairment test the estimated fair values of each of the reporting units was substantially in excess of their respective carrying values and therefore no goodwill impairment was recorded the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate which is a significant assumption in the calculation of fair values with a one percentage point increase in the discount rate nearly all of the reporting units would continue to have fair values substantially in excess of their respective carrying values 

management tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at the asset level as determined by appropriate asset valuation at the time of acquisition the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets consists of a comparison between the estimated fair values and carrying values if the carrying amounts of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives exceed their estimated fair values an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference management utilizes the royalty savings valuation method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset in this method management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset the key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates royalty rates growth rates sales projections and terminal value rates discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the wacc methodology considering any differences in companyspecific risk factors between reporting units and the indefinitelived intangible assets royalty rates are established by management with the advice of valuation experts and periodically substantiated by valuation experts management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant intangible asset terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates 

the discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed actual results could differ from these assumptions management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering the current economic conditions 

stockbased compensation  the cost of the company’s stockbased compensation is recorded in accordance with asc 718 “stock compensation” the company uses a blackscholesmerton option pricing model to estimate the grantdate fair value of the stock options awarded the blackscholesmerton model requires assumptions regarding the expected volatility of the company’s common shares the riskfree interest rate the expected life of the stock options award and the company’s dividend yield the company utilizes historical data in determining these assumptions an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside of management’s control could have an impact on the blackscholesmerton model 

income taxes  the company estimates income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates this involves estimating taxable earnings specific taxable and deductible items the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits to the extent these estimates change adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes are made in the period in which the changes occur historically such adjustments have not been significant 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain operating data of the company including presentation of the amounts as a percentage of net sales amounts in thousands 



fiscal year ended september 30 2018  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2017   

total company 

net sales  net organic sales and acquisition sales and the related dollar and percentage changes for the fiscal years ended september 30 2018  and 2017  were as follows amounts in millions 



acquisition sales represent sales of acquired businesses for the period up to one year subsequent to their acquisition date the amount of acquisition sales shown in the table above was attributable to the acquisitions of kirkhill extant and skandia in fiscal year 2018 and the third quarter 2017 acquisitions described in note 2 “acquisitions and divestitures” 

the increase in organic sales was primarily driven by commercial aftermarket sales increasing by 1096 million  or 90  defense sales increasing by 623 million  or 53  and commercial oem sales increasing by 75 million  or 08  

cost of sales and gross profit  cost of sales increased by 1139 million  or 75  to 16336 million  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  compared to 15197 million  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2017  cost of sales and the related percentage of total sales for the fiscal years ended september 30 2018  and 2017  were as follows amounts in millions 



the net increase in the dollar amount of cost of sales during the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  was primarily due to increased volume associated with the sales from acquisitions and organic sales growth offset by a reduction in purchase accounting adjustments on inventory and a benefit from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 

gross profit as a percentage of sales increased by 05  percentage points to 571  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  from 566  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2017  the dollar amount of gross profit increased by 1929 million  or 97  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  compared to the comparable period last year due to the following items 



selling and administrative expenses  selling and administrative expenses increased by 345 million  to 4501 million  or 118  of sales for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  from 4156 million  or 119  of sales for the comparable period last year selling and administrative expenses and the related percentage of total sales for the fiscal years ended september 30 2018  and 2017  were as follows amounts in millions 



the increase in the dollar amount of selling and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  is primarily due to an increase in stock compensation expense of 116 million  higher selling and administrative expenses from organic sales growth of 114 million and recent acquisitions of approximately 104 million which was approximately 9 of acquisition sales and an increase in acquisitionrelated expenses of 11 million  

amortization of intangible assets  amortization of intangible assets decreased 168 million  to 724 million  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  from 892 million  for the comparable period last year the net decrease was primarily due to the order backlog recorded in connection with the young  franklintactair and data device corporation acquisitions becoming fully amortized prior to fiscal 2018 this is slightly offset by amortization expense on the definitelived intangible assets ie technology and order backlog recorded in connection with the skandia extant kirkhill and the third quarter 2017 acquisitions 

refinancing costs  refinancing costs of 64 million  were recorded during the year ended september 30 2018  representing debt issuance costs expensed in connection with the debt financing activity as disclosed in note 11 debt to the consolidated financial statements refinancing costs of 398 million recorded during the fiscal year ended september 30 2017 primarily consisted of 288 million in premium paid on the redemption of the 2021 notes and the writeoff of 31 million in unamortized debt issuance costs   and debt issuance costs expensed in connection with new debt issuance that occurred in fiscal 2017   

interest expensenet  interest expensenet includes interest on borrowings outstanding amortization of debt issuance costs original issue discount and premium and revolving credit facility fees offset by interest income interest expensenet increased  604 million  or 100  to 6630 million  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  from 6026 million  for the comparable period last year the net increase in interest expensenet was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average level of outstanding borrowings which was approximately 12603 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  compared to approximately 10993 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2017  the weighted average cash interest rate was at 51 during the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  compared to 53 in the prior year the increase in weighted average level of borrowings was primarily due to the activity in the third fiscal quarter of 2018 consisting of the incurrence of additional term loans of 700 million gross 500 million in 6875 2026 senior subordinated notes an additional 100 million drawn on the trade receivable securitization facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and additional net debt financing of 575 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 the increases in new debt described above was partially offset by principal payments on the term loans over the comparable period the weighted average interest rate for cash interest payments on total borrowings outstanding at september 30 2018  was 52 

income taxes  income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately 24  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  compared to 249  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2017  the company’s lower effective tax rate for year ended september 30 2018 was primarily due to a reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate that was enacted in the tax cuts and jobs act “the act” which reduced the tax rate from 35 to 21 as well the onetime impact related to the remeasurement of us deferred tax liabilities under the act as a result the blended statutory tax rate for the fiscal year is 245 the company’s effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended september 30 2017 was less than the federal statutory tax rate due primarily to excess tax benefits on equity compensation foreign earnings taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rates and the domestic manufacturing deduction the decrease in the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  compared to the fiscal year ended september 30 2017  was primarily due to the reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate and the onetime impact under the act 

loss from discontinued operations  on january 26 2018 the company completed the sale of schroth in a management buy out to a private equity fund and certain members of schroth management for approximately 614 million which includes a

our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately 13551 million  13189 million  and 11695 million  for the fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks including foreign currency fluctuations the impact of foreign government regulations political uncertainties and differences in business practices there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments’ countries furthermore there can be no assurance that the political cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 

inflation 

many of the company’s raw materials and operating expenses are sensitive to the effects of inflation which could result in changing operating costs furthermore recently implemented changes to us and other countries’ tariff and importexport regulations may have an unfavorable impact on raw materials pricing the effects of inflation on the company’s businesses during the fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  were immaterial 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically maintained a capital structure comprising a mix of equity and debt financing we vary our leverage both to optimize our equity return and to pursue acquisitions we expect to meet our current debt obligations as they come due through internally generated funds from current levels of operations andor through refinancing in the debt markets prior to the maturity dates of our debt 

we continually evaluate our debt facilities to assess whether they most efficiently and effectively meet the current and future needs of our business the company evaluates from time to time the appropriateness of its current leverage taking into consideration the company’s debt holders equity holders credit ratings acquisition opportunities and other factors the company’s debt leverage ratio which is computed as total debt divided by ebitda as defined for the applicable twelvemonth period has varied widely during the company’s history ranging from approximately 35 to 72 our debt leverage ratio at september 30 2018  was approximately 69  

if the company has excess cash it generally prioritizes allocating the excess cash in the following manner 1 capital spending at existing businesses 2 acquisitions of businesses 3 payment of a special dividend andor repurchases of our common stock and 4 prepayment of indebtedness or repurchase of debt whether the company undertakes additional common stock repurchases or other aforementioned activities will depend on prevailing market conditions the company’s liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material in addition the company may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so 

the company’s ability to make scheduled interest payments on or to refinance the company’s indebtedness or to fund nonacquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on the company’s ability to generate cash in the future this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control 

as a result of the additional debt financing during the fiscal year ended september 30 2018 interest payments will increase going forward in accordance with the terms of the related debt agreements however in connection with the continued application of our three core valuedriven operating strategies obtaining profitable new business continually improving our cost structure and providing highly engineered valueadded products to customers we expect our efforts will continue to generate strong margins and provide more than sufficient cash from operating activities to meet our interest obligations and liquidity needs we believe our cash from operations and available borrowing capacity will enable us to make opportunistic investments in our own stock make strategic business combinations andor pay dividends to our shareholders 

in connection with the merger agreement to acquire esterline for approximately 4 billion the company entered into a commitment letter for a senior secured term facility up to 37 billion the actual amount and timing of the new senior secured term facility is subject to the closing of the esterline acquisition and the cash on hand at that time the merger is anticipated to close in 2019 subject to approval of esterline’s shareholders as well as other customary closing conditions including the receipt of required regulatory approvals 

in the future the company may increase its borrowings in connection with acquisitions if cash flow from operating activities becomes insufficient to fund current operations or for other shortterm cash needs or for stock repurchases or dividends our future leverage will also be impacted by the then current conditions of the credit markets

interest rate risk 

our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixedrate and floatingrate longterm debt at september 30 2018  we had borrowings under our term loans of approximately 7600 million  that were subject to interest rate risk borrowings under our term loans bear interest at our option at a rate equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted libor for a one two three or sixmonth or to the extent available to each lender nine or twelvemonth interest period chosen by us in each case plus an applicable margin percentage accordingly the company’s cash flows and earnings will be exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes resulting from variable rate borrowings under our term loans the companys objective is to maintain an allocation of approximately 75 fixed rate and 25 variable rate debt thereby limiting its exposure to changes in nearterm interest rates the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the annual interest costs under our term loans by approximately 76 million based on the amount of outstanding borrowings at september 30 2018  the weighted average interest rate on the 7600 million  of borrowings under our term loans on september 30 2018  was 45

 item 1 business 

the company 

transdigm inc was formed in 1993 in connection with a leveraged buyout transaction td group was formed in 2003 to facilitate a leveraged buyout of transdigm inc the company was owned by private equity funds until its initial public offering in 2006 td group’s common stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange or nyse under the ticker symbol “tdg” 

we believe we are a leading global designer producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers we estimate that about 90 of our net sales for fiscal year 2017  were generated by proprietary products in addition for fiscal year 2017  we estimate that we generated about 80 of our net sales from products for which we are the sole source provider 

most of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue once our parts are designed into and sold on a new aircraft we generate net sales from aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft which is generally estimated to be approximately 25 to 30 years a typical platform can be produced for 20 to 30 years giving us an estimated product life cycle in excess of 50 years we estimate that approximately 55 of our net sales in fiscal year 2017  were generated from aftermarket sales the vast majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets these aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and been more stable than sales to original equipment manufacturers or oems 

products 

we primarily design produce and supply highly engineered proprietary aerospace components and certain systemssubsystems with significant aftermarket content we seek to develop highly customized products to solve specific needs for aircraft operators and manufacturers we attempt to differentiate ourselves based on engineering service and manufacturing capabilities we typically choose not to compete for nonproprietary “build to print” business because it frequently offers lower margins than proprietary products we believe that our products have strong brand names within the industry and that we have a reputation for high quality reliability and customer support 

our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products that we offer to our customers some of our more significant product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and engine technology specialized pumps and valves power conditioning devices specialized acdc electric motors and generators nicad batteries and chargers engineered latching and locking devices rods and locking devices engineered connectors and elastomers databus and power controls cockpit security components and systems specialized cockpit displays aircraft audio systems specialized lavatory components seat belts and safety restraints engineered interior surfaces and related components lighting and control technology military personnel parachutes high performance hoists winches and lifting devices and cargo loading handling and delivery systems 

segments 

the company’s businesses are organized and managed in three reporting segments power  control airframe and nonaviation 

the power  control segment includes operations that primarily develop produce and market systems and components that predominately provide power to or control power of the aircraft utilizing electronic fluid power and mechanical motion control technologies major product offerings include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and engine technology specialized pumps and valves power conditioning devices specialized acdc electric motors and generators databus and power controls high performance hoists winches and lifting devices and cargo loading and handling systems primary customers of this segment are engine and power system and subsystem suppliers airlines third party maintenance suppliers military buying agencies and repair depots products are sold in the oem and aftermarket market channels 

the airframe segment includes operations that primarily develop produce and market systems and components that are used in nonpower airframe applications utilizing airframe and cabin structure technologies major product offerings include engineered latching and locking devices rods and locking devices engineered connectors and elastomers cockpit security components and systems aircraft audio systems specialized lavatory components seat belts and safety restraints engineered interior surfaces and related components lighting and control technology military personnel parachutes and cargo delivery systems primary customers of this segment are airframe manufacturers and cabin system suppliers and subsystem suppliers airlines third party maintenance suppliers military buying agencies and repair depots products are sold in the oem and aftermarket market channels 

the nonaviation segment includes operations that primarily develop produce and market products for nonaviation markets major product offerings include seat belts and safety restraints for ground transportation applications mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls for space applications and refueling systems for heavy equipment used in mining construction and other industries primary customers of this segment are offroad vehicle suppliers and subsystem suppliers child restraint system suppliers satellite and space system suppliers and manufacturers of heavy equipment used in mining construction and other industries 

for financial information about our segments see note 16 “segments” to our consolidated financial statements included herein 

sales and marketing 

consistent with our overall strategy our sales and marketing organization is structured to continually develop technical solutions that meet customer needs in particular we attempt to focus on products and programs that will lead to highmargin repeatable sales in the aftermarket 

we have structured our sales efforts along our major product offerings assigning a business unit manager to certain products each business unit manager is expected to grow the sales and profitability of the products for which he or she is responsible and to achieve the targeted annual level of bookings sales new business and profitability for such products the business unit managers are assisted by account managers and sales engineers who are responsible for covering major oem and aftermarket accounts account managers and sales engineers are expected to be familiar with the personnel organization and needs of specific customers to achieve total bookings and new business goals at each account and together with the business unit managers to determine when additional resources are required at customer locations most of our sales personnel are evaluated in part on their bookings and their ability to identify and obtain new business opportunities 

though typically performed by employees the account manager function may be performed by independent representatives depending on the specific customer product and geographic location we also use a number of distributors to provide logistical support as well as serve as a primary customer contact with certain smaller accounts our major distributors are aviall inc a subsidiary of the boeing company and satair as a subsidiary of airbus sas 

manufacturing and engineering 

we maintain approximately 60 principal manufacturing facilities most of our manufacturing facilities are comprised of manufacturing distribution and engineering functions and most facilities have certain administrative functions including 

management sales and finance we continually strive to improve productivity and reduce costs including rationalization of operations developing improved control systems that allow for accurate accounting and reporting investing in equipment tooling information systems and implementing broadbased employee training programs management believes that our manufacturing systems and equipment contribute to our ability to compete by permitting us to meet the rigorous tolerances and cost sensitive price structure of aircraft component customers 

we attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by producing uniquely engineered products with high quality and timely delivery our engineering costs are recorded in cost of sales and in selling and administrative expenses and research and development costs are recorded in selling and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income the aggregate of engineering expense and research and development expense represents approximately 8 of our operating units’ aggregate costs or approximately 4 of our consolidated net sales our proprietary products and particularly our new product initiatives are designed by our engineers and are intended to serve the needs of the aircraft component industry these proprietary designs must withstand the extraordinary conditions and stresses that will be endured by products during use and meet the rigorous demands of our customers’ tolerance and quality requirements 

we use sophisticated equipment and procedures to comply with quality requirements specifications and federal aviation administration “faa” and oem requirements we perform a variety of testing procedures as required by our customers such as testing under different temperature humidity and altitude levels shock and vibration testing and xray fluorescent measurement these procedures together with other customer approved techniques for document process and quality control are used throughout our manufacturing facilities refer to note 3 “summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements included herein with respect to total costs of research and development which is incorporated herein by reference 

customers 

we predominantly serve customers in the commercial regional business jet and general aviation aftermarket which accounts for approximately 35 of total sales the commercial aerospace oem market comprising large commercial transport manufacturers and regional and business jet manufacturers which accounts for approximately 26 of total sales and the defense market which accounts for approximately 34 of total sales nonaerospace sales comprise approximately 5 of our total sales 

our customers include 1 distributors of aerospace components 2 worldwide commercial airlines including national and regional airlines 3 large commercial transport and regional and business aircraft oems 4 various armed forces of the united states and friendly foreign governments 5 defense oems 6 system suppliers and 7 various other industrial customers for the year ended september 30 2017  airbus sas which includes satair as a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world accounted for approximately 13 of our net sales and the boeing company which includes aviall inc also a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world accounted for approximately 11 of our net sales our top ten customers for fiscal year 2017  accounted for approximately 46 of our net sales products supplied to many of our customers are used on multiple platforms 

active commercial production programs include the boeing 737 including the 737max 747 767 and 787 the airbus a320 family including neo a330 a350 and a380 the bombardier cseries crj’s q400dash8 aircraft challenger and learjets the embraer regional and business jets the cessna citation family the gulfstream aircraft family the dassault aircraft family the hondajet and the atr4272 turboprop military platforms include aircraft such as the boeing ah64 apache ch47 c17 chinook f15 f18 kc46 tanker p8 and v22 the airbus a400m the lockheed martin c130j f16 and f35 joint strike fighter uh60 blackhawk helicopter the northrop grumman e2c hawkeye the general atomics predator drone and the raytheon patriot missile we have been awarded numerous contracts for the development of engineered products for production on the airbus a330neo the boeing 777x the bombardier global 70008000 the embraer e2 the mitsubishi regional jet and the sikorsky s97 and jmr helicopter 

the markets in which we sell our products are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced upswings and downturns the demand for our commercial aftermarket parts and services depends on among other things the breadth of our installed oem base revenue passenger miles “rpms” the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet the percentage of the worldwide fleet that is in warranty and airline profitability the demand for defense products is specifically dependent on government budget trends military campaigns and political pressures 

competition 

the niche markets within the aerospace industry that we serve are relatively fragmented and we face several competitors for many of the products and services we provide due to the global nature of the commercial aircraft industry competition in these categories comes from both us and foreign companies competitors in our product offerings range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privatelyheld entities with only one or two components in their entire product portfolios 

we compete on the basis of engineering manufacturing and marketing high quality products which we believe meet or exceed the performance and maintenance requirements of our customers consistent and timely delivery and superior customer service and support the industry’s stringent regulatory certification and technical requirements and the investments necessary 

in the development and certification of products may create disincentives for potential new competitors for certain products if customers receive products that meet or exceed expectations and performance standards we believe that they will have a reduced incentive to certify another supplier because of the cost and time of the technical design and testing certification process in addition we believe that the availability dependability and safety of our products are reasons for our customers to continue longterm supplier relationships 

government contracts 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 1 suspend us from receiving new contracts and impose criminal penalties based on alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations 2 terminate existing contracts 3 reduce the value of existing contracts 4 audit our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs 5 control and potentially prohibit the export of our products and 6 seek repayment of contract related payments under certain circumstances 

governmental regulation 

the commercial aircraft component industry is highly regulated by the faa in the united states and by the joint aviation authorities in europe and other agencies throughout the world while the military aircraft component industry is governed by military quality specifications we and the components we manufacture are required to be certified by one or more of these entities or agencies and in many cases by individual oems in order to engineer and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models 

we must also satisfy the requirements of our customers including oems and airlines that are subject to faa regulations and provide these customers with products and services that comply with the government regulations applicable to commercial flight operations in addition the faa requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components we believe that we currently satisfy or exceed these maintenance standards in our repair and overhaul services we also maintain several faa approved repair stations 

in addition our businesses are subject to many other laws and requirements typically applicable to manufacturers and exporters without limiting the foregoing sales of many of our products that will be used on aircraft owned by foreign entities are subject to compliance with export control laws and the manufacture of our products and the operations of our businesses including the disposal of hazardous wastes are subject to compliance with applicable environmental laws 

market channels 

the commercial aerospace industry including the aftermarket and oem market is impacted by the health of the global economy and geopolitical events around the world the commercial aerospace industry had shown strength with increases in revenue passenger miles or rpms between 2003 and 2008 as well as increases in oem production and backlog however in 2009 the global economic downturn negatively impacted the commercial aerospace industry causing rpms to decline slightly this market sector began to rebound in 2010 and positive growth has continued through 2017 with increases in rpms as well as the growth in the large commercial oem sector aircraft with 100 or more seats with order announcements by the boeing company and airbus sas leading to planned increases in production the 2018 leading indicators and industry consensus suggest a continuation of current trends in the commercial transport market sector supported by continued rpm growth and increases in production at the oem level 

the defense aerospace market is dependent on government budget constraints the timing of orders political pressures and the extent of global conflicts it is not necessarily affected by general economic conditions that affect the commercial aerospace industry 

our presence in both the commercial aerospace and military sectors of the aerospace industry may mitigate the impact on our business of any specific industry risk we service a diversified customer base in the commercial and military aerospace industry and we provide components to a diverse installed base of aircraft which mitigates our exposure to any individual airframe platform at times declines in sales in one channel have been offset by increased sales in another however due to differences between the profitability of our products sold to oem and aftermarket customers variation in product mix can cause variation in gross margin 

there are many shortterm factors including inventory corrections unannounced changes in order patterns strikes and mergers and acquisitions that can cause shortterm disruptions in our quarterly shipment patterns as compared to previous quarters and the same periods in prior years as such it can be difficult to determine longerterm trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons to normalize for shortterm fluctuations we tend to look at our performance over several quarters or years of activity rather than discrete shortterm periods 

there are also fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering and delivery requests from quartertoquarter as well as variations in product mix from quartertoquarter that may cause positive or negative variations in gross profit margins since 

commercial aftermarket sales have historically produced a higher gross margin than sales to commercial oems again in many instances these are timing events between quarters and must be balanced with macro aerospace industry indicators 

commercial aftermarket 

the key growth factors in the commercial aftermarket include worldwide rpms and the size and activity level of the worldwide fleet of aircraft and the percentage of the fleet that is in warranty 

commercial oem market 

the commercial transport market sector the largest sector in the commercial oem market grew modestly during 2017 our commercial transport oem shipments and revenues generally run ahead of the boeing and airbus airframe delivery schedules as a result and consistent with prior years our fiscal 2018 shipments will be a function of among other things the estimated 2018 and 2019 commercial airframe production rates we have been experiencing increased sales in the large commercial oem sector aircraft with 100 or more seats driven by an increase in production by the boeing company and airbus sas tied to previous order announcements industry consensus indicates this production increase will continue in 2018 and 2019 though the growth may continue to moderate and begin to flatten 

defense 

our military business fluctuates from year to year and is dependent to a degree on government budget constraints the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts for a variety of reasons the military spending outlook is very uncertain for planning purposes we assume that military related sales of our types of products to be flat in future years over the recent high levels 

raw materials 

we require the use of various raw materials in our manufacturing processes we also purchase a variety of manufactured component parts from various suppliers at times we concentrate our orders among a few suppliers in order to strengthen our supplier relationships most of our raw materials and component parts are generally available from multiple suppliers at competitive prices 

intellectual property 

we have various trade secrets proprietary information trademarks trade names patents copyrights and other intellectual property rights which we believe in the aggregate but not individually are important to our business 

backlog 

as of september 30 2017  the company estimated its sales order backlog at 1669 million compared to an estimated sales order backlog of 1554 million as of september 30 2016  the increase in estimated sales order backlog is primarily due to acquisitions the majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of september 30 2017  are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months purchase orders may be subject to cancellation or deferral by the customer prior to shipment the level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of the company’s receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled accordingly the company’s backlog as of september 30 2017  may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period 

foreign operations 

although we manufacture a significant portion of our products in the united states we manufacture some products in belgium china germany hungary malaysia mexico norway sri lanka sweden and the united kingdom although the majority of sales of our products are made to customers including distributors located in the united states our products are ultimately sold to and used by customers including airlines and other end users of aircraft throughout the world a number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including currency fluctuations difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies restrictions on the repatriation of funds change in trade policies tariff regulation difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition 

environmental matters 

our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things discharges of pollutants into the air and water the generation handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees environmental laws and regulations may require that the company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations certain facilities and thirdparty sites utilized by the company have been identified 

as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws the company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws 

employees 

as of september 30 2017  we had approximately 9200 fulltime parttime and temporary employees approximately 11 of our fulltime and parttime employees were represented by labor unions collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire at various dates ranging from february 2018 to november 2020 we consider our relationship with our employees generally to be satisfactory

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below are important risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business and financial condition and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

our commercial business is sensitive to the number of flight hours that our customers’ planes spend aloft the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and our customers’ profitability these items are in turn affected by general economic and geopolitical and other worldwide conditions 

our commercial business is directly affected by among other factors changes in revenue passenger miles rpms the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet the percentage of the fleet that is outofwarranty and changes in the profitability of the commercial airline industry rpms and airline profitability have historically been correlated with the general economic environment although national and international events also play a key role for example in the past the airline industry has been severely affected by the downturn in the global economy higher fuel prices the increased security concerns among airline customers following the events of september 11 2001 the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic and the conflicts abroad and could be impacted by future geopolitical or other worldwide events such as war terrorist acts or a worldwide infectious disease outbreak in addition global market and economic conditions have been challenging with turbulence in the us and international markets and economies and have prolonged declines in business and consumer spending as a result of the substantial reduction in airline traffic resulting from these events the airline industry incurred large losses and financial difficulties some carriers have also parked or retired a portion of their fleets and have reduced workforces and flights during periods of reduced airline profitability some airlines may delay purchases of spare parts preferring instead to deplete existing inventories and delay refurbishments and discretionary spending if demand for spare parts decreases there would be a decrease in demand for certain of our products an adverse change in demand could impact our results of operations collection of accounts receivable and our expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses which may adversely impact our financial condition and access to capital markets 

our sales to manufacturers of aircraft are cyclical and a downturn in sales to these manufacturers may adversely affect us 

our sales to manufacturers of large commercial aircraft such as the boeing company airbus sas and related oem suppliers as well as manufacturers of business jets which collectively accounted for approximately 25 of our net sales in fiscal year 2017  have historically experienced periodic downturns in the past these sales have been affected by airline profitability which is impacted by among other things fuel and labor costs price competition interest rates downturns in the global economy and national and international events in addition sales of our products to manufacturers of business jets are impacted by among other things downturns in the global economy downturns adversely affect our net sales gross margin and net income 

we rely heavily on certain customers for much of our sales 

our two largest customers for fiscal year 2017  were airbus sas which includes satair as and the boeing company which includes aviall inc airbus sas accounted for approximately13 of our net sales and the boeing company accounted for approximately 11 of our net sales in fiscal year 2017  our top ten customers for fiscal year 2017  accounted for approximately 46 of our net sales a material reduction in purchasing by one of our larger customers for any reason including but not limited to economic downturn decreased production strike or resourcing could have a material adverse effect on our net sales gross margin and net income 

we generally do not have guaranteed future sales of our products further when we enter into fixed price contracts with some of our customers we take the risk for cost overruns 

as is customary in our business we do not generally have longterm contracts with most of our aftermarket customers and therefore do not have guaranteed future sales although we have longterm contracts with many of our oem customers many of those customers may terminate the contracts on short notice and in most cases our customers have not committed to buy any minimum quantity of our products in addition in certain cases we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon the historic purchasing patterns of customers and upon our discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements and this anticipated future volume of orders may not materialize 

we also have entered into multiyear fixedprice contracts with some of our customers pursuant to which we have agreed to perform the work for a fixed price and accordingly realize all the benefit or detriment resulting from any decreases or increases in the costs of making these products sometimes we accept a fixedprice contract for a product that we have not yet produced and this increases the risk of cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product most of our contracts do not permit us to recover increases in raw material prices taxes or labor costs 

us military spending is dependent upon the us defense budget 

the military and defense market is significantly dependent upon government budget trends particularly the us department of defense the “dod” budget in addition to normal business risks our supply of products to the united states government is subject to unique risks largely beyond our control dod budgets could be negatively impacted by several factors including but not limited to a change in defense spending policy by the current presidential administration the us government’s budget deficits spending priorities the cost of sustaining the us military presence internationally and possible political pressure to reduce us government military spending each of which could cause the dod budget to remain unchanged or to decline a significant decline in us military expenditures could result in a reduction in the amount of our products sold to the various agencies and buying organizations of the us government 

we intend to pursue acquisitions our business may be adversely affected if we cannot consummate acquisitions on satisfactory terms or if we cannot effectively integrate acquired operations 

a significant portion of our growth has occurred through acquisitions any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions we intend to pursue acquisitions that we believe will present opportunities consistent with our overall business strategy however we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates to purchase or may be unable to acquire desired businesses or assets on economically acceptable terms or may be unable to receive necessary regulatory approvals or support in addition we may not be able to raise the capital necessary to fund future acquisitions because we may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously we may encounter unforeseen expenses complications and delays including regulatory complications or difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight 

we regularly engage in discussions with respect to potential acquisition and investment opportunities if we consummate an acquisition our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly future acquisitions could result in margin dilution and further likely result in the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest and amortization expenses or periodic impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets as well as significant charges relating to integration costs 

acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect in addition we may not be able to successfully integrate any business we acquire into our existing business the successful integration of new businesses depends on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs the successful integration of future acquisitions may also require substantial attention from our senior management and the management of the acquired business which could decrease the time that they have to service attract customers and develop new products and services or attend to other acquisition opportunities 

we are subject to certain unique business risks as a result of supplying equipment and services to the us government 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 



most of our us government contracts can be terminated by the us government for its convenience without significant notice termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination 

on contracts for which the price is based on cost the us government may review our costs and performance as well as our accounting and general business practices based on the results of such audits the us government may adjust our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs in addition under us government purchasing regulations some of our costs including most financing costs amortization of intangible assets portions of research and development costs and certain marketing expenses may not be subject to reimbursement 

furthermore even where the price is not based on cost the us government may seek to review our costs to determine whether our pricing is “fair and reasonable” our subsidiaries are periodically subject to a pricing review and in fact government buying agencies that purchase some of our subsidiaries’ products are currently the subject of a dod office of inspector general audit with respect to prices paid for such products pricing reviews and government audits including the one underway could be costly and time consuming for our management and could distract from our ability to effectively manage the business as a result of such a review we could be subject to providing a refund to the us government or we could be asked to enter into an arrangement whereby our prices would be based on cost or the dod could seek to pursue alternative sources of supply for our parts any of those occurrences could lead to a reduction in our revenue from or the profitability of certain of our supply arrangements with certain agencies and buying organizations of the us government 

moreover us government purchasing regulations contain a number of additional operation requirements which do not apply to entities not engaged in government contracting failure to comply with such government contracting requirements could result in civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

our business may be adversely affected if we would lose our government or industry approvals or if more stringent government regulations are enacted or if industry oversight is increased 

the aerospace industry is highly regulated in the united states and in other countries in order to sell our components we and the components we manufacture must be certified by the faa the dod and similar agencies in foreign countries and by individual manufacturers if new and more stringent government regulations are adopted or if industry oversight increases we might incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or heightened industry oversight in addition if material authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended our business would be adversely affected 

in addition to the aviation approvals we are at times required to obtain approval from us government agencies to export our products failure to obtain approval to export or determination by the us government that we failed to receive required approvals or licenses could eliminate or restrict our ability to sell our products outside the united states and the penalties that could be imposed by the us government for failure to comply with these laws could be significant 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and could harm our ability to react to changes to our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of september 30 2017  our total indebtedness excluding approximately 16 million  of letters of credit outstanding was approximately 118 billion  which was 1335  of our total book capitalization as a result of our dividends being funded in part with indebtedness and the addition of approximately 16 billion in net new incremental borrowings during fiscal 2017  

in addition we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future for example as of september 30 2017  we had approximately 584 million  of unused commitments under our revolving loan facility although our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the various senior subordinated notes outstanding the “indentures” contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these qualifications and exceptions could be substantial for example if the usage of the revolving loan facility exceeds 25 of the total revolving commitments the company will be required to maintain a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio of net debt as defined to trailing fourquarter ebitda as defined a breach of any of the covenants or an inability to comply with the required leverage ratio could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the indentures 

our substantial debt could also have other important consequences to investors for example it could 



 in addition all of our debt under the senior secured credit facility which includes 70 billion  in term loans and a revolving loan facility of 600 million bears interest at floating rates accordingly if interest rates increase our debt service expense will also increase interest rate swap and cap agreements are used to manage interest rate risk associated with floatingrate borrowings under our credit facilities for information about our interest rate swap and cap agreements see note 20 “derivatives and hedging instruments” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness including the indentures we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital 

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness including the indentures amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility amounts due under our securitization facility and to fund our operations will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future which to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness including the amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility amounts borrowed under our securitization facility and the indentures or to fund our other liquidity needs if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital we cannot assure that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations the terms of existing or future debt instruments the securitization facility the indentures and the senior secured credit facility may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives in addition any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms and would otherwise adversely affect the indentures 

the terms of the senior secured credit facility and indentures may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

our senior secured credit facility and the indentures contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indentures and may limit their ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests the senior secured credit facility and indentures include covenants restricting among other things the ability of td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indentures to 



 a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the indentures if any such default occurs the lenders under the senior secured credit facility and the holders of the senior subordinated notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder to be immediately due and payable the lenders under the senior secured credit facility also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings in addition following an event of default under the senior secured credit facility the lenders under that facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which includes our available cash and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the senior subordinated notes if the debt under the senior secured credit facility or the senior subordinated notes were to be accelerated we cannot assure that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations 

our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things discharges of pollutants into the air and water the generation handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees environmental laws and regulations may require that the company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations certain facilities and thirdparty sites utilized by subsidiaries of the company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws the company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws 

estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are based on current facts laws regulations and technology these estimates take into consideration the company’s prior experience and professional judgment of the company’s environmental advisors estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination the range of remediation alternatives available evolving remediation standards imprecise engineering evaluations and cost estimates the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 

accordingly as investigation and remediation proceed it is likely that adjustments in the company’s accruals will be necessary to reflect new information the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in a given period based on currently available information however the company does not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition 

we are dependent on our senior management team and highly trained employees and any work stoppage or difficulty hiring similar employees could adversely affect our business 

because our products are complicated and highly engineered we depend on an educated and trained workforce there is substantial competition for skilled personnel in the aircraft component industry and we could be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled employees we may not be able to fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover or attract and retain qualified personnel 

although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory we cannot assure that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory renewal of collective bargaining agreements or that our employee relations will remain stable because we maintain a relatively small inventory of finished goods any work stoppage could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide products to our customers 

          in addition our success depends in part on our ability to attract and motivate our senior management and key employees achieving this objective may be difficult due to a variety of factors including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions competitors’ hiring practices and the effectiveness of our compensation programs competition for qualified personnel can be intense a loss of senior management and key personnel or failure to attract qualified new talent could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and our operating results andor market value could be adversely affected  the board continually monitors this risk and we believe that the board’s succession plan together with our straightforward strategy clear value drivers decentralized nature and the quality of managers running our operating units helps to mitigate this risk 

our business is dependent on the availability of certain components and raw materials from suppliers 

our business is affected by the price and availability of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our components our business therefore could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our suppliers such as the destruction of our suppliers’ facilities or their distribution infrastructure a work stoppage or strike by our suppliers’ employees or the failure 

of our suppliers to provide materials of the requisite quality or by increased costs of such raw materials or components if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers because we maintain a relatively small inventory of raw materials and component parts our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers or alternative raw materials or component parts the lengthy and expensive faa and oem certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier raw material or component part 

our operations depend on our manufacturing facilities which are subject to physical and other risks that could disrupt production 

a number of our manufacturing facilities are located in the greater los angeles area an area known for earthquakes and are thus vulnerable to damage in addition a number of our manufacturing facilities are located along the eastern seaboard area susceptible to hurricanes we are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters including power loss fire explosions floods communications failures terrorist attacks and similar events disruptions could also occur due to cyberattacks computer or equipment malfunction accidental or intentional operator error or process failures any disruption of our ability to operate our business could result in a material decrease in our revenues or significant additional costs to replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

operations and sales outside of the united states may be subject to additional risks 

a number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including currency fluctuations difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies restrictions on the repatriation of funds change in trade policies tariff regulation difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition furthermore the company is subject to laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act uk bribery act and similar local antibribery laws which generally prohibit companies and their employees agents and contractors from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure to comply with these laws could subject the company to civil and criminal penalties that could materially adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

we face significant competition 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry and compete against a number of companies competitors in our product lines are both us and foreign companies and range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privately held entities we believe that our ability to compete depends on high product performance consistent high quality short leadtime and timely delivery competitive pricing superior customer service and support and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs we may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive 

we could be adversely affected if one of our components causes an aircraft to crash 

our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we have designed manufactured or serviced while we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future product liability claims in the event of product liability claims our insurers may attempt to deny coverage or any coverage we have may not be adequate we also may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost any liability not covered by insurance or for which third party indemnification is not available could result in significant liability to us 

in addition a crash caused by one of our components could damage our reputation for quality products we believe our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting a provider of aircraft components if a crash were to be caused by one of our components or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of data protection concerns 

the interpretation and application of data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are uncertain and evolving it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices compliance could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

in addition despite our efforts to protect confidential information our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to data loss including cyberattacks this could lead to negative publicity legal claims theft modification or destruction of proprietary or key information damage to or inaccessibility of critical systems manufacture of defective products production downtimes operational disruptions and other significant costs which could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and results of operations 

we have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets which may never generate the returns we expect 

mergers and acquisitions have resulted in significant increases in identifiable intangible assets and goodwill identifiable intangible assets which primarily include trademarks trade names trade secrets and technology were approximately 17 billion  at september 30 2017  representing approximately 17  of our total assets goodwill recognized in accounting for the mergers and acquisitions was approximately 57 billion  at september 30 2017  representing approximately 58  of our total assets we may never realize the full value of our identifiable intangible assets and goodwill and to the extent we were to determine that our identifiable intangible assets or our goodwill were impaired within the meaning of applicable accounting standards we would be required to writeoff the amount of any impairment 

the company may be subject to risks relating to changes in its tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities 

          the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and various nonus jurisdictions the company’s domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions the company’s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the company’s effective tax rate as a result of changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets challenges by tax authorities or changes in tax laws or regulations in addition the amount of income taxes paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company’s tax liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

our stock price may be volatile and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 

         there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities which is unrelated to the operating performance of the companies issuing the securities these market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock shareholders may not be able to sell their shares at or above the purchase price due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock such changes could be caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects including possible changes due to the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry and other factors such as fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering which could cause shortterm swings in profit margins or such changes could be unrelated to our operating performance such as changes in market conditions affecting the stock market generally or the stocks of aerospace companies or changes in the outlook for our common stock such as changes to or the confidence in our business strategy changes to or confidence in our management or expectations for future growth of the company 

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our share price 

we may sell additional shares of common stock into the public markets or issue convertible debt securities to raise capital in the future the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public markets or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities to raise capital at a time and price that we deem appropriate 

our corporate documents and delaware law contain certain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable for example our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 149600000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock without stockholder approval the board of directors has the authority to attach special rights including voting and dividend rights to this preferred stock with these rights holders of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75 of the voting power of our issued and outstanding capital stock voting together as a single class is required for the alteration amendment or repeal of certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and certain provisions of our amended and restated bylaws including the provisions relating to our stockholders’ ability to call special meetings notice provisions for stockholder business to be conducted at an annual meeting requests for stockholder lists and corporate records nomination and removal of directors and filling of vacancies on our board of directors 

we are also subject to the antitakeover provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law under these provisions if anyone becomes an “interested stockholder” we may not enter into a “business combination” with that person for three years without special approval which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change of control for purposes of section 203 “interested stockholder” means generally someone owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years subject to certain exceptions as described in section 203 

we do not regularly declare and pay quarterly or annual cash dividends on our stock

 item 7 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected financial data” and td group’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report the following discussion may contain predictions estimates and other forwardlooking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties including those discussed under the heading entitled “risk factors” included elsewhere in this report these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 

overview 

for fiscal year 2017  we generated net sales of 35043 million  gross profit of 19846 million  or 566  of sales and net income of 5969 million  we believe we have achieved steady longterm growth in sales and improvements in operating performance since our formation in 1993 due to our competitive strengths and through execution of our valuedriven operating strategy more specifically focusing our businesses on our valuedriven operating strategy of obtaining profitable new business carefully controlling the cost structure and pricing our highly engineered valueadded products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so has historically resulted in improvements in gross profit and income from operations over the long term 

our selective acquisition strategy has also contributed to the growth of our business the integration of certain acquisitions into our existing businesses combined with implementing our proven operating strategy has historically resulted in improvements of the financial performance of the acquired business 

we believe our key competitive strengths include 

large and growing installed product base with aftermarket revenue stream  we provide components to a large and growing installed base of aircraft to which we supply aftermarket products we estimate that our products are installed on approximately 95000 commercial transport regional transport military and general aviation fixed wing turbine aircraft and rotary wing aircraft 

diversified revenue base  we believe that our diversified revenue base reduces our dependence on any particular product platform or market channel and has been a significant factor in maintaining our financial performance our products are installed on almost all of the major commercial aircraft platforms now in production we expect to continue to develop new products for military and commercial applications 

barriers to entry  we believe that the niche nature of our markets the industry’s stringent regulatory and certification requirements the large number of products that we sell and the investments necessary to develop and certify products create potential disincentives to competition for certain products 

our business strategy is made up of two key elements 1 a valuedriven operating strategy focused around our three core value drivers and 2 a selective acquisition strategy 

valuedriven operating strategy  our three core value drivers are 

 selective acquisition strategy  we selectively pursue the acquisition of proprietary aerospace component businesses when we see an opportunity to create value through the application of our three core valuedriven operating strategies the aerospace industry in particular remains highly fragmented with many of the companies in the industry being small private businesses or small noncore operations of larger businesses we have significant experience among our management team in executing acquisitions and integrating acquired businesses into our company and culture as of the date of this report we have successfully acquired approximately 60 businesses andor product lines since our formation in 1993 many of these acquisitions have been integrated into an existing transdigm production facility which enables a higher production capacity utilization which in turn improves gross profit levels due to the ability to spread the fixed manufacturing overhead costs over higher production volume 

acquisitions during the previous three fiscal years are more fully described in note 2 “acquisitions” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations however investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 

below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions for additional accounting policies see note 3 “summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

revenue recognition and related allowances  revenue is recognized from the sale of products when title and risk of loss passes to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment substantially all product sales are made pursuant to firm fixedprice purchase orders received from customers collectibility of amounts recorded as revenue is reasonably assured at the time of sale provisions for returns uncollectible accounts and the cost of repairs under contract warranty provisions are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are principally based on historical results modified as appropriate by the most current information available we have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of such allowances however due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process it is possible that actual results may vary from the estimates and the differences could be material 

allowance for doubtful accounts management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable and customer creditworthiness the allowance also incorporates a provision for the estimated impact of disputes with customers management’s estimate of the allowance amounts that are necessary includes amounts for specifically identified credit losses and estimated credit losses based on historical information the determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to significant levels of judgment and estimation by management depending on the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues or if the financial condition of any of the company’s customers were to deteriorate and their ability to make required payments were to become impaired increases in these allowances may be required historically changes in estimates in the allowance for doubtful accounts have not been significant 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost of inventories is generally determined by the average cost and the firstin firstout fifo methods and includes material labor and overhead related to the manufacturing process because the company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be inservice for 25 or more years it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use where management estimated that the current market value was below cost or determined that future demand was lower than current inventory levels based on historical experience current and projected market demand current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value was made by recording a provision included in cost of sales although management believes that the company’s estimates of excess and obsolete inventory are reasonable actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future in addition in accordance with industry practice all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year historically changes in estimates in the net realizable value of inventories have not been significant 

goodwill and other intangible assets  in accordance with asc 805 “business combinations” the company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized as goodwill the valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results in addition to using management estimates and negotiated amounts the company used a variety of information sources to determine the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including thirdparty appraisals for the estimated value and lives of identifiable intangible assets   fair value adjustments to the company’s assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition  

intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights or if the intangible asset can be sold transferred licensed or exchanged regardless of the company’s intent to do so goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition and are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates 

gaap requires that the annual and any interim impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level the reporting unit level is one level below an operating segment substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each reporting 

unit pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction with respect to acquisitions integrated into an existing reporting unit any acquired goodwill is combined with the goodwill of the reporting unit 

at the time of goodwill impairment testing the company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test the quantitative test is required only if the company concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount or if the company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit for the quantitative test management determines the estimated fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit if the calculated estimated fair value is less than the current carrying value impairment of goodwill of the reporting unit may exist the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing includes discount rates growth rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates are set by using the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” methodology the wacc methodology considers market and industry data as well as company specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business 

management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates as an indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately through the use of the discounted cash flow valuation model the aggregate of all reporting unit’s estimated fair value is reconciled to the total market capitalization of the company 

the company had 34 reporting units with goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 the date of the last annual impairment test the estimated fair values of each of the reporting units was substantially in excess of their respective carrying values and therefore no goodwill impairment was recorded the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate which is a significant assumption in the calculation of fair values with a one percentage point increase in the discount rate nearly all of the reporting units would continue to have fair values substantially in excess of their respective carrying values 

management tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at the asset level as determined by appropriate asset valuation at the time of acquisition the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets consists of a comparison between the estimated fair values and carrying values if the carrying amounts of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives exceed their estimated fair values an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference management utilizes the royalty savings valuation method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset in this method management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset the key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates royalty rates growth rates sales projections and terminal value rates discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the wacc methodology considering any differences in companyspecific risk factors between reporting units and the indefinitelived intangible assets royalty rates are established by management with the advice of valuation experts and periodically substantiated by valuation experts management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant intangible asset terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates 

the discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed actual results could differ from these assumptions management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering the current economic conditions 

stockbased compensation  the cost of the company’s stockbased compensation is recorded in accordance with asc 718 “stock compensation” the company uses a blackscholesmerton option pricing model to estimate the grantdate fair value of the stock options awarded the blackscholesmerton model requires assumptions regarding the expected volatility of the company’s common shares the riskfree interest rate the expected life of the stock options award and the company’s dividend yield the company utilizes historical data in determining these assumptions an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside of management’s control could have an impact on the blackscholesmerton model 

income taxes  the company estimates income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates this involves estimating taxable earnings specific taxable and deductible items the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits to the extent these estimates change adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes are made in the period in which the changes occur historically such adjustments have not been significant 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain operating data of the company including presentation of the amounts as a percentage of net sales amounts in thousands 



fiscal year ended september 30 2017  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2016

acquisition sales represent sales of acquired businesses for the period up to one year subsequent to their acquisition date the amount of acquisition sales shown in the table above was attributable to the third quarter 2017 acquisitions in fiscal year 2017 and the acquisitions of yftactair ddc and breezeeastern in fiscal year 2016 

the increase in organic sales was primarily driven by commercial aftermarket organic sales increasing by 348 million  or 30  and defense organic sales increasing by 415 million  or 44  slightly offsetting the increases was commercial oem organic sales decreasing by 28 million  or 03  

cost of sales and gross profit  cost of sales increased by 764 million  or 53  to 15197 million  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2017  compared to 14433 million  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2016  cost of sales and the related percentage of total sales for the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  and 2016  were as follows amounts in millions 



the increase in the dollar amount of cost of sales during the fiscal year ended september 30 2017  was primarily due to increased volume associated with the sales from acquisitions and organic sales growth 

gross profit as a percentage of sales increased by 21  percentage points to 566  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2017  from 545  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2016  the dollar amount of gross profit increased by 2565 million  or 148  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2017  compared to the comparable period last year due to the following items

the increase in the dollar amount of selling and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended september 30 2017  is primarily due to higher selling and administrative expenses relating to recent acquisitions of approximately 477 million which was approximately 19 of acquisition sales the increase is partially offset by lower acquisitionrelated and stock compensation expenses of 195 million  and 14 million  respectively 

amortization of intangible assets  amortization of intangible assets increased to 892 million  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2017  from 774 million  for the comparable period last year the net increase of 118 million  was primarily due to the third quarter 2017 acquisitions and full year amortization recorded from the fiscal 2016 acquisitions of breezeeastern ddc and yftactair 

refinancing costs  refinancing costs of 398 million  were recorded during the year ended september 30 2017  representing debt issuance costs expensed in connection with the debt financing activity as disclosed in note 11 debt to the consolidated financial statements included within the 398 million  was approximately 319 million   in debt issuance costs and premium related to the repurchase of the 2021 notes  refinancing costs of 158 million  were recorded during the fiscal year ended september 30 2016  representing debt issuance costs expensed in connection with the debt financing activity in june 2016

foreign operations 

our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately 13189 million  11695 million  and 8811 million  for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks including foreign currency fluctuations the impact of foreign government regulations political uncertainties and differences in business practices there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments’ countries furthermore there can be no assurance that the political cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 

inflation 

many of the company’s raw materials and operating expenses are sensitive to the effects of inflation which could result in changing operating costs the effects of inflation on the company’s businesses during the fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  were immaterial 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically maintained a capital structure comprising a mix of equity and debt financing we vary our leverage both to optimize our equity return and to pursue acquisitions we expect to meet our current debt obligations as they come due through internally generated funds from current levels of operations andor through refinancing in the debt markets prior to the maturity dates of our debt 

we continually evaluate our debt facilities to assess whether they most efficiently and effectively meet the current and future needs of our business the company evaluates from time to time the appropriateness of its current leverage taking into consideration the company’s debt holders equity holders credit ratings acquisition opportunities and other factors the company’s debt leverage ratio which is computed as total debt divided by ebitda as defined for the applicable twelvemonth period has varied widely during the company’s history ranging from approximately 35 to 72 our debt leverage ratio at september 30 2017  was approximately 69  

if the company has excess cash it generally prioritizes allocating the excess cash in the following manner 1 capital spending at existing businesses 2 acquisitions of businesses 3 payment of a special dividend andor repurchases of our common stock and 4 prepayment of indebtedness or repurchase of debt whether the company undertakes additional common stock repurchases or other aforementioned activities will depend on prevailing market conditions the company’s liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material in addition the company may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so 

the company’s ability to make scheduled interest payments on or to refinance the company’s indebtedness or to fund nonacquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on the company’s ability to generate cash in the future this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control 

as a result of the additional debt financing during the fiscal year ended september 30 2017 interest payments will increase going forward in accordance with the terms of the related debt agreements however in connection with the continued application of our three core valuedriven operating strategies obtaining profitable new business continually improving our cost structure and providing highly engineered valueadded products to customers we expect our efforts will continue to generate strong margins and provide more than sufficient cash from operating activities to meet our interest obligations and liquidity needs we believe our cash from operations and available borrowing capacity will enable us to make opportunistic investments in our own stock make strategic business combinations andor pay dividends to our shareholders 

in the future the company may increase its borrowings in connection with acquisitions if cash flow from operating activities becomes insufficient to fund current operations or for other shortterm cash needs or for stock repurchases or dividends our future leverage will also be impacted by the then current conditions of the credit markets

 item 1 business 

the company 

transdigm inc was formed in 1993 in connection with a leveraged buyout transaction td group was formed in 2003 to facilitate a leveraged buyout of transdigm inc the company was owned by private equity funds until its initial public offering in 2006 td group’s common stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange or nyse under the ticker symbol “tdg” 

we believe we are a leading global designer producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers we estimate that about 90 of our net sales for fiscal year 2016 were generated by proprietary products in addition for fiscal year 2016 we estimate that we generated about 80 of our net sales from products for which we are the sole source provider 

most of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue once our parts are designed into and sold on a new aircraft we generate net sales from aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft which is generally estimated to be approximately 25 to 30 years a typical platform can be produced for 20 to 30 years giving us an estimated product life cycle in excess of 50 years we estimate that approximately 54 of our net sales in fiscal year 2016  were generated from aftermarket sales the vast majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets these aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and been more stable than sales to original equipment manufacturers or oems 

products 

we primarily design produce and supply highly engineered proprietary aerospace components and certain systemssubsystems with significant aftermarket content we seek to develop highly customized products to solve specific needs for aircraft operators and manufacturers we attempt to differentiate ourselves based on engineering service and manufacturing capabilities we typically choose not to compete for nonproprietary “build to print” business because it frequently offers lower 

margins than proprietary products we believe that our products have strong brand names within the industry and that we have a reputation for high quality reliability and customer support 

our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products that we offer to our customers some of our more significant product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and engine technology specialized pumps and valves power conditioning devices specialized acdc electric motors and generators nicad batteries and chargers engineered latching and locking devices rods and locking devices engineered connectors and elastomers databus and power controls cockpit security components and systems specialized cockpit displays aircraft audio systems specialized lavatory components seat belts and safety restraints engineered interior surfaces and related components lighting and control technology military personnel parachutes high performance hoists winches and lifting devices and cargo loading handling and delivery systems 

segments 

the company’s businesses are organized and managed in three reporting segments power  control airframe and nonaviation 

the power  control segment includes operations that primarily develop produce and market systems and components that predominately provide power to or control power of the aircraft utilizing electronic fluid power and mechanical motion control technologies major product offerings include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and engine technology specialized pumps and valves power conditioning devices specialized acdc electric motors and generators databus and power controls high performance hoists winches and lifting devices and cargo loading and handling systems primary customers of this segment are engine and power system and subsystem suppliers airlines third party maintenance suppliers military buying agencies and repair depots products are sold in the oem and aftermarket market channels 

the airframe segment includes operations that primarily develop produce and market systems and components that are used in nonpower airframe applications utilizing airframe and cabin structure technologies major product offerings include engineered latching and locking devices rods and locking devices engineered connectors and elastomers cockpit security components and systems aircraft audio systems specialized lavatory components seat belts and safety restraints engineered interior surfaces and related components lighting and control technology military personnel parachutes and cargo delivery systems primary customers of this segment are airframe manufacturers and cabin system suppliers and subsystem suppliers airlines third party maintenance suppliers military buying agencies and repair depots products are sold in the oem and aftermarket market channels 

the nonaviation segment includes operations that primarily develop produce and market products for nonaviation markets major product offerings include seat belts and safety restraints for ground transportation applications mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls for space applications and refueling systems for heavy equipment used in mining construction and other industries primary customers of this segment are offroad vehicle suppliers and subsystem suppliers child restraint system suppliers satellite and space system suppliers and manufacturers of heavy equipment used in mining construction and other industries 

for financial information about our segments see note 16 “segments” to our consolidated financial statements included herein 

sales and marketing 

consistent with our overall strategy our sales and marketing organization is structured to continually develop technical solutions that meet customer needs in particular we attempt to focus on products and programs that will lead to highmargin repeatable sales in the aftermarket 

we have structured our sales efforts along our major product offerings assigning a business unit manager to certain products each business unit manager is expected to grow the sales and profitability of the products for which he or she is responsible and to achieve the targeted annual level of bookings sales new business and profitability for such products the business unit managers are assisted by account managers and sales engineers who are responsible for covering major oem and aftermarket accounts account managers and sales engineers are expected to be familiar with the personnel organization and needs of specific customers to achieve total bookings and new business goals at each account and together with the business unit managers to determine when additional resources are required at customer locations most of our sales personnel are evaluated in part on their bookings and their ability to identify and obtain new business opportunities 

though typically performed by employees the account manager function may be performed by independent representatives depending on the specific customer product and geographic location we also use a number of distributors to 

provide logistical support as well as serve as a primary customer contact with certain smaller accounts our major distributors are aviall inc a subsidiary of the boeing company and satair as a subsidiary of airbus sas 

manufacturing and engineering 

we maintain 57 principal manufacturing facilities most of our manufacturing facilities are comprised of manufacturing distribution and engineering functions and most facilities have certain administrative functions including management sales and finance we continually strive to improve productivity and reduce costs including rationalization of operations developing improved control systems that allow for accurate accounting and reporting investing in equipment tooling information systems and implementing broadbased employee training programs management believes that our manufacturing systems and equipment contribute to our ability to compete by permitting us to meet the rigorous tolerances and cost sensitive price structure of aircraft component customers 

we attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by producing uniquely engineered products with high quality and timely delivery our engineering costs are recorded in cost of sales and in selling and administrative expenses and research and development costs are recorded in selling and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income the aggregate of engineering expense and research and development expense represents approximately 7 of our operating units’ aggregate costs or approximately 4 of our consolidated net sales our proprietary products and particularly our new product initiatives are designed by our engineers and are intended to serve the needs of the aircraft component industry these proprietary designs must withstand the extraordinary conditions and stresses that will be endured by products during use and meet the rigorous demands of our customers’ tolerance and quality requirements 

we use sophisticated equipment and procedures to comply with quality requirements specifications and federal aviation administration “faa” and oem requirements we perform a variety of testing procedures as required by our customers such as testing under different temperature humidity and altitude levels shock and vibration testing and xray fluorescent measurement these procedures together with other customer approved techniques for document process and quality control are used throughout our manufacturing facilities refer to note 3 “summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements included herein with respect to total costs of research and development which is incorporated herein by reference 

customers 

we predominantly serve customers in the commercial regional business jet and general aviation aftermarket which accounts for approximately 37 of total sales the commercial aerospace oem market comprising large commercial transport manufacturers and regional and business jet manufacturers which accounts for approximately 29 of total sales and the defense market which accounts for approximately 30 of total sales nonaerospace sales comprise approximately 4 of our total sales 

our customers include 1 distributors of aerospace components 2 worldwide commercial airlines including national and regional airlines 3 large commercial transport and regional and business aircraft oems 4 various armed forces of the united states and friendly foreign governments 5 defense oems 6 system suppliers and 7 various other industrial customers for the year ended september 30 2016  airbus sas which includes satair as a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world accounted for approximately 13 of our net sales and the boeing company which includes aviall inc also a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world accounted for approximately 12 of our net sales our top ten customers for fiscal year 2016  accounted for approximately 45 of our net sales products supplied to many of our customers are used on multiple platforms 

active commercial production programs include the boeing 737 747 767 777 and 787 the airbus a318192021 including neo a330a340 a350 and a380 the bombardier crj’s challenger and learjets the embraer rj’s the cessna citation family the raytheon premier and hawker and most gulfstream airframes military platforms include aircraft such as the boeing c17 f15 f18 p8 and v22 the airbus a400m the lockheed martin c130j f16 and f35 joint strikefighter the northrop grumman e2c hawkeye the sikorsky uh60 helicopter ch47 chinook and ah64 apache helicopters the general atomics predator drone and the raytheon patriot missile transdigm has been awarded numerous contracts for the development of engineered products for production on the airbus a330neo the boeing 737 max and 777x the embraer 175190195 e2 the sikorsky s97 and jmr helicopter 

the markets in which we sell our products are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced upswings and downturns the demand for our commercial aftermarket parts and services depends on among other things the breadth of our installed oem base revenue passenger miles “rpms” the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and to a lesser extent airline profitability the demand for defense products is specifically dependent on government budget trends military campaigns and political pressures 

competition 

the niche markets within the aerospace industry that we serve are relatively fragmented and we face several competitors for many of the products and services we provide due to the global nature of the commercial aircraft industry competition in these categories comes from both us and foreign companies competitors in our product offerings range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privatelyheld entities with only one or two components in their entire product portfolios 

we compete on the basis of engineering manufacturing and marketing high quality products which we believe meet or exceed the performance and maintenance requirements of our customers consistent and timely delivery and superior customer service and support the industry’s stringent regulatory certification and technical requirements and the investments necessary in the development and certification of products create barriers to entry for potential new competitors as long as customers receive products that meet or exceed expectations and performance standards we believe that they will have a reduced incentive to certify another supplier because of the cost and time of the technical design and testing certification process in addition we believe that the availability dependability and safety of our products are reasons for our customers to continue longterm supplier relationships 

government contracts 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 1 suspend us from receiving new contracts based on alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations 2 terminate existing contracts 3 reduce the value of existing contracts 4 audit our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs and 5 control and potentially prohibit the export of our products 

governmental regulation 

the commercial aircraft component industry is highly regulated by the faa in the united states and by the joint aviation authorities in europe and other agencies throughout the world while the military aircraft component industry is governed by military quality specifications we and the components we manufacture are required to be certified by one or more of these entities or agencies and in many cases by individual oems in order to engineer and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models 

we must also satisfy the requirements of our customers including oems and airlines that are subject to faa regulations and provide these customers with products and services that comply with the government regulations applicable to commercial flight operations in addition the faa requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components we believe that we currently satisfy or exceed these maintenance standards in our repair and overhaul services we also maintain several faa approved repair stations 

in addition our businesses are subject to many other laws and requirements typically applicable to manufacturers and exporters without limiting the foregoing sales of many of our products that will be used on aircraft owned by foreign entities are subject to compliance with export control laws and the manufacture of our products and the operations of our businesses including the disposal of hazardous wastes are subject to compliance with applicable environmental laws 

market channels 

the commercial aerospace industry including the aftermarket and oem market is impacted by the health of the global economy and geopolitical events around the world the commercial aerospace industry had shown strength with increases in revenue passenger miles or rpms between 2003 and 2008 as well as increases in oem production and backlog however in 2009 the global economic downturn negatively impacted the commercial aerospace industry causing rpms to decline slightly this market sector began to rebound in 2010 and positive growth has continued through 2016 with increases in rpms as well as the growth in the large commercial oem sector aircraft with 100 or more seats with order announcements by the boeing company and airbus sas leading to planned increases in production the 2017 leading indicators and industry consensus suggest a continuation of current trends in the commercial transport market sector supported by continued rpm growth and increases in production at the oem level 

the defense aerospace market is dependent on government budget constraints the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts it is not necessarily affected by general economic conditions that affect the commercial aerospace industry 

our presence in both the commercial aerospace and military sectors of the aerospace industry may mitigate the impact on our business of any specific industry risk we service a diversified customer base in the commercial and military aerospace industry and we provide components to a diverse installed base of aircraft which mitigates our exposure to any individual airframe platform at times declines in sales in one channel have been offset by increased sales in another however due to differences between the profitability of our products sold to oem and aftermarket customers variation in product mix can cause variation in gross margin 

there are many shortterm factors including inventory corrections unannounced changes in order patterns strikes and mergers and acquisitions that can cause shortterm disruptions in our quarterly shipment patterns as compared to previous quarters and the same periods in prior years as such it can be difficult to determine longerterm trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons to normalize for shortterm fluctuations we tend to look at our performance over several quarters or years of activity rather than discrete shortterm periods 

there are also fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering and delivery requests from quartertoquarter as well as variations in product mix from quartertoquarter that may cause positive or negative variations in gross profit margins since commercial aftermarket sales have historically produced a higher gross margin than sales to commercial oems again in many instances these are timing events between quarters and must be balanced with macro aerospace industry indicators 

commercial aftermarket 

the key growth factors in the commercial aftermarket include worldwide rpms and the size and activity level of the worldwide fleet of aircraft after a decline in rpms in 2009 worldwide rpms returned to growth between 2010 and 2016 and current industry consensus indicates that positive rpm growth will continue in 2017 

commercial oem market 

the commercial transport market sector the largest sector in the commercial oem market grew modestly during 2016 our commercial transport oem shipments and revenues generally run ahead of the boeing and airbus airframe delivery schedules as a result and consistent with prior years our fiscal 2017 shipments will be a function of among other things the estimated 2017 and 2018 commercial airframe production rates we have been experiencing increased sales in the large commercial oem sector aircraft with 100 or more seats driven by an increase in production by the boeing company and airbus sas tied to previous order announcements industry consensus indicates this production increase will continue in 2017 and 2018 though the growth may continue to moderate and begin to flatten 

defense 

our military business fluctuates from year to year and is dependent to a degree on government budget constraints the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts in recent years defense spending has reached historic highs due in part to the military engagements in afghanistan and iraq and the war on terrorism for a variety of reasons the military spending outlook is very uncertain for planning purposes we assume that military related sales of our types of products to be flat in future years over the recent high levels 

raw materials 

we require the use of various raw materials in our manufacturing processes we also purchase a variety of manufactured component parts from various suppliers at times we concentrate our orders among a few suppliers in order to strengthen our supplier relationships most of our raw materials and component parts are generally available from multiple suppliers at competitive prices 

intellectual property 

we have various trade secrets proprietary information trademarks trade names patents copyrights and other intellectual property rights which we believe in the aggregate but not individually are important to our business 

backlog 

as of september 30 2016  the company estimated its sales order backlog at 1554 million compared to an estimated sales order backlog of 1428 million as of september 30 2015  the increase in estimated sales order backlog is primarily due to acquisitions the majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of september 30 2016  are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months purchase orders may be subject to cancellation or deferral by the customer prior to shipment the level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of the company’s receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled accordingly the company’s backlog as of september 30 2016  may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period 

foreign operations 

although we manufacture a significant portion of our products in the united states we manufacture some products in belgium china germany hungary malaysia mexico norway sri lanka sweden and the united kingdom although the majority of sales of our products are made to customers including distributors located in the united states our products are ultimately sold to and used by customers including airlines and other end users of aircraft throughout the world a number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including currency fluctuations difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies 

restrictions on the repatriation of funds change in trade policies tariff regulation difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition 

environmental matters 

our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things discharges of pollutants into the air and water the generation handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees environmental laws and regulations may require that the company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations certain facilities and thirdparty sites utilized by the company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws the company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws 

employees 

as of september 30 2016  we had approximately 9300 fulltime parttime and temporary employees approximately 11 of our fulltime and parttime employees were represented by labor unions collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire at various dates ranging from november 2016 to april 2020 we consider our relationship with our employees generally to be satisfactory

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below are important risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business and financial condition and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

our commercial business is sensitive to the number of flight hours that our customers’ planes spend aloft the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and our customers’ profitability these items are in turn affected by general economic and geopolitical and other worldwide conditions 

our commercial business is directly affected by among other factors changes in revenue passenger miles rpms the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and to a lesser extent changes in the profitability of the commercial airline industry rpms and airline profitability have historically been correlated with the general economic environment although national and international events also play a key role for example in the past the airline industry has been severely affected by the downturn in the global economy higher fuel prices the increased security concerns among airline customers following the events of september 11 2001 the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars epidemic and the conflicts in afghanistan and iraq and could be impacted by future geopolitical or other worldwide events such as war terrorist acts or a worldwide infectious disease outbreak in addition global market and economic conditions have been challenging with turbulence in the us and international markets and economies and have prolonged declines in business and consumer spending as a result of the substantial reduction in airline traffic resulting from these events the airline industry incurred large losses and financial difficulties some carriers have also parked or retired a portion of their fleets and have reduced workforces and flights during periods of reduced airline profitability some airlines may delay purchases of spare parts preferring instead to deplete existing inventories if demand for new aircraft and spare parts decreases there would be a decrease in demand for certain of our products an adverse change in demand could impact our results of operations collection of accounts receivable and our expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses which may adversely impact our financial condition and access to capital markets 

our sales to manufacturers of aircraft are cyclical and a downturn in sales to these manufacturers may adversely affect us 

our sales to manufacturers of large commercial aircraft such as the boeing company airbus sas and related oem suppliers as well as manufacturers of business jets which accounted for approximately 27 of our net sales in fiscal year 2016  have historically experienced periodic downturns in the past these sales have been affected by airline profitability which is impacted by among other things fuel and labor costs price competition downturns in the global economy and national and international events in addition sales of our products to manufacturers of business jets are impacted by among other things downturns in the global economy downturns adversely affect our net sales gross margin and net income 

we rely heavily on certain customers for much of our sales 

our two largest customers for fiscal year 2016  were airbus sas which includes satair as and the boeing company which includes aviall inc airbus sas accounted for approximately 13 of our net sales and the boeing company accounted for approximately 12 of our net sales in fiscal year 2016  our top ten customers for fiscal year 2016  accounted for approximately 45 of our net sales a material reduction in purchasing by one of our larger customers for any reason including but not limited to economic downturn decreased production strike or resourcing could have a material adverse effect on our net sales gross margin and net income 

we generally do not have guaranteed future sales of our products further when we enter into fixed price contracts with some of our customers we take the risk for cost overruns 

as is customary in our business we do not generally have longterm contracts with most of our aftermarket customers and therefore do not have guaranteed future sales although we have longterm contracts with many of our oem customers many of those customers may terminate the contracts on short notice and in most cases our customers have not committed to buy any minimum quantity of our products in addition in certain cases we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon the historic purchasing patterns of customers and upon our discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements and this anticipated future volume of orders may not materialize 

we also have entered into multiyear fixedprice contracts with some of our customers pursuant to which we have agreed to perform the work for a fixed price and accordingly realize all the benefit or detriment resulting from any decreases or increases in the costs of making these products sometimes we accept a fixedprice contract for a product that we have not yet produced and this increases the risk of cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product most of our contracts do not permit us to recover increases in raw material prices taxes or labor costs 

us military spending is dependent upon the us defense budget 

the military and defense market is significantly dependent upon government budget trends particularly the us department of defense the “dod” budget in addition to normal business risks our supply of products to the united states government is subject to unique risks largely beyond our control dod budgets could be negatively impacted by several factors including but not limited to a change in defense spending policy by the current presidential administration the us government’s budget deficits spending priorities the cost of sustaining the us military presence in the middle east and possible political pressure to reduce us government military spending each of which could cause the dod budget to remain unchanged or to decline a significant decline in us military expenditures could result in a reduction in the amount of our products sold to the various agencies and buying organizations of the us government 

we intend to pursue acquisitions our business may be adversely affected if we cannot consummate acquisitions on satisfactory terms or if we cannot effectively integrate acquired operations 

a significant portion of our growth has occurred through acquisitions any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions we intend to pursue acquisitions that we believe will present opportunities consistent with our overall business strategy however we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates to purchase or may be unable to acquire desired businesses or assets on economically acceptable terms in addition we may not be able to raise the capital necessary to fund future acquisitions because we may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously we may encounter unforeseen expenses complications and delays including regulatory complications or difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight 

we regularly engage in discussions with respect to potential acquisition and investment opportunities if we consummate an acquisition our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly future acquisitions could result in margin dilution and further likely result in the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest and amortization expenses or periodic impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets as well as significant charges relating to integration costs 

acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect in addition we may not be able to successfully integrate any business we acquire into our existing business the successful integration of new businesses depends on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs the successful integration of future acquisitions may also require substantial attention from our senior management and the management of the acquired business which could decrease the time that they have to service attract customers and develop new products and services or attend to other acquisition opportunities 

we are subject to certain unique business risks as a result of supplying equipment and services to the us government 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 

 most of our us government contracts can be terminated by the us government for its convenience without significant notice termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination 

on contracts for which the price is based on cost the us government may review our costs and performance as well as our accounting and general business practices based on the results of such audits the us government may adjust our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs in addition under us government purchasing regulations some of our costs including most financing costs amortization of intangible assets portions of research and development costs and certain marketing expenses may not be subject to reimbursement 

furthermore even where the price is not based on cost the us government may seek to review our costs to determine whether our pricing is “fair and reasonable” our subsidiaries are periodically subject to a pricing review such a review could be costly and time consuming for our management and could distract from our ability to effectively manage the business as a result of such a review we could be subject to providing a refund to the us government or we could be asked to enter into an arrangement whereby our prices would be based on cost or the dod could seek to pursue alternative sources of supply for our parts any of those occurrences could lead to a reduction in our revenue from or the profitability of certain of our supply arrangements with certain agencies and buying organizations of the us government 

moreover us government purchasing regulations contain a number of additional operation requirements which do not apply to entities not engaged in government contracting failure to comply with such government contracting requirements could result in civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

our business may be adversely affected if we would lose our government or industry approvals or if more stringent government regulations are enacted or if industry oversight is increased 

the aerospace industry is highly regulated in the united states and in other countries in order to sell our components we and the components we manufacture must be certified by the faa the dod and similar agencies in foreign countries and by individual manufacturers if new and more stringent government regulations are adopted or if industry oversight increases we might incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or heightened industry oversight in addition if material authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended our business would be adversely affected 

in addition to the aviation approvals we are at times required to obtain approval from us government agencies to export our products failure to obtain approval to export or determination by the us government that we failed to receive required approvals or licenses could eliminate or restrict our ability to sell our products outside the united states and the penalties that could be imposed by the us government for failure to comply with these laws could be significant 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and could harm our ability to react to changes to our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of september 30 2016  our total indebtedness excluding approximately 17 million  of outstanding letters of credit was approximately 102 billion  which was 1068  of our total book capitalization as a result of our prior year dividends being funded with indebtedness and the addition of approximately 18 billion  in net new debt during fiscal 2016  we also incurred additional indebtedness subsequent to september 30 2016 more fully described in note 23 “subsequent events” in the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein 

in addition we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future for example as of september 30 2016  we had approximately 583 million  of unused commitments under our revolving loan facility and 50 million of unused capacity under our trade receivable securitization facility the “securitization facility” with the availability of the capacity under the securitization facility being dependent on the amount of our trade receivables although our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the various senior subordinated notes outstanding the “indentures” contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these qualifications and exceptions could be substantial for example if the usage of the revolving loan facility exceeds 25 of the total revolving commitments the company will be 

required to maintain a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio of net debt as defined to trailing fourquarter ebitda as defined a breach of any of the covenants or an inability to comply with the required leverage ratio could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the indentures 

our substantial debt could also have other important consequences to investors for example it could 

 in addition all of our debt under the senior secured credit facility which includes 53 billion  in term loans and a revolving loan facility of 600 million bears interest at floating rates accordingly if interest rates increase our debt service expense will also increase interest rate swap and cap agreements are used to manage interest rate risk associated with floatingrate borrowings under our credit facilities for information about our interest rate swap and cap agreements see note 20 “derivatives and hedging instruments” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness including the indentures we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital 

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness including the indentures amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility amounts due under our securitization facility and to fund our operations will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future which to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness including the amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility amounts borrowed under our securitization facility and the indentures or to fund our other liquidity needs if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital we cannot assure that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations the terms of existing or future debt instruments the securitization facility the indentures and the senior secured credit facility may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives in addition any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms and would otherwise adversely affect the indentures 

the terms of the senior secured credit facility and indentures may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

our senior secured credit facility and the indentures contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indentures and may limit their ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests the senior secured credit facility and indentures include covenants restricting among 

other things the ability of td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indentures to 

 a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the indentures if any such default occurs the lenders under the senior secured credit facility and the holders of the senior subordinated notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder to be immediately due and payable the lenders under the senior secured credit facility also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings in addition following an event of default under the senior secured credit facility the lenders under that facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which includes our available cash and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the senior subordinated notes if the debt under the senior secured credit facility or the senior subordinated notes were to be accelerated we cannot assure that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations 

our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things discharges of pollutants into the air and water the generation handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees environmental laws and regulations may require that the company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations certain facilities and thirdparty sites utilized by subsidiaries of the company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws the company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws 

estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are based on current facts laws regulations and technology these estimates take into consideration the company’s prior experience and professional judgment of the company’s environmental advisors estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination the range of remediation alternatives available evolving remediation standards imprecise engineering evaluations and cost estimates the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 

accordingly as investigation and remediation proceed it is likely that adjustments in the company’s accruals will be necessary to reflect new information the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in a given period based on currently available information however the company does not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition 

we are dependent on our highly trained employees and any work stoppage or difficulty hiring similar employees could adversely affect our business 

because our products are complicated and highly engineered we depend on an educated and trained workforce there is substantial competition for skilled personnel in the aircraft component industry and we could be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled employees we may not be able to fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover or attract and retain qualified personnel 

although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory we cannot assure that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory renewal of collective bargaining agreements or that our employee relations will remain stable because 

we maintain a relatively small inventory of finished goods any work stoppage could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide products to our customers 

our business is dependent on the availability of certain components and raw materials from suppliers 

our business is affected by the price and availability of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our components our business therefore could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our suppliers such as the destruction of our suppliers’ facilities or their distribution infrastructure a work stoppage or strike by our suppliers’ employees or the failure of our suppliers to provide materials of the requisite quality or by increased costs of such raw materials or components if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers because we maintain a relatively small inventory of raw materials and component parts our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers or alternative raw materials or component parts the lengthy and expensive faa and oem certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier raw material or component part 

our operations depend on our manufacturing facilities which are subject to physical and other risks that could disrupt production 

a number of our manufacturing facilities are located in the greater los angeles area an area known for earthquakes and are thus vulnerable to damage in addition a number of our manufacturing facilities are located along the eastern seaboard area susceptible to hurricanes we are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters including power loss fire explosions floods communications failures terrorist attacks and similar events disruptions could also occur due to cyberattacks computer or equipment malfunction accidental or intentional operator error or process failures any disruption of our ability to operate our business could result in a material decrease in our revenues or significant additional costs to replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

operations and sales outside of the united states may be subject to additional risks 

a number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including currency fluctuations difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies restrictions on the repatriation of funds change in trade policies tariff regulation difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition furthermore the company is subject to laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act uk bribery act and similar local antibribery laws which generally prohibit companies and their employees agents and contractors from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure to comply with these laws could subject the company to civil and criminal penalties that could materially adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

we face significant competition 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry and compete against a number of companies competitors in our product lines are both us and foreign companies and range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privately held entities we believe that our ability to compete depends on high product performance consistent high quality short leadtime and timely delivery competitive pricing superior customer service and support and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs we may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive 

we could be adversely affected if one of our components causes an aircraft to crash 

our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we have designed manufactured or serviced while we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future product liability claims in the event of product liability claims our insurers may attempt to deny coverage or any coverage we have may not be adequate we also may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost any liability not covered by insurance or for which third party indemnification is not available could result in significant liability to us 

in addition a crash caused by one of our components could damage our reputation for quality products we believe our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting a provider of aircraft components if a crash were to be caused by one of our components or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of data protection concerns 

the interpretation and application of data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are uncertain and evolving it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices compliance could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

in addition despite our efforts to protect confidential information our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to data loss including cyberattacks this could lead to negative publicity legal claims theft modification or destruction of proprietary or key information damage to or inaccessibility of critical systems manufacture of defective products production downtimes operational disruptions and other significant costs which could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and results of operations 

we have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets which may never generate the returns we expect 

mergers and acquisitions have resulted in significant increases in identifiable intangible assets and goodwill identifiable intangible assets which primarily include trademarks trade names trade secrets and technology were approximately 18 billion  at september 30 2016  representing approximately 16  of our total assets goodwill recognized in accounting for the mergers and acquisitions was approximately 57 billion  at september 30 2016  representing approximately 53  of our total assets we may never realize the full value of our identifiable intangible assets and goodwill and to the extent we were to determine that our identifiable intangible assets or our goodwill were impaired within the meaning of applicable accounting standards we would be required to writeoff the amount of any impairment 

the company may be subject to risks relating to changes in its tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities 

          the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and various nonus jurisdictions the company’s domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions the company’s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the company’s effective tax rate as a result of changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets challenges by tax authorities or changes in tax laws or regulations in addition the amount of income taxes paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by us federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the company’s tax liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

our stock price may be volatile and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 

there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities which is unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities these broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock shareholders may not be able to sell their shares at or above the purchase price due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects including possible changes due to the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry and other factors such as fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering which could cause shortterm swings in profit margins or unrelated to our operating performance including market conditions affecting the stock market generally or the stocks of aerospace companies more specifically 

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our share price 

we may sell additional shares of common stock into the public markets or issue convertible debt securities to raise capital in the future the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public markets or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities to raise capital at a time and price that we deem appropriate 

our corporate documents and delaware law contain certain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable for example our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 149600000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock without stockholder approval the board of directors has the authority to attach special rights including voting and dividend rights to this preferred stock with these rights holders of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75 of the voting power of our issued and outstanding capital stock voting together as a single class is required for the alteration amendment or repeal of certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and certain provisions of our amended and restated bylaws including the provisions relating to our stockholders’ ability to call special meetings notice provisions for stockholder business to be conducted at an annual meeting requests for stockholder lists and corporate records nomination and removal of directors and filling of vacancies on our board of directors 

we are also subject to the antitakeover provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law under these provisions if anyone becomes an “interested stockholder” we may not enter into a “business combination” with that person for three years without special approval which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change of control for purposes of section 203 “interested stockholder” means generally someone owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years subject to certain exceptions as described in section 203 

we do not regularly declare and pay quarterly or annual cash dividends on our stock 

on july 3 2013 june 4 2014 and october 14 2016 the company’s board of directors authorized and declared special cash dividends of 2200 2500 and 2400 respectively on each outstanding share of common stock and cash dividend equivalent payments to holders of options under its stock option plans 

notwithstanding the special cash dividends declared in july 2013 june 2014 and october 2016 we do not anticipate declaring regular quarterly or annual cash dividends on our common stock or any other equity security in the foreseeable future the amounts that may be available to us to pay future special cash dividends are restricted under our debt and other agreements any payment of special cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations earnings capital requirements financial condition future prospects contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors therefore shareholders should not rely on regular quarterly or annual dividend income from shares of our common stock and should not rely on special dividends with any regularity or at all

 item 7 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected financial data” and td group’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report the following discussion may contain predictions estimates and other forwardlooking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties including those discussed under the heading entitled “risk factors” included elsewhere in this report these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 

overview 

for fiscal year 2016  we generated net sales of 31714 million  gross profit of 17281 million  or 545  of sales and net income of 5864 million  we believe we have achieved steady longterm growth in sales and improvements in operating performance since our formation in 1993 due to our competitive strengths and through execution of our valuedriven operating strategy more specifically focusing our businesses on our valuedriven operating strategy of obtaining profitable new business carefully controlling the cost structure and pricing our highly engineered valueadded products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so has historically resulted in improvements in gross profit and income from operations over the long term 

our selective acquisition strategy has also contributed to the growth of our business the integration of certain acquisitions into our existing businesses combined with implementing our proven operating strategy has historically resulted in improvements of the financial performance of the acquired business 

our key competitive strengths and the elements of our business strategy are set forth in more detail below 

we believe our key competitive strengths include 

large and growing installed product base with aftermarket revenue stream  we provide components to a large and growing installed base of aircraft to which we supply aftermarket products we estimate that our products are installed on approximately 95000 commercial transport regional transport military and general aviation fixed wing turbine aircraft and rotary wing aircraft 

diversified revenue base  we believe that our diversified revenue base reduces our dependence on any particular product platform or market channel and has been a significant factor in maintaining our financial performance our products are installed on almost all of the major commercial aircraft platforms now in production we expect to continue to develop new products for military and commercial applications 

significant barriers to entry  we believe that the niche nature of our markets the industry’s stringent regulatory and certification requirements the large number of products that we sell and the investments necessary to develop and certify products create barriers to entry for potential competitors 

our business strategy is made up of two key elements 1 a valuedriven operating strategy focused around our three core value drivers and 2 a selective acquisition strategy 

valuedriven operating strategy  our three core value drivers are 

 selective acquisition strategy  we selectively pursue the acquisition of proprietary aerospace component businesses when we see an opportunity to create value through the application of our three core valuedriven operating strategies the aerospace industry in particular remains highly fragmented with many of the companies in the industry being small private businesses or small noncore operations of larger businesses we have significant experience among our management team in executing acquisitions and integrating acquired businesses into our company and culture as of the date of this report we have successfully acquired 58 businesses andor product lines since our formation in 1993 many of these acquisitions have been 

integrated into an existing transdigm production facility which enables a higher production capacity utilization which in turn improves gross profit levels due to the ability to spread the fixed manufacturing overhead costs over higher production volume

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations however investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 

below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions for additional accounting policies see note 3 “summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

revenue recognition and related allowances  revenue is recognized from the sale of products when title and risk of loss passes to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment substantially all product sales are made pursuant to firm fixedprice purchase orders received from customers collectibility of amounts recorded as revenue is reasonably assured at the time of sale provisions for returns uncollectible accounts and the cost of repairs under contract warranty provisions are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are principally based on historical results modified as appropriate by the most current information available we have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of such allowances however due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process it is possible that actual results may vary from the estimates and the differences could be material 

management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable and customer creditworthiness the allowance also incorporates a provision for the estimated impact of disputes with customers management’s estimate of the allowance amounts that are necessary includes amounts for specifically identified credit losses and estimated credit losses based on historical information the determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to significant levels of judgment and estimation by management depending on the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues or if the financial condition of any of the company’s customers were to deteriorate and their ability to make required payments were to become impaired increases in these allowances may be required historically changes in estimates in the allowance for doubtful accounts have not been significant 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost of inventories is generally determined by the average cost and the firstin firstout fifo methods and includes material labor and overhead related to the manufacturing process because the company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be inservice for 25 or more years it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use where management estimated that the current market value was below cost or determined that future demand was lower than current inventory levels based on historical experience current and projected market demand current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value was made by recording a provision included in cost of sales although management believes that the company’s estimates of excess and obsolete inventory are reasonable actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future in addition in accordance with industry practice all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year historically changes in estimates in the net realizable value of inventories have not been significant 

goodwill and other intangible assets  in accordance with asc 805 “business combinations” the company uses the acquisition method of accounting to allocate costs of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess costs of acquired businesses over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized as goodwill the valuations of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results in addition to using management estimates and negotiated amounts the company used a variety of information sources to determine the estimated fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including thirdparty appraisals for the estimated value and lives of identifiable intangible assets   fair value adjustments to the company’s assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition  

intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights or if the intangible asset can be sold transferred licensed or exchanged regardless of the company’s intent to do so goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition and are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates 

gaap requires that the annual and any interim impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level the reporting unit level is one level below an operating segment substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each reporting unit pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction with respect to acquisitions integrated into an existing reporting unit any acquired goodwill is combined with the goodwill of the reporting unit 

at the time of goodwill impairment testing management determines the estimated fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit if the calculated estimated fair value is less than the current carrying value impairment of goodwill of the reporting unit may exist the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing includes discount rates growth rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates are set by using the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” methodology the wacc methodology considers market and industry data as well as company specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business 

management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates as an indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately through the use of the discounted cash flow valuation model the aggregate of all reporting unit’s estimated fair value is reconciled to the total market capitalization of the company 

the company had 32 reporting units with goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 the date of the last annual impairment test the estimated fair values of each of the reporting units was substantially in excess of their respective carrying values and therefore no goodwill impairment was recorded the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate which is a significant assumption in the calculation of fair values with a one percentage point increase in the discount rate the reporting units would continue to have fair values substantially in excess of their respective carrying values 

management tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at the asset level as determined by appropriate asset valuation at the time of acquisition the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets consists of a comparison between the estimated fair values and carrying values if the carrying amounts of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives exceed their estimated fair values an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference management utilizes the royalty savings valuation method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset in this method management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset the key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates royalty rates growth rates sales projections and terminal value rates discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the wacc methodology considering any differences in companyspecific risk factors between reporting units and the indefinitelived intangible assets royalty rates are established by management with the advice of valuation experts and periodically substantiated by valuation experts management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant intangible asset terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates 

the discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed actual results could differ from these assumptions management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering the current economic conditions 

stockbased compensation  the cost of the company’s stockbased compensation is recorded in accordance with asc 718 “stock compensation” the company uses a blackscholesmerton option pricing model to estimate the grantdate fair value of the stock options awarded the blackscholesmerton model requires assumptions regarding the expected volatility of the company’s common shares the riskfree interest rate the expected life of the stock options award and the company’s dividend yield the company utilizes historical data in determining these assumptions an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside of management’s control could have an impact on the blackscholesmerton model 

income taxes  the company estimates income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates this involves estimating taxable earnings specific taxable and deductible items the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits to the extent these estimates change adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes are made in the period in which the changes occur historically such adjustments have not been significant

backlog 

for information about our backlog see item 1  “business” 

foreign operations 

our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately 11695 million  8811 million  and 7359 million  for fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks including foreign currency fluctuations the impact of foreign government regulations political uncertainties and differences in business practices there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments’ countries furthermore there can be no assurance that the political cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 

inflation 

many of the company’s raw materials and operating expenses are sensitive to the effects of inflation which could result in changing operating costs the effects of inflation on the company’s businesses during the fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  were immaterial 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically maintained a capital structure comprising a mix of equity and debt financing we vary our leverage both to optimize our equity return and to pursue acquisitions we expect to meet our current debt obligations as they come due through internally generated funds from current levels of operations andor through refinancing in the debt markets prior to the maturity dates of our debt 

we continually evaluate our debt facilities to assess whether they most efficiently and effectively meet the current and future needs of our business the company evaluates from time to time the appropriateness of its current leverage taking into consideration the company’s debt holders equity holders credit ratings acquisition opportunities and other factors the company’s debt leverage ratio which is computed as total debt divided by ebitda as defined for the applicable twelvemonth period has varied widely during the company’s history ranging from approximately 35 to 70 our debt leverage ratio at september 30 2016  was approximately 68  

the company regularly engages in discussions with respect to potential acquisitions and investments however there can be no assurance that the company will be able to consummate an agreement with respect to any future acquisition the company’s acquisition strategy may require substantial capital and no assurance can be given that the company will be able to raise any necessary funds on acceptable terms or at all if the company incurs additional debt to finance acquisitions total interest expense will increase 

if the company has excess cash it may consider methods by which it can provide cash to its debt or equity holders through a dividend prepayment of indebtedness repurchase of stock repurchase of debt or other means whether the company undertakes additional stock repurchases or other aforementioned activities will depend on prevailing market conditions the company’s liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material in addition the company may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so 

the company’s ability to make scheduled interest payments on or to refinance the company’s indebtedness or to fund nonacquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on the company’s ability to generate cash in the future this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control 

as a result of the debt financings in june 2016 and october 2016 interest payments will increase going forward in line with the terms of the related debt agreements based on its current levels of operations and absent any disruptive events management believes that the continued application of our three core valuedriven operating strategies obtaining profitable new business continually improve our cost structure and providing highly engineered valueadded products to customers will provide the internally generated funds combined with the borrowings available under our revolving loan facility to finance its operations nonacquisition related capital expenditures research and development efforts and longterm indebtedness obligations through at least fiscal 2017 there can be no assurance however that the company’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities or that future borrowings will be available to the company under the senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its indebtedness or to fund its other liquidity needs the company may need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness on or before maturity also to the extent the company 

accelerates its growth plans consummates acquisitions or has lower than anticipated sales or increases in expenses the company may also need to raise additional capital in particular increased working capital needs occur whenever the company consummates acquisitions or experiences strong incremental demand there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

in the future the company may increase its borrowings in connection with acquisitions if cash flow from operating activities becomes insufficient to fund current operations or for other shortterm cash needs or for stock repurchases or dividends our future leverage will also be impacted by the then current conditions of the credit markets 

operating activities  the company generated 6689 million  of net cash from operating activities during fiscal 2016  compared to 5209 million  during fiscal 2015  a net increase of 1480 million  the increase is primarily attributable to a 1392 million  increase in income from operations other items impacting the change in net cash from operating activities were items adjusting net income for noncash expenses and income which increased by 334 million when excluding the impact of the company’s adoption of asu 201609 in fiscal 2016 the prospective adoption of asu 201609 in fiscal 2016 as further detailed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included herein resulted in an increase in net cash flow from operating activities of approximately 436 million compared to a decrease in net cash flow from operating activities of approximately 620 million in fiscal 2015 partially offsetting the increase in net cash from operating activities was higher interest payments of 497 million  and higher income tax payments of 559 million  the increase in interest payments is attributable to timing differences of the payments and the increase in principal from the june 2016 and may 2015 debt financing activities the increase in income tax payments is attributable to higher income before income taxes and lower excess tax benefits on sharebased payment arrangements compared to fiscal 2015 

changes in trade accounts receivable inventories and accounts payable provided approximately 483 million less cash flow when compared to fiscal 2015 the change in trade accounts receivable during fiscal 2016 was a use of 801 million  in cash compared to a use of cash of 254 million  in fiscal 2015 which is an additional use of cash of 547 million  year over year the higher use of cash in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 is attributable to the timing of sales and collections on trade accounts receivable that resulted from stronger sales in the latter half of the fourth quarter which pushed collections on the related trade accounts receivable into fiscal 2017 the company has also had a higher volume of sales and trade accounts receivable with foreign jurisdictions which historically have had longer collection periods days sales outstanding at september 30 2016 increased to 54 days from 50 days sales outstanding at september 30 2015 

the change in inventories was a use of cash of 21 million  in fiscal 2016 compared to a use of cash of 260 million  in fiscal 2015 the decrease in the use of cash in fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to the stronger sales volume in the latter half of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 which depleted onhand inventory levels at a higher rate than during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 in connection with increased monitoring of inventory management inventory turnover was at 222 at september 30 2016 compared to 260 at september 30 2015 

the change in accounts payable during fiscal 2016 was a use of cash of 67 million  compared to a source of cash of 135 million  in fiscal 2015 the increase in the use of cash was primarily attributable to a lower volume of purchases in response to the increased monitoring of inventory management during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 as well as the timing of payments to vendors 

the company generated 5209 million  of net cash from operating activities during fiscal 2015  compared to 5412 million  during fiscal 2014  the net decrease of 203 million was due primarily to higher interest payments due to the company’s current debt structure offset by an increase in income from operations

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

 item 1 business 

the company 

transdigm inc was formed in 1993 in connection with a leveraged buyout transaction td group was formed in 2003 to facilitate a leveraged buyout of transdigm inc the company was owned by private equity funds until its initial public offering in 2006 td group’s common stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange or nyse under the ticker symbol “tdg” 

we believe we are a leading global designer producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers we estimate that about 90 of our net sales for fiscal year 2015 were generated by proprietary products in addition for fiscal year 2015 we estimate that we generated about 80 of our net sales from products for which we are the sole source provider 

most of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue once our parts are designed into and sold on a new aircraft we generate net sales from aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft which is generally estimated to be approximately 25 to 30 years a typical platform can be produced for 20 to 30 years giving us an estimated product life cycle in excess of 50 years we estimate that approximately 54 of our net sales in fiscal year 2015 were generated from aftermarket sales the vast majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets these aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and been more stable than sales to original equipment manufacturers or oems 

products 

we primarily design produce and supply highlyengineered proprietary aerospace components and certain systemssubsystems with significant aftermarket content we seek to develop highly customized products to solve specific needs for aircraft operators and manufacturers we attempt to differentiate ourselves based on engineering service and manufacturing capabilities we typically choose not to compete for nonproprietary “build to print” business because it frequently offers lower 

margins than proprietary products we believe that our products have strong brand names within the industry and that we have a reputation for high quality reliability and customer support 

our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products that we offer to our customers some of our more significant product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and engine technology specialized pumps and valves power conditioning devices specialized acdc electric motors and generators nicad batteries and chargers engineered latching and locking devices rods and locking devices engineered connectors and elastomers cockpit security components and systems specialized cockpit displays aircraft audio systems specialized lavatory components seat belts and safety restraints engineered interior surfaces and related components lighting and control technology military personnel parachutes and cargo loading handling and delivery systems

the company’s businesses are organized and managed in three reporting segments power  control airframe and nonaviation 

the power  control segment includes operations that primarily develop produce and market systems and components that predominately provide power to or control power of the aircraft utilizing electronic fluid power and mechanical motion control technologies major product offerings include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and engine technology specialized pumps and valves power conditioning devices specialized acdc electric motors and generators and cargo loading and handling systems primary customers of this segment are engine and power system and subsystem suppliers airlines third party maintenance suppliers military buying agencies and repair depots products are sold in the original equipment and aftermarket market channels 

the airframe segment includes operations that primarily develop produce and market systems and components that are used in nonpower airframe applications utilizing airframe and cabin structure technologies major product offerings include engineered latching and locking devices rods and locking devices engineered connectors and elastomers cockpit security components and systems aircraft audio systems specialized lavatory components seat belts and safety restraints engineered interior surfaces and related components lighting and control technology military personnel parachutes and cargo delivery systems primary customers of this segment are airframe manufacturers and cabin system suppliers and subsystem suppliers airlines third party maintenance suppliers military buying agencies and repair depots products are sold in the original equipment and aftermarket market channels 

the nonaviation segment includes operations that primarily develop produce and market products for nonaviation markets major product offerings include seat belts and safety restraints for ground transportation applications mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls for space applications and refueling systems for heavy equipment used in mining construction and other industries primary customers of this segment are offroad vehicle suppliers and subsystem suppliers child restraint system suppliers satellite and space system suppliers and manufacturers of heavy equipment used in mining construction and other industries 

for financial information about our segments see note 16 “segments” to our consolidated financial statements 

sales and marketing 

consistent with our overall strategy our sales and marketing organization is structured to continually develop technical solutions that meet customer needs in particular we attempt to focus on products and programs that will lead to highmargin repeatable sales in the aftermarket 

we have structured our sales efforts along our major product offerings assigning a business unit manager to certain products each business unit manager is expected to grow the sales and profitability of the products for which he or she is responsible and to achieve the targeted annual level of bookings sales new business and profitability for such products the business unit managers are assisted by account managers and sales engineers who are responsible for covering major oem and aftermarket accounts account managers and sales engineers are expected to be familiar with the personnel organization and needs of specific customers to achieve total bookings and new business goals at each account and together with the product managers to determine when additional resources are required at customer locations most of our sales personnel are evaluated in part on their bookings and their ability to identify and obtain new business opportunities 

though typically performed by employees the account manager function may be performed by independent representatives depending on the specific customer product and geographic location we also use a number of distributors to provide logistical support as well as primary customer contact with certain smaller accounts our major distributors are aviall inc a subsidiary of the boeing company and satair as a subsidiary of airbus sas 

manufacturing and engineering 

we maintain 52 principal manufacturing facilities most of our manufacturing facilities are comprised of manufacturing distribution and engineering functions and most facilities have certain administrative functions including management sales and finance we continually strive to improve productivity and reduce costs including rationalization of operations developing improved control systems that allow for accurate product profit and loss accounting investing in equipment tooling information systems and implementing broadbased employee training programs management believes that our manufacturing systems and equipment contribute to our ability to compete by permitting us to meet the rigorous tolerances and cost sensitive price structure of aircraft component customers 

we attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by producing uniquely engineered products with high quality and timely delivery our engineering costs are recorded in cost of sales and in selling and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income total engineering expense represents approximately 6 of our operating units’ aggregate costs or approximately 4 of our consolidated net sales our proprietary products and particularly our new product initiatives are designed by our engineers and are intended to serve the needs of the aircraft component industry these proprietary designs must withstand the extraordinary conditions and stresses that will be endured by products during use and meet the rigorous demands of our customers’ tolerance and quality requirements 

we use sophisticated equipment and procedures to comply with quality requirements specifications and federal aviation administration “faa” and oem requirements we perform a variety of testing procedures including testing under different temperature humidity and altitude levels shock and vibration testing and xray fluorescent measurement these procedures together with other customer approved techniques for document process and quality control are used throughout our manufacturing facilities 

customers 

our customers include 1 distributors of aerospace components 2 worldwide commercial airlines including national and regional airlines 3 large commercial transport and regional and business aircraft oems 4 various armed forces of the united states and friendly foreign governments 5 defense oems 6 system suppliers and 7 various other industrial customers for the year ended september 30 2015 the boeing company which includes aviall inc a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world accounted for approximately 12 of our net sales and airbus sas accounted for approximately 11 of our net sales our top ten customers for fiscal year 2015 accounted for approximately 46 of our net sales products supplied to many of our customers are used on multiple platforms 

active commercial production programs include the boeing 737 747 767 777 and 787 the airbus a3192021 a330a340 a350 and a380 the bombardier crj’s challenger and learjets the embraer rj’s the cessna citation family the raytheon premier and hawker and most gulfstream airframes military platforms include aircraft such as the boeing c17 f15 f18 and v22 the airbus a400m the lockheed martin c130j f16 and f35 joint strikefighter the northrop grumman e2c hawkeye the sikorsky uh60 helicopter ch47 chinook and ah64 apache helicopters the general atomics predator drone and the raytheon patriot missile transdigm has been awarded numerous contracts for the development of engineered products for production on the airbus a320 neo the boeing 737 max the sikorsky s97 jmr helicopter and boeing p8 poseidon 

the demand for our aftermarket parts and services depends on among other things the breadth of our installed oem base revenue passenger miles “rpms” the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and to a lesser extent airline profitability we believe that we are also a leading supplier of components used on us designed military aircraft including components that are used on a variety of fighter aircraft military freighters and military helicopters 

competition 

the niche markets within the aerospace industry that we serve are relatively fragmented and we face several competitors for many of the products and services we provide due to the global nature of the commercial aircraft industry competition in these categories comes from both us and foreign companies competitors in our product offerings range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privatelyheld entities with only one or two components in their entire product portfolios 

we compete on the basis of engineering manufacturing and marketing high quality products which we believe meet or exceed the performance and maintenance requirements of our customers consistent and timely delivery and superior customer service and support the industry’s stringent regulatory certification and technical requirements and the investments necessary in the development and certification of products create barriers to entry for potential new competitors as long as customers receive products that meet or exceed expectations and performance standards we believe that they will have a reduced incentive to certify another supplier because of the cost and time of the technical design and testing certification process in addition we believe that the availability dependability and safety of our products are reasons for our customers to continue longterm supplier relationships 

government contracts 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 1 suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations 2 terminate existing contracts 3 reduce the value of existing contracts 4 audit our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs and 5 control and potentially prohibit the export of our products 

governmental regulation 

the commercial aircraft component industry is highly regulated by the faa in the united states and by the joint aviation authorities in europe and other agencies throughout the world while the military aircraft component industry is governed by military quality specifications we and the components we manufacture are required to be certified by one or more of these entities or agencies and in many cases by individual oems in order to engineer and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models 

we must also satisfy the requirements of our customers including oems and airlines that are subject to faa regulations and provide these customers with products and services that comply with the government regulations applicable to commercial flight operations in addition the faa requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components we believe that we currently satisfy or exceed these maintenance standards in our repair and overhaul services we also maintain several faa approved repair stations 

in addition our businesses are subject to many other laws and requirements typically applicable to manufacturers and exporters without limiting the foregoing sales of many of our products that will be used on aircraft owned by foreign entities are subject to compliance with export control laws and the manufacture of our products and the operations of our businesses including the disposal of hazardous wastes are subject to compliance with applicable environmental laws 

raw materials 

we require the use of various raw materials in our manufacturing processes we also purchase a variety of manufactured component parts from various suppliers at times we concentrate our orders among a few suppliers in order to strengthen our supplier relationships most of our raw materials and component parts are generally available from multiple suppliers at competitive prices 

intellectual property 

we have various trade secrets proprietary information trademarks trade names patents copyrights and other intellectual property rights which we believe in the aggregate but not individually are important to our business 

backlog 

as of september 30 2015 the company estimated its sales order backlog at 1428 million compared to an estimated sales order backlog of 1195 million as of september 30 2014 the increase in estimated sales order backlog of approximately 233 million is primarily due to acquisitions the majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of september 30 2015 are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months purchase orders may be subject to cancellation or deferral by the customer prior to shipment the level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of the company’s receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled accordingly the company’s backlog as of september 30 2015 may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period 

foreign operations 

although we manufacture a significant portion of our products in the united states we manufacture some products in belgium china germany hungary malaysia mexico norway sri lanka sweden and the united kingdom although the majority of sales of our products are made to customers including distributors located in the united states our products are ultimately sold to and used by customers including airlines and other end users of aircraft throughout the world a number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including currency fluctuations difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies restrictions on the repatriation of funds change in trade policies tariff regulation difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition 

our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately 8811 million  7359 million  and 5720 million  for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks including foreign currency fluctuations the impact of foreign government regulations political uncertainties and differences in business practices there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a 

direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments’ countries furthermore there can be no assurance that the political cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 

environmental matters 

our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things discharges of pollutants into the air and water the generation handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees environmental laws and regulations may require that the company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations certain facilities and thirdparty sites utilized by the company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws the company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws 

estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are based on current facts laws regulations and technology these estimates take into consideration the company’s prior experience and professional judgment of the company’s environmental advisors estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination the range of remediation alternatives available evolving remediation standards imprecise engineering evaluations and cost estimates the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 

accordingly as investigation and remediation proceed it is likely that adjustments in the company’s accruals will be necessary to reflect new information the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in a given period based on currently available information however the company does not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition 

environmental liabilities are recorded when the liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable which generally is not later than at completion of a feasibility study or when the company has recommended a remedy or has committed to an appropriate plan of action the liabilities are reviewed periodically and as investigation and remediation proceed adjustments are made as necessary liabilities for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not consider the effects of inflation and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value the liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties but do reflect anticipated allocations among potentially responsible parties at federal superfund sites or similar statemanaged sites third party indemnity obligations and an assessment of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their obligations at such sites 

employees 

as of september 30 2015 we had approximately 8200 fulltime parttime and temporary employees approximately 8 of our fulltime and parttime employees were represented by labor unions collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire at various dates ranging from april 2016 to may 2018 we consider our relationship with our employees generally to be satisfactory 

legal proceedings 

we are from time to time subject to and are presently involved in litigation or other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business based upon information currently known to us we believe the outcome of such proceedings will not have individually or in the aggregate a material adverse effect on our business our financial condition or results of operations 

available information 

td group’s annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k including any amendments will be made available free of charge on the company’s website wwwtransdigmcom  as soon as reasonably practicable following the filing of the reports with the securities and exchange commission 




 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below are important risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business and financial condition and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

our business is sensitive to the number of flight hours that our customers’ planes spend aloft the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and our customers’ profitability these items are in turn affected by general economic and geopolitical and other worldwide conditions 

our business is directly affected by among other factors changes in revenue passenger miles rpms the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and to a lesser extent changes in the profitability of the commercial airline industry rpms and airline profitability have historically been correlated with the general economic environment although national and international events also play a key role for example in the recent past the airline industry has been severely affected by the downturn in the global economy higher fuel prices the increased security concerns among airline customers following the events of september 11 2001 the severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars epidemic and the conflicts in afghanistan and iraq and could be impacted by future geopolitical or other worldwide conditions such as war terrorist acts or a worldwide infectious disease outbreak in addition global market and economic conditions have been challenging with continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies and have prolonged declines in business and consumer spending as a result of the substantial reduction in airline traffic resulting from these events the airline industry incurred large losses and financial difficulties some carriers have also parked or retired a portion of their fleets and have reduced workforces and flights during periods of reduced airline profitability some airlines may delay purchases of spare parts preferring instead to deplete existing inventories if demand for new aircraft and spare parts decreases there would be a decrease in demand for certain of our products 

our sales to manufacturers of aircraft are cyclical and a downturn in sales to these manufacturers may adversely affect us 

our sales to manufacturers of large commercial aircraft such as the boeing company airbus sas and related oem suppliers as well as manufacturers of business jets which accounted for approximately 24 of our net sales in fiscal year 2015 have historically experienced periodic downturns in the past these sales have been affected by airline profitability which is impacted by among other things fuel and labor costs price competition downturns in the global economy and national and international events such as the events of september 11 2001 in addition sales of our products to manufacturers of business jets are impacted by among other things downturns in the global economy downturns adversely affect our net sales gross margin and net income 

we rely heavily on certain customers for much of our sales 

our two largest customers for fiscal year 2015 were the boeing company which includes aviall inc a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world and airbus sas the boeing company accounted for approximately 12 of our net sales and airbus sas accounted for approximately 11 of our net sales in fiscal year 2015 our top ten customers for fiscal year 2015 accounted for approximately 46 of our net sales a material reduction in purchasing by one of our larger customers for any reason including but not limited to economic downturn decreased production strike or resourcing could have a material adverse effect on our net sales gross margin and net income 

we generally do not have guaranteed future sales of our products further when we enter into fixed price contracts with some of our customers we take the risk for cost overruns 

as is customary in our business we do not generally have longterm contracts with most of our aftermarket customers and therefore do not have guaranteed future sales although we have longterm contracts with many of our oem customers many of those customers may terminate the contracts on short notice and in most cases our customers have not committed to buy any minimum quantity of our products in addition in certain cases we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon the historic purchasing patterns of customers and upon our discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements and this anticipated future volume of orders may not materialize 

we also have entered into multiyear fixedprice contracts with some of our customers pursuant to which we have agreed to perform the work for a fixed price and accordingly realize all the benefit or detriment resulting from any decreases or increases in the costs of making these products sometimes we accept a fixedprice contract for a product that we have not yet produced and this increases the risk of cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product most of our contracts do not permit us to recover increases in raw material prices taxes or labor costs 

us military spending is dependent upon the us defense budget 

the military and defense market is significantly dependent upon government budget trends particularly the us department of defense the “dod” budget in addition to normal business risks our supply of products to the united states government is subject to unique risks largely beyond our control dod budgets could be negatively impacted by several factors including but not limited to a change in defense spending policy by the current presidential administration the us government’s budget deficits spending priorities the cost of sustaining the us military presence in the middle east and possible political pressure to reduce us government military spending each of which could cause the dod budget to remain 

unchanged or to decline a significant decline in us military expenditures could result in a reduction in the amount of our products sold to the various agencies and buying organizations of the us government 

we intend to pursue acquisitions our business may be adversely affected if we cannot consummate acquisitions on satisfactory terms or if we cannot effectively integrate acquired operations 

a significant portion of our growth has occurred through acquisitions any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions we intend to pursue acquisitions that we believe will present opportunities consistent with our overall business strategy however we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates to purchase or may be unable to acquire desired businesses or assets on economically acceptable terms in addition we may not be able to raise the capital necessary to fund future acquisitions because we may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously we may encounter unforeseen expenses complications and delays including regulatory complications or difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight 

we regularly engage in discussions with respect to potential acquisition and investment opportunities if we consummate an acquisition our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly future acquisitions could result in margin dilution and further likely result in the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest and amortization expenses or periodic impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets as well as significant charges relating to integration costs 

acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect in addition we may not be able to successfully integrate any business we acquire into our existing business the successful integration of new businesses depends on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs the successful integration of future acquisitions may also require substantial attention from our senior management and the management of the acquired business which could decrease the time that they have to service attract customers and develop new products and services or attend to other acquisition opportunities 

we are subject to certain unique business risks as a result of supplying equipment and services to the us government 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 

 most of our us government contracts can be terminated by the us government for its convenience without significant notice termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination 

on contracts for which the price is based on cost the us government may review our costs and performance as well as our accounting and general business practices based on the results of such audits the us government may adjust our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs in addition under us government purchasing regulations some of our costs including most financing costs amortization of intangible assets portions of research and development costs and certain marketing expenses may not be subject to reimbursement 

furthermore even where the price is not based on cost the us government may seek to review our costs to determine whether our pricing is “fair and reasonable” our subsidiaries are periodically subject to a pricing review such a review could be costly and time consuming for our management and could distract from our ability to effectively manage the business as a result of such a review we could be subject to providing a refund to the us government or we could be asked to enter into an arrangement whereby our prices would be based on cost or the dod could seek to pursue alternative sources of supply for our parts any of those occurrences could lead to a reduction in our revenue from or the profitability of certain of our supply arrangements with certain agencies and buying organizations of the us government 

moreover us government purchasing regulations contain a number of additional operation requirements which do not apply to entities not engaged in government contracting failure to comply with such government contracting requirements could result in civil and criminal penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations 

our business may be adversely affected if we would lose our government or industry approvals or if more stringent government regulations are enacted or if industry oversight is increased 

the aerospace industry is highly regulated in the united states and in other countries in order to sell our components we and the components we manufacture must be certified by the faa the dod and similar agencies in foreign countries and by individual manufacturers if new and more stringent government regulations are adopted or if industry oversight increases we might incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or heightened industry oversight in addition if material authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended our business would be adversely affected 

in addition to the aviation approvals we are at times required to obtain approval from us government agencies to export our products failure to obtain approval to export or determination by the us government that we failed to receive required approvals or licenses could eliminate or restrict our ability to sell our products outside the united states and the penalties that could be imposed by the us government for failure to comply with these laws could be significant 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and could harm our ability to react to changes to our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of september 30 2015  our total indebtedness was approximately 84273 million  which was approximately 1141  of our total book capitalization because of our prior year dividends being funded with indebtedness and the addition of approximately 954 million  in total debt in fiscal 2015  

in addition we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future for example as of september 30 2015  we had approximately 534 million  of unused commitments under our revolving loan facility and 50 million of unused capacity under our trade receivable securitization facility the “securitization facility” with the availability of the capacity under the securitization facility being dependent on the amount of our trade receivables outstanding although our senior secured credit facility and the indentures the “indentures” governing the 550 senior subordinated notes issued in october 2012 the “2020 notes” the 750 senior subordinated notes issued in july 2013 the “2021 notes” the 600 senior subordinated notes issued in june 2014 the “2022 notes the 650 senior subordinated notes issued june 2014 the “2024 notes” and the 650 senior subordinated notes issued may 2015 the “2025 notes” and together with the 2020 notes the 2021 notes the 2022 notes the 2024 notes the “notes” contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these qualifications and exceptions could be substantial if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage would increase 

our substantial debt could also have other important consequences to investors for example it could 

 in addition all of our debt under the senior secured credit facility which includes 4377 million  in term loans and a revolving loan facility of 550 million bears interest at floating rates accordingly if interest rates increase our debt service expense will also increase in order to reduce the floating interest rate risk as of september 30 2015  six  interest rate cap agreements beginning on september 30 2015 were in place to offset the variable interest rates based on an aggregate notional amount of 750 million  of debt under the senior secured credit facility also three forward starting interest rate swap agreements were in place that fix the interest on an aggregate notional amount of 1000 million of debt under the senior secured credit facility in addition we entered into five forward starting interest rate swap agreements that fix the interest beginning march 31 2016 on an aggregate notional amount of 750 million of debt under the senior secured credit facility 

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness including the notes we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital 

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness including the notes amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility amounts due under our securitization facility and to fund our operations will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future which to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness including the amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility amounts borrowed under our securitization facility and the notes or to fund our other liquidity needs if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital we cannot assure you that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations the terms of existing or future debt instruments the securitization facility the indentures and the senior secured credit facility may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives in addition any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms and would otherwise adversely affect the notes 

the terms of the senior secured credit facility and indentures may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

our senior secured credit facility and the indentures contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indentures and may limit their ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests the senior secured credit facility and indentures include covenants restricting among other things the ability of td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indentures to 

 a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the indentures if any such default occurs the lenders under the senior secured credit facility and the holders of the notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder to be immediately due and payable the lenders under the senior secured credit facility also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings in addition following an event of default under the senior secured credit facility the lenders under that facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which includes our available cash and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the notes if the debt under the senior secured credit facility or the notes were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations 

our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things discharges of pollutants into the air and water the generation handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees environmental laws and regulations may require that the company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations certain facilities and thirdparty sites utilized by subsidiaries of the company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws the company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws 

estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are based on current facts laws regulations and technology these estimates take into consideration the company’s prior experience and professional judgment of the company’s environmental advisors estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination the range of remediation alternatives available evolving remediation standards imprecise engineering evaluations and cost estimates the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 

accordingly as investigation and remediation proceed it is likely that adjustments in the company’s accruals will be necessary to reflect new information the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in a given period based on currently available information however the company does not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition 

environmental liabilities are recorded when the liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable which generally is not later than at completion of a feasibility study or when the company has recommended a remedy or has committed to an appropriate plan of action the liabilities are reviewed periodically and as investigation and remediation proceed adjustments are made as necessary liabilities for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not consider the effects of inflation and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value the liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties but do reflect anticipated allocations among potentially responsible parties at federal superfund sites or similar statemanaged sites third party indemnity obligations and an assessment of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their obligations at such sites 

we are dependent on our highly trained employees and any work stoppage or difficulty hiring similar employees could adversely affect our business 

because our products are complicated and highly engineered we depend on an educated and trained workforce there is substantial competition for skilled personnel in the aircraft component industry and we could be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled employees we may not be able to fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover or attract and retain qualified personnel 

as of september 30 2015 we had approximately 8200 fulltime parttime and temporary employees approximately 8 of our fulltime and parttime employees were represented by labor unions collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire at various dates ranging from april 2016 to may 2018 we consider our relationship with our employees generally to be satisfactory although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory we cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory renewal of these collective bargaining agreements or that our employee relations will remain stable because we maintain a relatively small inventory of finished goods any work stoppage could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide products to our customers 

our business is dependent on the availability of certain components and raw materials from suppliers 

our business is affected by the price and availability of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our components our business therefore could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our suppliers such as the destruction of our suppliers’ facilities or their distribution infrastructure a work stoppage or strike by our suppliers’ employees or the failure of our suppliers to provide materials of the requisite quality or by increased costs of such raw materials or components if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers because we maintain a relatively small inventory of raw materials and component parts our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers or alternative raw materials or component parts the lengthy and expensive faa and oem certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier raw material or component part 

our facilities are located near known earthquake fault zones and hurricane paths and the occurrence of a natural disaster could cause damage to our facilities and equipment which could require us to curtail or cease operations 

a number of our manufacturing facilities are located in the greater los angeles area an area known for earthquakes and are thus vulnerable to damage in addition a number of our manufacturing facilities are located along the eastern seaboard area susceptible to hurricanes we are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters including power loss fire explosions floods communications failures terrorist attacks and similar events disruptions could also occur due to cyberattacks computer or equipment malfunction accidental or intentional operator error or process failures any disruption of our ability to operate our business could result in a material decrease in our revenues or significant additional costs to replace repair or insure our assets which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

operations and sales outside of the united states may be subject to additional risks 

a number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including currency fluctuations difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies restrictions on the repatriation of funds change in trade policies tariff regulation difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition furthermore the company is subject to laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act or similar local antibribery laws which generally prohibit companies and their employees agents and contractors from making improper payments to governmental officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure to comply with these laws could subject the company to civil and criminal penalties that could materially adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

we face significant competition 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry and compete against a number of companies competitors in our product lines are both us and foreign companies and range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privately held entities we believe that our ability to compete depends on high product performance consistent high quality short leadtime and timely delivery competitive pricing superior customer service and support and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs we may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive 

we could be adversely affected if one of our components causes an aircraft to crash 

our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we have designed manufactured or serviced while we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future product liability claims in the event of product liability claims our insurers may attempt to deny coverage or any coverage we have may not be adequate we also may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost any liability not covered by insurance or for which third party indemnification is not available could result in significant liability to us 

in addition a crash caused by one of our components could damage our reputation for quality products we believe our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting a provider of aircraft components if a crash were to be caused by one of our components or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of data protection concerns 

the interpretation and application of data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are uncertain and evolving it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices compliance could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

in addition despite our efforts to protect confidential information our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to data loss including cyberattacks this could lead to negative publicity legal claims theft modification or destruction of proprietary or key information damage to or inaccessibility of critical systems manufacture of defective products production downtimes operational disruptions and other significant costs which could adversely affect our reputation financial condition and results of operations 

we have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets which may never generate the returns we expect 

mergers and acquisitions have resulted in significant increases in identifiable intangible assets and goodwill identifiable intangible assets which primarily include trademarks trade names trade secrets and technology were approximately 15399 million  at september 30 2015  representing approximately 183  of our total assets goodwill recognized in accounting for the mergers and acquisitions was approximately 46862 million  at september 30 2015  representing approximately 556  of our total assets we may never realize the full value of our identifiable intangible assets and goodwill and to the extent we were to 

determine that our identifiable intangible assets or our goodwill were impaired within the meaning of applicable accounting standards we would be required to writeoff the amount of any impairment 

our stock price may be volatile and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 

there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities which is unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities these broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the purchase price due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects including possible changes due to the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry and other factors such as fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering which could cause shortterm swings in profit margins or unrelated to our operating performance including market conditions affecting the stock market generally or the stocks of aerospace companies more specifically 

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our share price 

we may sell additional shares of common stock into the public markets or issue convertible debt securities to raise capital in the future the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public markets or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities to raise capital at a time and price that we deem appropriate 

our corporate documents and delaware law contain certain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable for example our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 149600000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock without stockholder approval the board of directors has the authority to attach special rights including voting and dividend rights to this preferred stock with these rights holders of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75 of the voting power of our issued and outstanding capital stock voting together as a single class is required for the alteration amendment or repeal of certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and certain provisions of our amended and restated bylaws including the provisions relating to our stockholders’ ability to call special meetings notice provisions for stockholder business to be conducted at an annual meeting requests for stockholder lists and corporate records nomination and removal of directors and filling of vacancies on our board of directors 

we are also subject to the antitakeover provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law under these provisions if anyone becomes an “interested stockholder” we may not enter into a “business combination” with that person for three years without special approval which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change of control for purposes of section 203 “interested stockholder” means generally someone owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years subject to certain exceptions as described in section 203 

we do not pay regular quarterly or annual cash dividends on our stock 

on october 15 2012 july 3 2013 and june 4 2014 the company’s board of directors authorized and declared special cash dividends of 1285 2200 and 2500 respectively on each outstanding share of common stock and cash dividend equivalent payments to holders of options under its stock option plans 

notwithstanding the special cash dividends paid in october 2012 july 2013 and june 2014 we do not anticipate declaring or paying regular quarterly or annual cash dividends on our common stock or any other equity security in the foreseeable future the amounts that may be available to us to pay future special cash dividends are restricted under our debt and other agreements any payment of special cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations earnings capital requirements financial condition future prospects contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors therefore you should not rely on regular quarterly or annual dividend income from shares of our common stock and you should not rely on special dividends with any regularity or at all

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected financial data” and td group’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report the following discussion may contain predictions estimates and other forwardlooking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties including those discussed under the heading entitled “risk factors” included elsewhere in this report these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 

overview 

we believe we are a leading global designer producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers some of our more significant product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and engine technology specialized pumps and valves power conditioning devices specialized acdc electric motors and generators nicad batteries and chargers engineered latching and locking devices rods and locking devices engineered connectors and elastomers cockpit security components and systems specialized cockpit displays aircraft audio systems specialized lavatory components seat belts and safety restraints engineered interior surfaces and related components lighting and control technology military personnel parachutes and cargo loading handling and delivery systems each of these product offerings is composed of many individual products that are typically customized to meet the needs of a particular aircraft platform or customer 

longterm sustainable growth 

for fiscal year 2015 we generated net sales of 27071 million  gross profit of 14498 million  or 536 of sales and net income of 4472 million  we believe we have achieved steady longterm growth in sales and improvements in operating performance since our formation in 1993 due to our competitive strengths and through execution of our valuedriven operating strategy more specifically focusing our businesses on our valuedriven operating strategy of obtaining profitable new business carefully controlling the cost structure and pricing our highly engineered valueadded products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so has historically resulted in improvements in gross profit and income from operations over the long term 

our selective acquisition strategy has also contributed to the growth of our business the integration of certain acquisitions into our existing businesses combined with implementing our proven operating strategy has historically resulted in improvements of the financial performance of the acquired business 

our key competitive strengths and the elements of our business strategy are set forth in more detail below 

we believe our key competitive strengths include 

large and growing installed product base with aftermarket revenue stream  we provide components to a large and growing installed base of aircraft to which we supply aftermarket products we estimate that our products are installed on approximately 95000 commercial transport regional transport military and general aviation fixed wing turbine aircraft and rotary wing aircraft 

diversified revenue base  we believe that our diversified revenue base reduces our dependence on any particular product platform or market channel and has been a significant factor in maintaining our financial performance our products are installed on almost all of the major commercial aircraft platforms now in production we expect to continue to develop new products for military and commercial applications 

significant barriers to entry  we believe that the niche nature of our markets the industry’s stringent regulatory and certification requirements the large number of products that we sell and the investments necessary to develop and certify products create barriers to entry for potential competitors 

our business strategy is made up of two key elements 1 a valuedriven operating strategy focused around our three core value drivers and 2 a selective acquisition strategy 

valuedriven operating strategy  our three core value drivers are 

 25 

 selective acquisition strategy  we selectively pursue the acquisition of proprietary aerospace component businesses when we see an opportunity to create value through the application of our three core valuedriven operating strategies the aerospace industry in particular remains highly fragmented with many of the companies in the industry being small private businesses or small noncore operations of larger businesses we have significant experience among our management team in executing acquisitions and integrating acquired businesses into our company and culture as of the date of this report we have successfully acquired 55 businesses andor product lines since our formation in 1993 many of these acquisitions have been integrated into an existing transdigm production facility which enables a higher production capacity utilization which in turn improves gross profit levels due to the ability to spread the fixed manufacturing overhead costs over higher production volume 

acquisitions and divestitures during the previous three fiscal years are more fully described in note 2 “acquisitions” in the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein

 trend information 

we predominantly serve customers in the commercial regional business jet and general aviation aftermarket which accounts for approximately 37 of total sales the commercial aerospace oem market comprising large commercial transport manufacturers and regional and business jet manufacturers which accounts for approximately 29 of total sales and the defense market which accounts for approximately 29 of total sales nonaerospace sales comprise approximately 5 of our total sales 

the commercial aerospace industry including the aftermarket and oem market is impacted by the health of the global economy and geopolitical events around the world the commercial aerospace industry had shown strength with increases in revenue passenger miles or rpms between 2003 and 2008 as well as increases in oem production and backlog however in 2009 the global economic downturn negatively impacted the commercial aerospace industry causing rpms to decline slightly this market sector began to rebound in 2010 and positive growth has continued thru 2015 with increases in rpms as well as the growth in the large commercial oem sector aircraft with 100 or more seats with order announcements by the boeing company and airbus sas leading to planned increases in production the 2016 leading indicators and industry consensus suggest a continuation of current trends in the commercial transport market sector supported by continued rpm growth and increases in production at the oem level 

the defense aerospace market is dependent on government budget constraints the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts it is not necessarily affected by general economic conditions that affect the commercial aerospace industry 

our presence in both the commercial aerospace and military sectors of the aerospace industry may mitigate the impact on our business of any specific industry risk we service a diversified customer base in the commercial and military aerospace industry and we provide components to a diverse installed base of aircraft which mitigates our exposure to any individual airframe platform at times declines in sales in one channel have been offset by increased sales in another however due to differences between the profitability of our products sold to oem and aftermarket customers variation in product mix can cause variation in gross margin 

there are many shortterm factors including inventory corrections unannounced changes in order patterns strikes and mergers and acquisitions that can cause shortterm disruptions in our quarterly shipment patterns as compared to previous quarters and the same periods in prior years as such it can be difficult to determine longerterm trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons to normalize for shortterm fluctuations we tend to look at our performance over several quarters or years of activity rather than discrete shortterm periods 

there are also fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering and delivery requests from quartertoquarter as well as variations in product mix from quartertoquarter that may cause positive or negative variations in gross profit margins since commercial aftermarket sales have historically produced a higher gross margin than sales to commercial oems again in many instances these are timing events between quarters and must be balanced with macro aerospace industry indicators 

commercial aftermarket 

the key growth factors in the commercial aftermarket include worldwide rpms and the size and activity level of the worldwide fleet of aircraft after a decline in rpms in 2009 worldwide rpms returned to growth between 2010 and 2015 and current industry consensus indicates that positive rpm growth will continue in 2016 

commercial oem market 

the commercial transport market sector the largest sector in the commercial oem market continued to grow during 2015 our commercial transport oem shipments and revenues generally run ahead of the boeing and airbus airframe delivery schedules as a result and consistent with prior years our fiscal 2016 shipments will be a function of among other things the estimated 2016 and 2017 commercial airframe production rates we have been experiencing increased sales in the large commercial oem sector aircraft with 100 or more seats driven by an increase in production by the boeing company and airbus sas tied to previous order announcements industry consensus indicates this production increase will continue in 2016 and 2017 though the growth may moderate and begin to flatten 

defense 

our military business fluctuates from year to year and is dependent to a degree on government budget constraints the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts in recent years defense spending has reached historic highs due in part to the military engagements in afghanistan and iraq and the war on terrorism for a variety of reasons the military spending outlook is very uncertain for planning purposes we assume that military related sales of our types of products to be flat in future years over the recent high levels 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations however investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 

below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions for additional accounting policies see note 3 “summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein 

revenue recognition and related allowances  revenue is recognized from the sale of products when title and risk of loss passes to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment substantially all product sales are made pursuant to firm fixedprice purchase orders received from customers collectibility of amounts recorded as revenue is reasonably assured at the time of sale provisions for returns uncollectible accounts and the cost of repairs under contract warranty provisions are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are principally based on historical results modified as appropriate by the most current information available we have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of such allowances however due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process it is possible that actual results may vary from the estimates and the differences could be material 

management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable and customer creditworthiness the allowance also incorporates a provision for the estimated impact of disputes with customers management’s estimate of the allowance amounts that are necessary includes amounts for specifically identified credit losses and estimated credit losses based on historical information the determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to significant levels of judgment and estimation by management depending on the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues or if the financial condition of any of the company’s customers were to deteriorate and their ability to make required payments were to become impaired increases in these allowances may be required historically changes in estimates in the allowance for doubtful accounts have not been significant 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost of inventories is generally determined by the average cost and the firstin firstout fifo methods and includes material labor and overhead related to the manufacturing process because the company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be inservice for 25 or more years it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use where management estimated that the current market value was below cost or determined that future demand was lower than current inventory levels based on historical experience current and projected market demand current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value was made by recording a provision included in cost of sales although management believes that the company’s estimates of excess and obsolete inventory are reasonable actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future in addition in accordance with industry practice all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year historically changes in estimates in the net realizable value of inventories have not been significant 

intangible assets  mergers and acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method and have resulted in significant amounts of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill fair value adjustments to the company’s assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition we generally use thirdparty appraisals to assist us in determining the estimated fair value of the intangible assets 

intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights or if the intangible asset can be sold transferred licensed or exchanged regardless of the company’s intent to do so goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition and are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates 

gaap requires that the annual and any interim impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level the reporting unit level is one level below an operating segment substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each reporting unit pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction with respect to acquisitions integrated into an existing reporting unit any acquired goodwill is combined with the goodwill of the reporting unit 

at the time of goodwill impairment testing management determines the estimated fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit if the calculated estimated fair value is less than the current carrying value impairment of goodwill of the reporting unit may exist the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing includes discount rates growth rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates are set by using the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” methodology the wacc methodology considers market and industry data as well as company specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business 

management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates as an indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately through the use of the discounted cash flow valuation model the aggregate of all reporting unit’s estimated fair value is reconciled to the total market capitalization of the company 

the company had 29 reporting units with goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 the date of the last annual impairment test the estimated fair values of each of the reporting units was substantially in excess of their respective carrying values and therefore no goodwill impairment was recorded the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate which is a significant assumption in the calculation of fair values with a one percentage point increase in the discount rate the reporting units would continue to have fair values in excess of their respective carrying values 

management tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at the asset level as determined by appropriate asset valuation at the time of acquisition the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets consists of a comparison between the estimated fair values and carrying values if the carrying amounts of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives exceed their estimated fair values an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference management utilizes the royalty savings valuation method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset in this method management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset the key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates royalty rates growth rates sales projections and terminal value rates discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the wacc methodology considering any differences in companyspecific risk factors between reporting units and the indefinitelived intangible assets royalty rates are established by management with the advice of valuation experts and periodically substantiated by valuation experts management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant intangible asset terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates 

the discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed actual results could differ from these assumptions management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering the current economic conditions 

income taxes  the company estimates income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates this involves estimating taxable earnings specific taxable and deductible items the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits to the extent these estimates change adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes are made in the period in which the changes occur historically such adjustments have not been significant 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain operating data of the company including presentation of the amounts as a percentage of net sales amounts in thousands

total company 

net sales  net organic sales and acquisition sales and the related dollar and percentage changes for the fiscal years ended september 30 2015  and 2014  were as follows amounts in millions 



acquisition sales represent sales of acquired businesses for the period up to one year subsequent to their acquisition dates the amount of acquisition sales shown in the table above was attributable to the acquisitions of telair cargo group adams rite aerospace gmbh pexco aerospace and pneudraulics in fiscal 2015  and airborne and eme in fiscal 2014  

commercial aftermarket sales increased 369 million or an increase of 42 defense sales increased 298 million or an increase of 43 and commercial oem sales increased 164 million or an increase of 24 for the fiscal year ended september 30 2015  compared to the fiscal year ended september 30 2014  

cost of sales and gross profit  cost of sales increased by 1523 million  or 138  to 12573 million  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2015  compared to 11050 million  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2014  cost of sales and the related percentage of total sales for the fiscal years ended september 30 2015  and 2014  were as follows amounts in millions

foreign operations 

although we manufacture a significant portion of our products in the united states we manufacture some products in belgium china germany hungary malaysia mexico norway sri lanka sweden and the united kingdom although the majority of sales of our products are made to customers including distributors located in the united states our products are ultimately sold to and used by customers including airlines and other end users of aircraft throughout the world a number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including currency fluctuations difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies restrictions on the repatriation of funds change in trade policies tariff regulation difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically maintained a capital structure comprising a mix of equity and debt financing we vary our leverage both to optimize our equity return and to pursue acquisitions we expect to meet our current debt obligations as they come due through internally generated funds from current levels of operations andor through refinancing in the debt or equity markets prior to the maturity dates of our debt 

we continually evaluate our debt facilities to assess whether they most efficiently and effectively meet the current and future needs of our business the company evaluates from time to time the appropriateness of its current leverage taking into consideration the company’s debt holders equity holders credit ratings acquisition opportunities and other factors the company’s debt leverage ratio which is computed as total debt divided by ebitda as defined for the applicable twelvemonth period has varied widely during the company’s history ranging from approximately 35 to 70 our debt leverage ratio at september 30 2015  was approximately 68  

the company regularly engages in discussions with respect to potential acquisitions and investments however there can be no assurance that the company will be able to consummate an agreement with respect to any future acquisition the company’s acquisition strategy may require substantial capital and no assurance can be given that the company will be able to raise any necessary funds on acceptable terms or at all if the company incurs additional debt to finance acquisitions total interest expense will increase 

if the company has excess cash it may consider methods by which it can provide cash to its debt or equity holders through a dividend prepayment of indebtedness repurchase of stock repurchase of debt or other means whether the company undertakes additional stock repurchases or other aforementioned activities will depend on prevailing market conditions the company’s liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material in addition the company may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so 

the company’s ability to make scheduled interest payments on or to refinance the company’s indebtedness or to fund nonacquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on the company’s ability to generate cash in the future this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control based on its current levels of operations and absent any disruptive events management believes that internally generated funds and borrowings available under our revolving loan facility should provide sufficient resources to finance its operations nonacquisition related capital expenditures research and development efforts and longterm indebtedness obligations through at least fiscal 2016 there can be no assurance however that the company’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to the company under the senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its indebtedness or to fund its other liquidity needs the company may need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness on or before maturity also to the extent the company accelerates its growth plans consummates acquisitions or has lower than anticipated sales or increases in expenses the company may also need to raise additional capital in particular increased working capital needs occur whenever the company consummates acquisitions or experiences strong incremental demand there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the company has not at this time determined to change the nature of its debt facilities however in the future the company may increase its borrowings in connection with acquisitions if cash flow from operations becomes insufficient to fund current operations or for other shortterm cash needs or for stock repurchases or dividends our future leverage will also be impacted by the then current conditions of the credit markets

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

most of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue once our parts are designed into and sold on a new aircraft we generate net sales from aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft which is generally estimated to be approximately 2530 years a typical platform can be produced for 20 to 30 years giving us an estimated product life cycle in excess of 50 years we estimate that approximately 55 of our net sales in fiscal year 2014 were generated from aftermarket sales the vast majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets these aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and been more stable than sales to original equipment manufacturers or oems 

products 

we primarily design produce and supply highlyengineered proprietary aerospace components and certain systemssubsystems with significant aftermarket content we seek to develop highly customized products to solve specific needs for aircraft operators and manufacturers we attempt to differentiate ourselves based on 

  

engineering service and manufacturing capabilities we typically choose not to compete for nonproprietary “build to print” business because it frequently offers lower margins than proprietary products we believe that our products have strong brand names within the industry and that we have a reputation for high quality reliability and customer support 

our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products that we offer to our customers some of our more significant product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and engine technology specialized pumps and valves power conditioning devices specialized acdc electric motors and generators nicad batteries and chargers engineered latching and locking devices rods and locking devices engineered connectors and elastomers cockpit security components and systems specialized cockpit displays aircraft audio systems specialized lavatory components seatbelts and safety restraints engineered interior surfaces lighting and control technology and military personnel parachutes and cargo delivery systems 

segments 

the company’s businesses are organized and managed in three reporting segments power  control airframe and nonaviation 

the power  control segment includes operations that primarily develop produce and market systems and components that predominately provide power to or control power of the aircraft utilizing electronic fluid power and mechanical motion control technologies major product offerings include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and engine technology specialized pumps and valves power conditioning devices and specialized acdc electric motors and generators primary customers of this segment are engine and power system and subsystem suppliers airlines third party maintenance suppliers military buying agencies and repair depots products are sold in the original equipment and aftermarket market channels 

the airframe segment includes operations that primarily develop produce and market systems and components that are used in nonpower airframe applications utilizing airframe and cabin structure technologies major product offerings include engineered latching and locking devices rods and locking devices engineered connectors and elastomers cockpit security components and systems aircraft audio systems specialized lavatory components seatbelts and safety restraints engineered interior surfaces lighting and control technology military personnel parachutes and cargo aerial delivery systems primary customers of this segment are airframe manufacturers and cabin system suppliers and subsystem suppliers airlines third party maintenance suppliers military buying agencies and repair depots products are sold in the original equipment and aftermarket market channels 

the nonaviation segment includes operations that primarily develop produce and market products for nonaviation markets major product offerings include seatbelts and safety restraints for ground transportation applications mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls for space applications and refueling systems for heavy equipment used in mining construction and other industries primary customers of this segment are off road vehicle suppliers and subsystem suppliers child restraint system suppliers satellite and space system suppliers and manufacturers of heavy equipment used in mining construction and other industries 

for financial information about our segments see note 16 “segments” to our consolidated financial statements 

sales and marketing 

consistent with our overall strategy our sales and marketing organization is structured to continually develop technical solutions that meet customer needs in particular we attempt to focus on products and programs that will lead to highmargin repeatable sales in the aftermarket 

  

we have structured our sales efforts along our major product offerings assigning a product manager to certain products each product manager is expected to grow the sales and profitability of the products for which he or she is responsible and to achieve the targeted annual level of bookings sales new business and profitability for such products the product managers are assisted by account managers and sales engineers who are responsible for covering major oem and aftermarket accounts account managers and sales engineers are expected to be familiar with the personnel organization and needs of specific customers to achieve total bookings and new business goals at each account and together with the product managers to determine when additional resources are required at customer locations most of our sales personnel are evaluated in part on their bookings and their ability to identify and obtain new business opportunities 

though typically performed by employees the account manager function may be performed by independent representatives depending on the specific customer product and geographic location we also use a number of distributors to provide logistical support as well as primary customer contact with certain smaller accounts our major distributors are aviall inc a subsidiary of the boeing company and satair as a subsidiary of airbus sas 

manufacturing and engineering 

we maintain 42 principal manufacturing facilities most of our manufacturing facilities are comprised of manufacturing distribution and engineering functions and most facilities have certain administrative functions including management sales and finance we continually strive to improve productivity and reduce costs including rationalization of operations developing improved control systems that allow for accurate product profit and loss accounting investing in equipment tooling information systems and implementing broadbased employee training programs management believes that our manufacturing systems and equipment contribute to our ability to compete by permitting us to meet the rigorous tolerances and cost sensitive price structure of aircraft component customers 

we attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by producing uniquely engineered products with high quality and timely delivery our engineering costs are recorded in cost of sales and in selling and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income total engineering expense represents approximately 7 of our operating units’ aggregate costs or approximately 4 of our consolidated net sales our proprietary products and particularly our new product initiatives are designed by our engineers and are intended to serve the needs of the aircraft component industry these proprietary designs must withstand the extraordinary conditions and stresses that will be endured by products during use and meet the rigorous demands of our customers’ tolerance and quality requirements 

we use sophisticated equipment and procedures to comply with quality requirements specifications and federal aviation administration “faa” and oem requirements we perform a variety of testing procedures including testing under different temperature humidity and altitude levels shock and vibration testing and xray fluorescent measurement these procedures together with other customer approved techniques for document process and quality control are used throughout our manufacturing facilities 

customers 

our customers include 1 distributors of aerospace components 2 worldwide commercial airlines including national and regional airlines 3 large commercial transport and regional and business aircraft oems 4 various armed forces of the united states and friendly foreign governments 5 defense oems 6 system suppliers and 7 various other industrial customers for the year ended september 30 2014 boeing which includes aviall inc a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world accounted for approximately 13 of our net sales our top ten customers for fiscal year 2014 accounted for approximately 43 of our net sales products supplied to many of our customers are used on multiple platforms 

active commercial production programs include the boeing 737 747 767 777 and 787 the airbus a3192021 a330a340 a350 and a380 the bombardier crj’s challenger and learjets the embraer rj’s the 

  

cessna citation family the raytheon premier and hawker and most gulfstream airframes military platforms include aircraft such as the boeing c17 f15 f18 and v22 the airbus a400m the lockheed martin c130j f16 and f35 joint strikefighter the northrop grumman e2c hawkeye the sikorsky uh60 helicopter ch47 chinook and ah64 apache helicopters the general atomics predator drone and the raytheon patriot missile transdigm has been awarded numerous contracts for the development of engineered products for production on the airbus a320 neo the boeing 737 max the sikorsky s97 jmr helicopter and boeing p8 poseidon 

the demand for our aftermarket parts and services depends on among other things the breadth of our installed oem base revenue passenger miles “rpms” the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and to a lesser extent airline profitability we believe that we are also a leading supplier of components used on us designed military aircraft including components that are used on a variety of fighter aircraft military freighters and military helicopters 

competition 

the niche markets within the aerospace industry that we serve are relatively fragmented and we face several competitors for many of the products and services we provide due to the global nature of the commercial aircraft industry competition in these categories comes from both us and foreign companies competitors in our product offerings range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privatelyheld entities with only one or two components in their entire product portfolios 

we compete on the basis of engineering manufacturing and marketing high quality products which we believe meet or exceed the performance and maintenance requirements of our customers consistent and timely delivery and superior customer service and support the industry’s stringent regulatory certification and technical requirements and the investments necessary in the development and certification of products create barriers to entry for potential new competitors as long as customers receive products that meet or exceed expectations and performance standards we believe that they will have a reduced incentive to certify another supplier because of the cost and time of the technical design and testing certification process in addition we believe that the availability dependability and safety of our products are reasons for our customers to continue longterm supplier relationships 

government contracts 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 1 suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations 2 terminate existing contracts 3 reduce the value of existing contracts 4 audit our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs and 5 control and potentially prohibit the export of our products 

governmental regulation 

the commercial aircraft component industry is highly regulated by the faa in the united states and by the joint aviation authorities in europe and other agencies throughout the world while the military aircraft component industry is governed by military quality specifications we and the components we manufacture are required to be certified by one or more of these entities or agencies and in many cases by individual oems in order to engineer and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models 

we must also satisfy the requirements of our customers including oems and airlines that are subject to faa regulations and provide these customers with products and services that comply with the government regulations applicable to commercial flight operations in addition the faa requires that various maintenance 

  

routines be performed on aircraft components we believe that we currently satisfy or exceed these maintenance standards in our repair and overhaul services we also maintain several faa approved repair stations 

in addition sales of many of our products that will be used on aircraft owned by nonus entities are subject to compliance with us export control laws 

raw materials 

we require the use of various raw materials in our manufacturing processes we also purchase a variety of manufactured component parts from various suppliers at times we concentrate our orders among a few suppliers in order to strengthen our supplier relationships most of our raw materials and component parts are generally available from multiple suppliers at competitive prices 

intellectual property 

we have various trade secrets proprietary information trademarks trade names patents copyrights and other intellectual property rights which we believe in the aggregate but not individually are important to our business 

backlog 

as of september 30 2014 the company estimated its sales order backlog at 1195 million compared to an estimated sales order backlog of 1081 million as of september 30 2013 the increase in estimated sales order backlog of approximately 114 million is primarily due to acquisitions the majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of september 30 2014 are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months purchase orders may be subject to cancellation or deferral by the customer prior to shipment the level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of the company’s receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled accordingly the company’s backlog as of september 30 2014 may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period 

foreign operations 

although we manufacture a significant portion of our products in the united states we manufacture some products in belgium china malaysia mexico sri lanka and the united kingdom although the majority of sales of our products are made to customers including distributors located in the united states our products are ultimately sold to and used by customers including airlines and other end users of aircraft throughout the world a number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including currency fluctuations difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies restrictions on the repatriation of funds change in trade policies tariff regulation difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition 

our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately 7359 million 5720 million and 5088 million for fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks including the impact of foreign government regulations political uncertainties and differences in business practices there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments’ countries furthermore there can be no assurance that the political cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 

  

environmental matters 

our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things discharges of pollutants into the air and water the generation handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees environmental laws and regulations may require that the company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations certain facilities and thirdparty sites utilized by subsidiaries of the company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws the company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws 

estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are based on current facts laws regulations and technology these estimates take into consideration the company’s prior experience and professional judgment of the company’s environmental advisors estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination the range of remediation alternatives available evolving remediation standards imprecise engineering evaluations and cost estimates the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 

accordingly as investigation and remediation proceed it is likely that adjustments in the company’s accruals will be necessary to reflect new information the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in a given period based on currently available information however the company does not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition 

environmental liabilities are recorded when the liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable which generally is not later than at completion of a feasibility study or when the company has recommended a remedy or has committed to an appropriate plan of action the liabilities are reviewed periodically and as investigation and remediation proceed adjustments are made as necessary liabilities for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not consider the effects of inflation and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value the liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties but do reflect anticipated allocations among potentially responsible parties at federal superfund sites or similar statemanaged sites third party indemnity obligations and an assessment of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their obligations at such sites 

employees 

as of september 30 2014 we had approximately 7300 full time part time and temporary employees approximately 11 of our full time and part time employees were represented by labor unions collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire at various dates ranging from february 2015 to may 2018 we consider our relationship with our employees generally to be satisfactory 

legal proceedings 

we are from time to time subject to and are presently involved in litigation or other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business based upon information currently known to us we believe the outcome of such proceedings will not have individually or in the aggregate a material adverse effect on our business our financial condition or results of operations

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend set forth below are important risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business and financial condition and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

our business is sensitive to the number of flight hours that our customers’ planes spend aloft the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and our customers’ profitability these items are in turn affected by general economic and geopolitical and other worldwide conditions 

our business is directly affected by among other factors changes in revenue passenger miles rpms the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and to a lesser extent changes in the profitability of the commercial airline industry rpms and airline profitability have historically been correlated with the general economic environment although national and international events also play a key role for example in the recent past the airline industry has been severely affected by the downturn in the global economy higher fuel prices the increased security concerns among airline customers following the events of september 11 2001 the severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars epidemic and the conflicts in afghanistan and iraq and could be impacted by future geopolitical or other worldwide conditions such as war terrorist acts or a worldwide infectious disease outbreak in addition global market and economic conditions have been challenging with continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies and have prolonged declines in business and consumer spending as a result of the substantial reduction in airline traffic resulting from these events the airline industry incurred large losses and financial difficulties some carriers have also parked or retired a portion of their fleets and have reduced workforces and flights during periods of reduced airline profitability some airlines may delay purchases of spare parts preferring instead to deplete existing inventories if demand for new aircraft and spare parts decreases there would be a decrease in demand for certain of our products 

our sales to manufacturers of aircraft are cyclical and a downturn in sales to these manufacturers may adversely affect us 

our sales to manufacturers of large commercial aircraft such as the boeing company airbus sas and related oem suppliers as well as manufacturers of business jets which accounted for approximately 26 of our net sales in fiscal year 2014 have historically experienced periodic downturns in the past these sales have been affected by airline profitability which is impacted by among other things fuel and labor costs price competition downturns in the global economy and national and international events such as the events of september 11 2001 in addition sales of our products to manufacturers of business jets are impacted by among other things downturns in the global economy downturns adversely affect our net sales gross margin and net income 

we rely heavily on certain customers for much of our sales 

our largest customer for fiscal year 2014 was the boeing company which includes aviall inc a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world boeing accounted for approximately 13 of our net sales in fiscal year 2014 our top ten customers for fiscal year 2014 accounted for 

approximately 43 of our net sales a material reduction in purchasing by one of our larger customers for any reason including but not limited to economic downturn decreased production strike or resourcing could have a material adverse effect on our net sales gross margin and net income 

  

we generally do not have guaranteed future sales of our products further when we enter into fixed price contracts with some of our customers we take the risk for cost overruns 

as is customary in our business we do not generally have longterm contracts with most of our aftermarket customers and therefore do not have guaranteed future sales although we have longterm contracts with many of our oem customers many of those customers may terminate the contracts on short notice and in most cases our customers have not committed to buy any minimum quantity of our products in addition in certain cases we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon the historic purchasing patterns of customers and upon our discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements and this anticipated future volume of orders may not materialize 

we also have entered into multiyear fixedprice contracts with some of our customers pursuant to which we have agreed to perform the work for a fixed price and accordingly realize all the benefit or detriment resulting from any decreases or increases in the costs of making these products sometimes we accept a fixedprice contract for a product that we have not yet produced and this increases the risk of cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product most of our contracts do not permit us to recover increases in raw material prices taxes or labor costs 

us military spending is dependent upon the us defense budget 

the military and defense market is significantly dependent upon government budget trends particularly the us department of defense the “dod” budget in addition to normal business risks our supply of products to the united states government is subject to unique risks largely beyond our control dod budgets could be negatively impacted by several factors including but not limited to a change in defense spending policy by the current presidential administration the us government’s budget deficits spending priorities the cost of sustaining the us military presence in the middle east and possible political pressure to reduce us government military spending each of which could cause the dod budget to remain unchanged or to decline a significant decline in us military expenditures could result in a reduction in the amount of our products sold to the various agencies and buying organizations of the us government 

we intend to pursue acquisitions our business may be adversely affected if we cannot consummate acquisitions on satisfactory terms or if we cannot effectively integrate acquired operations 

a significant portion of our growth has occurred through acquisitions any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions we intend to pursue acquisitions that we believe will present opportunities consistent with our overall business strategy however we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates to purchase or may be unable to acquire desired businesses or assets on economically acceptable terms in addition we may not be able to raise the capital necessary to fund future acquisitions because we may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously we may encounter unforeseen expenses complications and delays including regulatory complications or difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight 

we regularly engage in discussions with respect to potential acquisition and investment opportunities if we consummate an acquisition our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly future acquisitions could result in margin dilution and further likely result in the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest and amortization expenses or periodic impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets as well as significant charges relating to integration costs 

acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect in addition we may not be able to successfully integrate any business we acquire into our existing business the successful integration of new businesses depends on our ability to manage these new businesses 

  

and cut excess costs the successful integration of future acquisitions may also require substantial attention from our senior management and the management of the acquired business which could decrease the time that they have to service attract customers and develop new products and services or attend to other acquisition opportunities 

we are subject to certain unique business risks as a result of supplying equipment and services to the us government 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 

 

  

  

  

 most of our us government contracts can be terminated by the us government for its convenience without significant notice termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination 

on contracts for which the price is based on cost the us government may review our costs and performance as well as our accounting and general business practices based on the results of such audits the us government may adjust our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs in addition under us government purchasing regulations some of our costs including most financing costs amortization of intangible assets portions of research and development costs and certain marketing expenses may not be subject to reimbursement 

in addition even where the price is not based on cost the us government may seek to review our costs to determine whether our pricing is “fair and reasonable” five of our subsidiaries and divisions were subject to such a pricing review for years 2002 through 2004 and it is possible that we will be subject to a similar pricing review in the future such a review could be costly and time consuming for our management and could distract from our ability to effectively manage the business as a result of such a review we could be subject to providing a refund to the us government or we could be asked to enter into an arrangement whereby our prices would be based on cost or the dod could seek to pursue alternative sources of supply for our parts any of those occurrences could lead to a reduction in our revenue from or the profitability of certain of our supply arrangements with certain agencies and buying organizations of the us government 

our business may be adversely affected if we would lose our government or industry approvals or if more stringent government regulations are enacted or if industry oversight is increased 

the aerospace industry is highly regulated in the united states and in other countries in order to sell our components we and the components we manufacture must be certified by the faa the dod and similar agencies in foreign countries and by individual manufacturers if new and more stringent government regulations are adopted or if industry oversight increases we might incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or heightened industry oversight in addition if material authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended our business would be adversely affected 

in addition to the aviation approvals we are at times required to obtain approval from us government agencies to export our products failure to obtain approval to export or determination by the us government 

  

that we failed to receive required approvals or licenses could eliminate or restrict our ability to sell our products outside the united states and the penalties that could be imposed by the us government for failure to comply with these laws could be significant 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and could harm our ability to react to changes to our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of september 30 2014 our total indebtedness was approximately 74731 million which was approximately 1263 of our total capitalization because of our recent dividends funded with indebtedness 

in addition we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future for example as of september 30 2014 we had approximately 4132 million of unused commitments under our revolving loan facility and 250 million of unused capacity under our trade receivable securitization facility the “securitization facility” with the availability of such capacity being dependent on the amount of our outstanding trade receivables although our senior secured credit facility and the indentures the “indentures” governing the 5 1  2  senior subordinated notes issued in october 2012 the “2020 notes” the 7 1  2  senior subordinated notes issued in july 2013 the “2021 notes” the 6 senior subordinated notes issued in june 2014 the “2022 notes and the 6 1  2  senior subordinated notes issued june 2014 the “2024 notes” and together with the 2020 notes the 2021 notes the 2022 notes the “notes” contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these qualifications and exceptions could be substantial if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage would increase 

our substantial debt could also have other important consequences to investors for example it could 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition all of our debt under the senior secured credit facility which includes a 39 billion term loan facility and a revolving loan facility of 4200 million bears interest at floating rates accordingly in the event that interest rates increase our debt service expense will also increase in order to reduce the floating interest rate risk as of september 30 2014 three forward starting interest rate swap agreements were in place fixing the rate of interest through june 30 2015 on an aggregate notional amount of 353 million of debt under the senior secured credit facility an additional three forward starting interest rate swap agreements were in place that fix the interest beginning september 30 2014 on an aggregate notional amount of 10 billion of debt under the senior secured credit facility in addition in july 2014 we entered into five forward starting interest rate swap agreements that fix the interest beginning march 31 2016 on an aggregate notional amount of 750 million of debt under the senior secured credit facility 

  

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness including the notes we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital 

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness including the notes amounts borrowed under the credit facilities amounts due under our securitization facility and to fund our operations will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future which to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness including the amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility amounts borrowed under our securitization facility and the notes or to fund our other liquidity needs if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital we cannot assure you that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations the terms of existing or future debt instruments the indentures and the senior secured credit facility may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives in addition any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms and would otherwise adversely affect the notes 

the terms of the senior secured credit facility and indentures may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

our senior secured credit facility and the indentures contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indentures and may limit their ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests the senior secured credit facility and indentures include covenants restricting among other things the ability of td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indentures to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the indentures if any such default occurs the lenders under the senior secured credit facility and the holders of the notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder to be immediately due and payable the lenders under the senior secured credit facility also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings in addition following an event of default under the senior secured credit facility the lenders under that facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which includes our available cash and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the notes if the debt under the senior secured credit facility or the notes were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations 

our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things discharges of pollutants into the air and water the generation handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees environmental laws and regulations may require that the company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations certain facilities and thirdparty sites utilized by subsidiaries of the company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws the company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws 

estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are based on current facts laws regulations and technology these estimates take into consideration the company’s prior experience and professional judgment of the company’s environmental advisors estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination the range of remediation alternatives available evolving remediation standards imprecise engineering evaluations and cost estimates the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 

accordingly as investigation and remediation proceed it is likely that adjustments in the company’s accruals will be necessary to reflect new information the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in a given period based on currently available information however the company does not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition 

environmental liabilities are recorded when the liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable which generally is not later than at completion of a feasibility study or when the company has recommended a remedy or has committed to an appropriate plan of action the liabilities are reviewed periodically and as investigation and remediation proceed adjustments are made as necessary liabilities for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not consider the effects of inflation and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value the liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties but do reflect anticipated allocations among potentially responsible parties at federal superfund sites or similar statemanaged sites third party indemnity obligations and an assessment of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their obligations at such sites 

  

we are dependent on our highly trained employees and any work stoppage or difficulty hiring similar employees could adversely affect our business 

because our products are complicated and highly engineered we depend on an educated and trained workforce there is substantial competition for skilled personnel in the aircraft component industry and we could be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled employees we may not be able to fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover or attract and retain qualified personnel 

as of september 30 2014 we had approximately 7300 full time part time and temporary employees approximately 11 of our full time and part time employees were represented by labor unions collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire at various dates ranging from february 2015 to may 2018 we consider our relationship with our employees generally to be satisfactory although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory we cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory renewal of these collective bargaining agreements or that our employee relations will remain stable because we maintain a relatively small inventory of finished goods any work stoppage could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide products to our customers 

our business is dependent on the availability of certain components and raw materials from suppliers 

our business is affected by the price and availability of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our components our business therefore could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our suppliers such as the destruction of our suppliers’ facilities or their distribution infrastructure a work stoppage or strike by our suppliers’ employees or the failure of our suppliers to provide materials of the requisite quality or by increased costs of such raw materials or components if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers because we maintain a relatively small inventory of raw materials and component parts our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers or alternative raw materials or component parts the lengthy and expensive faa and oem certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier raw material or component part 

our facilities are located near known earthquake fault zones and hurricane paths and the occurrence of a natural disaster could cause damage to our facilities and equipment which could require us to curtail or cease operations 

a number of our manufacturing facilities are located in the greater los angeles area an area known for earthquakes and are thus vulnerable to damage in addition a number of our manufacturing facilities are located along the eastern seaboard area susceptible to hurricanes we are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters including power loss fire explosions floods communications failures terrorist attacks and similar events if any disaster were to occur our ability to operate our business at our facilities could be impaired 

the company’s subsidiaries which operate outside of the continental united states may be subject to additional risks 

a number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including currency fluctuations difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies restrictions on the repatriation of funds change in trade policies tariff regulation difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition furthermore the company is subject to laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act or similar local antibribery laws which generally prohibit companies and their employees agents and contractors from making improper payments to governmental officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business failure to comply with these laws could subject the company to civil and criminal penalties that could materially adversely affect the company’s results of operations 

  

we face significant competition 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry and compete against a number of companies competitors in our product lines are both us and foreign companies and range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privately held entities we believe that our ability to compete depends on high product performance consistent high quality short leadtime and timely delivery competitive pricing superior customer service and support and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs we may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive 

we could be adversely affected if one of our components causes an aircraft to crash 

our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we have designed manufactured or serviced while we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future products liability claims in the event of product liability claims our insurers may attempt to deny coverage or any coverage we have may not be adequate we also may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost any liability not covered by insurance or for which third party indemnification is not available could result in significant liability to us 

in addition a crash caused by one of our components could damage our reputation for quality products we believe our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting a provider of aircraft components if a crash were to be caused by one of our components or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected 

we have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets which may never generate the returns we expect 

mergers and acquisitions have resulted in significant increases in identifiable intangible assets and goodwill identifiable intangible assets which primarily include trademarks trade names trade secrets and technology were approximately 12172 million at september 30 2014 representing approximately 18 of our total assets goodwill recognized in accounting for the mergers and acquisitions was approximately 35251 million at september 30 2014 representing approximately 52 of our total assets we may never realize the full value of our identifiable intangible assets and goodwill and to the extent we were to determine that our identifiable intangible assets or our goodwill were impaired within the meaning of applicable accounting standards we would be required to writeoff the amount of any impairment 

our stock price may be volatile and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 

there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities which is unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities these broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the purchase price due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects including possible changes due to the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry and other factors such as fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering which could cause shortterm swings in profit margins or unrelated to our operating performance including market conditions affecting the stock market generally or the stocks of aerospace companies more specifically 

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our share price 

we may sell additional shares of common stock into the public markets or issue convertible debt securities to raise capital in the future the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public markets or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities to raise capital at a time and price that we deem appropriate 

  

our corporate documents and delaware law contain certain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable for example our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 149600000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock without stockholder approval the board of directors has the authority to attach special rights including voting and dividend rights to this preferred stock with these rights holders of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75 of the voting power of our issued and outstanding capital stock voting together as a single class is required for the alteration amendment or repeal of certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and certain provisions of our amended and restated bylaws including the provisions relating to our stockholders’ ability to call special meetings notice provisions for stockholder business to be conducted at an annual meeting requests for stockholder lists and corporate records nomination and removal of directors and filling of vacancies on our board of directors 

we are also subject to the antitakeover provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law under these provisions if anyone becomes an “interested stockholder” we may not enter into a “business combination” with that person for three years without special approval which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change of control for purposes of section 203 “interested stockholder” means generally someone owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years subject to certain exceptions as described in section 203 

we do not pay regular quarterly or annual cash dividends on our stock 

on october 15 2012 july 3 2013 and june 4 2014 the company’s board of directors authorized and declared special cash dividends of 1285 2200 and 2500 respectively on each outstanding share of common stock and cash dividend equivalent payments to holders of options under its stock option plans 

notwithstanding the special cash dividends paid in october 2012 july 2013 and june 2014 we do not anticipate declaring or paying regular quarterly or annual cash dividends on our common stock or any other equity security in the foreseeable future the amounts that may be available to us to pay future special cash dividends are restricted under our debt and other agreements any payment of special cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations earnings capital requirements financial condition future prospects contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors therefore you should not rely on regular quarterly or annual dividend income from shares of our common stock and you should not rely on special dividends with any regularity or at all

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected financial data” and td group’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report the following discussion may contain predictions estimates and other forwardlooking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties including those discussed under the heading entitled “risk factors” included elsewhere in this report these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 

overview 

we believe we are a leading global designer producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers some of our more significant product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and engine technology specialized pumps and valves power conditioning devices specialized acdc electric motors and generators nicad batteries and chargers engineered latching and locking devices rods and locking devices engineered connectors and elastomers cockpit security components and systems specialized cockpit displays aircraft audio systems specialized lavatory components seatbelts and safety restraints engineered interior surfaces lighting and control technology and military personnel parachutes and cargo delivery systems each of these product offerings is composed of many individual products that are typically customized to meet the needs of a particular aircraft platform or customer 

longterm sustainable growth 

for fiscal year 2014 we generated net sales of 23729 million gross profit of 12679 million or 534 of sales and net income of 3069 million we believe we have achieved steady longterm growth in sales and improvements in operating performance since our formation in 1993 due to our competitive strengths and through execution of our valuedriven operating strategy more specifically focusing our businesses on our valuedriven operating strategy of obtaining profitable new business carefully controlling the cost structure and pricing our highly engineered valueadded products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so has historically resulted in improvements in gross profit and income from operations over the long term 

our selective acquisition strategy has also contributed to the growth of our business the integration of certain acquisitions into our existing businesses combined with implementing our proven operating strategy has historically resulted in improvements of the financial performance of the acquired business 

our key competitive strengths and the elements of our business strategy are set forth in more detail below 

we believe our key competitive strengths include 

large and growing installed product base with aftermarket revenue stream we provide components to a large and growing installed base of aircraft to which we supply aftermarket products we estimate that our products are installed on approximately 93000 commercial transport regional transport military and general aviation fixed wing turbine aircraft and rotary wing aircraft 

diversified revenue base we believe that our diversified revenue base reduces our dependence on any particular product platform or market channel and has been a significant factor in maintaining our financial performance our products are installed on almost all of the major commercial aircraft platforms now in production we expect to continue to develop new products for military and commercial applications 

  

significant barriers to entry  we believe that the niche nature of our markets the industry’s stringent regulatory and certification requirements the large number of products that we sell and the investments necessary to develop and certify products create barriers to entry for potential competitors 

our business strategy is made up of two key elements 1 a valuedriven operating strategy focused around our three core value drivers and 2 a selective acquisition strategy 

valuedriven operating strategy our three core value drivers are 

 

  

  

 selective acquisition strategy we selectively pursue the acquisition of proprietary aerospace component businesses when we see an opportunity to create value through the application of our three core valuedriven operating strategies the aerospace industry in particular remains highly fragmented with many of the companies in the industry being small private businesses or small noncore operations of larger businesses we have significant experience among our management team in executing acquisitions and integrating acquired businesses into our company and culture as of the date of this report we have successfully acquired 49 businesses andor product lines since our formation in 1993 many of these acquisitions have been integrated into an existing transdigm production facility which enables a higher production capacity utilization which in turn improves gross profit levels due to the ability to spread the fixed manufacturing overhead costs over higher production volume 

acquisitions and divestitures during the previous three fiscal years are more fully described in note 2 “acquisitions” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

  

ebitda and ebitda as defined 

the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income to ebitda and ebitda as defined 

 

  

         

the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to ebitda and ebitda as defined 

 

  

        trend information 

we predominantly serve customers in the commercial regional business jet and general aviation aftermarket which accounts for approximately 37 of total sales the commercial aerospace oem market comprising large commercial transport manufacturers and regional and business jet manufacturers which accounts for approximately 28 of total sales and the defense market which accounts for approximately 30 of total sales nonaerospace sales comprise approximately 5 of our total sales 

  

the commercial aerospace industry including the aftermarket and oem market is impacted by the health of the global economy and geopolitical events around the world the commercial aerospace industry had shown strength with increases in revenue passenger miles or rpms between 2003 and 2008 as well as increases in oem production and backlog however in 2009 the global economic downturn negatively impacted the commercial aerospace industry causing rpms to decline slightly this market sector began to rebound in 2010 and positive growth has continued thru 2014 with increases in rpms as well as the growth in the large commercial oem sector aircraft with 100 or more seats with order announcements by the boeing company and airbus sas leading to planned increases in production the 2015 leading indicators and industry consensus suggest a continuation of current trends in the commercial transport market sector supported by continued rpm growth and increases in production at the oem level 

the defense aerospace market is dependent on government budget constraints the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts it is not necessarily affected by general economic conditions that affect the commercial aerospace industry 

our presence in both the commercial aerospace and military sectors of the aerospace industry may mitigate the impact on our business of any specific industry risk we service a diversified customer base in the commercial and military aerospace industry and we provide components to a diverse installed base of aircraft which mitigates our exposure to any individual airframe platform at times declines in sales in one channel have been offset by increased sales in another however due to differences between the profitability of our products sold to oem and aftermarket customers variation in product mix can cause variation in gross margin 

there are many shortterm factors including inventory corrections unannounced changes in order patterns strikes and mergers and acquisitions that can cause shortterm disruptions in our quarterly shipment patterns as compared to previous quarters and the same periods in prior years as such it can be difficult to determine longerterm trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons to normalize for shortterm fluctuations we tend to look at our performance over several quarters or years of activity rather than discrete shortterm periods 

there are also fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering and delivery requests from quartertoquarter as well as variations in product mix from quartertoquarter that may cause positive or negative variations in gross profit margins since commercial aftermarket sales have historically produced a higher gross margin than sales to commercial oems again in many instances these are timing events between quarters and must be balanced with macro aerospace industry indicators 

commercial aftermarket 

the key growth factors in the commercial aftermarket include worldwide rpms and the size and activity level of the worldwide fleet of aircraft after a decline in rpms in 2009 worldwide rpms returned to growth between 2010 and 2014 and current industry consensus indicates that positive rpm growth will continue in 2015 

commercial oem market 

the commercial transport market sector continued to grow during 2014 our commercial transport oem shipments and revenues generally run ahead of the boeing and airbus airframe delivery schedules as a result and consistent with prior years our fiscal 2015 shipments will be a function of among other things the estimated 2015 and 2016 commercial airframe production rates we have been experiencing increased sales in the large commercial oem sector aircraft with 100 or more seats driven by an increase in production by the boeing company and airbus sas tied to previous order announcements industry consensus indicates this production increase will continue in 2015 and 2016 though the growth may moderate and begin to flatten 

  

the business jet oem market significantly declined between 2008 and 2010 impacted by the slowdown in economic growth corporate profits commodity prices and stock market returns across the world however the business jet oem market started to modestly recover in 2012 but has remained sluggish through 2014 and could show modest growth in 2015 

defense 

our military business fluctuates from year to year and is dependent to a degree on government budget constraints the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts in recent years defense spending has reached historic highs due in part to the military engagements in afghanistan and iraq and the war on terrorism for a variety of reasons the military spending outlook is very uncertain for planning purposes we assume that military related sales of our types of products to be flat to modestly down in future years over the recent high levels 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations however investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 

below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions for additional accounting policies see note 3 “summary of significant accounting policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 

revenue recognition and related allowances  revenue is recognized from the sale of products when title and risk of loss passes to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment substantially all product sales are made pursuant to firm fixedprice purchase orders received from customers collectability of amounts recorded as revenue is reasonably assured at the time of sale provisions for returns uncollectible accounts and the cost of repairs under contract warranty provisions are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are principally based on historical results modified as appropriate by the most current information available we have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of such allowances however due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process it is possible that actual results may vary from the estimates and the differences could be material 

management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable and customer creditworthiness the allowance also incorporates a provision for the estimated impact of disputes with customers management’s estimate of the allowance amounts that are necessary includes amounts for specifically identified credit losses and estimated credit losses based on historical information the determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to significant levels of judgment and estimation by management depending on the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues or if the financial condition of any of the company’s customers were to deteriorate and their ability to make required payments were to become impaired increases in these allowances may be required historically changes in estimates in the allowance for doubtful accounts have not been significant 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost of inventories is determined by the average cost and the firstin firstout fifo methods for all locations except cef industries llc which determines the cost of inventories using the lastin firstout lifo method because the company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be inservice for 25 or more years it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use where management estimated that the current market value was below cost or determined that future demand was lower than current inventory levels based on historical experience 

  

current and projected market demand current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value was made by recording a provision included in cost of sales although management believes that the company’s estimates of excess and obsolete inventory are reasonable actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future in addition in accordance with industry practice all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year historically changes in estimates in the net realizable value of inventories have not been significant 

intangible assets  mergers and acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method and have resulted in significant amounts of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill fair value adjustments to the company’s assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition we generally use thirdparty appraisals to assist us in determining the estimated fair value of the intangible assets 

intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights or if the intangible asset can be sold transferred licensed or exchanged regardless of the company’s intent to do so goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition and are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates 

gaap requires that the annual and any interim impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level the reporting unit level is one level below an operating segment substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each reporting unit pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction with respect to acquisitions integrated into an existing reporting unit any acquired goodwill is combined with the goodwill of the reporting unit 

at the time of goodwill impairment testing management determines the estimated fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit if the calculated estimated fair value is less than the current carrying value impairment of goodwill of the reporting unit may exist the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing includes discount rates growth rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates are set by using the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” methodology the wacc methodology considers market and industry data as well as company specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business 

management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates as an indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately through the use of the discounted cash flow valuation model the aggregate of all reporting unit’s estimated fair value is reconciled to the total market capitalization of the company 

the company had 27 reporting units with goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 the date of the last annual impairment test the estimated fair values of each of the reporting units was substantially in excess of their respective carrying values by 19 percent or more and therefore no goodwill impairment was recorded the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate which is a significant assumption in the calculation of fair values with a one percentage point increase in the discount rate the reporting units would continue to have fair values in excess of their respective carrying values 

  

management tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at the asset level as determined by appropriate asset valuation at the time of acquisition the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets consists of a comparison between the estimated fair values and carrying values if the carrying amounts of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives exceed their estimated fair values an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference management utilizes the royalty savings valuation method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset in this method management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset the key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates royalty rates growth rates sales projections and terminal value rates discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the wacc methodology considering any differences in companyspecific risk factors between reporting units and the indefinitelived intangible assets royalty rates are established by management with the advice of valuation experts and periodically substantiated by valuation experts management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant intangible asset terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates 

the discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed actual results could differ from these assumptions management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering the current economic conditions 

income taxes  the company estimates income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates this involves estimating taxable earnings specific taxable and deductible items the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits to the extent these estimates change adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes are made in the period in which the changes occur historically such adjustments have not been significant 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain operating data of the company including presentation of the amounts as a percentage of net sales amounts in thousands 

 

   

fiscal year ended september 30 2014 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2013 

total company 

net sales  net organic sales and acquisition sales and the related dollar and percentage changes for the fiscal years ended september 30 2014 and 2013 were as follows amounts in millions 

 

 acquisition sales represent sales of acquired businesses for the period up to one year subsequent to their acquisition dates the amount of acquisition sales shown in the table above was mainly attributable to the acquisition of airborne and eme in fiscal 2014 and whippany actuation arkwin and aerosonic in fiscal 2013 

organic sales for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 include a favorable commercial oem retroactive contract pricing adjustment of approximately 2 million excluding the impact of the retroactive contract pricing adjustment commercial oem sales increased 493 million or an increase of 86 commercial aftermarket sales increased 901 million or an increase of 120 and defense sales increased 265 million or an increase of 55 for the fiscal year ended september 30 2014 compared to the fiscal year ended september 30 2013

foreign operations 

although we manufacture a significant portion of our products in the united states we manufacture some products in belgium china malaysia mexico sri lanka and the united kingdom we sell our products in the united states as well as in foreign countries although the majority of sales of our products are made to customers including distributors located in the united states our products are ultimately sold to and used by customers including airlines and other end users of aircraft throughout the world a number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including currency fluctuations difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies restrictions on the repatriation of funds change in trade policies tariff regulation difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition 

our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately 7359 million 5720 million and 5088 million for fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks including the impact of foreign government regulations political uncertainties and differences in business practices there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments’ countries furthermore there can be no assurance that the political cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically maintained a capital structure comprising a mix of equity and debt financing we vary our leverage both to optimize our equity return and to pursue acquisitions we expect to meet our current debt obligations as they come due through internally generated funds from current levels of operations andor through refinancing in the debt or equity markets prior to the maturity dates of our debt 

we continually evaluate our debt facilities to assess whether they most efficiently and effectively meet the current and future needs of our business the company evaluates from time to time the appropriateness of its current leverage taking into consideration the company’s debt holders equity holders credit ratings acquisition opportunities and other factors the company’s debt leverage ratio which is computed as total debt divided by ebitda as defined for the applicable twelvemonth period has varied widely during the company’s history ranging from approximately 35 to 70 our debt leverage ratio at september 30 2014 was approximately 70 

the company regularly engages in discussions with respect to potential acquisitions and investments however there can be no assurance that the company will be able to consummate an agreement with respect to any future acquisition the company’s acquisition strategy may require substantial capital and no assurance can be given that the company will be able to raise any necessary funds on acceptable terms or at all if the company incurs additional debt to finance acquisitions total interest expense will increase 

  

if the company has excess cash it may consider methods by which it can provide cash to its debt or equity holders through a dividend prepayment of indebtedness repurchase of stock repurchase of debt or other means whether the company undertakes additional stock repurchases or other aforementioned activities will depend on prevailing market conditions the company’s liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material in addition the company may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so 

the company’s ability to make scheduled interest payments on or to refinance the company’s indebtedness or to fund nonacquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on the company’s ability to generate cash in the future this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control based on its current levels of operations and absent any disruptive events management believes that internally generated funds and borrowings available under our revolving loan facility should provide sufficient resources to finance its operations nonacquisition related capital expenditures research and development efforts and longterm indebtedness obligations through at least fiscal 2015 there can be no assurance however that the company’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to the company under the senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its indebtedness or to fund its other liquidity needs the company may need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness on or before maturity also to the extent the company accelerates its growth plans consummates acquisitions or has lower than anticipated sales or increases in expenses the company may also need to raise additional capital in particular increased working capital needs occur whenever the company consummates acquisitions or experiences strong incremental demand there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the company has not at this time determined to change the nature of its debt facilities however in the future the company may increase its borrowings in connection with acquisitions if cash flow from operations becomes insufficient to fund current operations or for other shortterm cash needs or for stock repurchases or dividends our future leverage will also be impacted by the then current conditions of the credit markets

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

 item 1 business tableend the company 

transdigm inc was formed in 1993 in connection with a leveraged buyout transaction td group was formed in 2003 to facilitate a leveraged buyout of transdigm inc the company was owned by private equity funds until its initial public offering in 2006 td group’s common stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “tdg” 

we believe we are a leading global designer producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers we estimate that about 90 of our net sales for fiscal year 2013 were generated by proprietary products in addition for fiscal year 2013 we estimate that we generated about 3  4 of our net sales from products for which we are the sole source provider 

most of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue once our parts are designed into and sold on a new aircraft we generate net sales from aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft which is generally estimated to be approximately 30 years a typical platform can be produced for 20 to 30 years giving us an estimated product life cycle of 5060 years we estimate that approximately 53 of our net sales in fiscal year 2013 were generated from aftermarket sales the vast majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets these aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and been more stable than sales to original equipment manufacturers or oems 

products 

we primarily design produce and supply highlyengineered proprietary aerospace components and certain systemssubsystems with significant aftermarket content we seek to develop highly customized products to solve specific needs for aircraft operators and manufacturers we attempt to differentiate ourselves based on 

  

engineering service and manufacturing capabilities we typically choose not to compete for nonproprietary “build to print” business because it frequently offers lower margins than proprietary products we believe that our products have strong brand names within the industry and that we have a reputation for high quality reliability and customer support 

our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products that we offer to our customers some of our more significant product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and engine technology specialized pumps and valves power conditioning devices specialized acdc electric motors and generators nicad batteries and chargers engineered latching and locking devices rods and locking devices engineered connectors and elastomers cockpit security components and systems specialized cockpit displays aircraft audio systems specialized lavatory components seatbelts and safety restraints engineered interior surfaces and lighting and control technology 

segments 

during transdigm’s third quarter ended june 29 2013 the company changed its internal management structure and its reporting structure of financial information used to assess performance and allocate resources the company’s businesses are organized and managed in three reporting segments power  control airframe and nonaviation

sales and marketing 

consistent with our overall strategy our sales and marketing organization is structured to continually develop technical solutions that meet customer needs in particular we attempt to focus on products and programs that will lead to highmargin repeatable sales in the aftermarket 

  

we have structured our sales efforts along our major product offerings assigning a product manager to certain products each product manager is expected to grow the sales and profitability of the products for which he or she is responsible and to achieve the targeted annual level of bookings sales new business and profitability for such products the product managers are assisted by account managers and sales engineers who are responsible for covering major oem and aftermarket accounts account managers and sales engineers are expected to be familiar with the personnel organization and needs of specific customers to achieve total bookings and new business goals at each account and together with the product managers to determine when additional resources are required at customer locations most of our sales personnel are evaluated in part on their bookings and their ability to identify and obtain new business opportunities 

though typically performed by employees the account manager function may be performed by independent representatives depending on the specific customer product and geographic location we also use a number of distributors to provide logistical support as well as primary customer contact with certain smaller accounts our major distributors are aviall inc a subsidiary of the boeing company and satair as a subsidiary of airbus 

manufacturing and engineering 

we maintain 38 principal manufacturing facilities most of our manufacturing facilities are comprised of manufacturing distribution and engineering functions and most facilities have certain administrative functions including management sales and finance we continually strive to improve productivity and reduce costs including rationalization of operations developing improved control systems that allow for accurate product profit and loss accounting investing in equipment tooling information systems and implementing broadbased employee training programs management believes that our manufacturing systems and equipment contribute to our ability to compete by permitting us to meet the rigorous tolerances and cost sensitive price structure of aircraft component customers 

we attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by producing uniquely engineered products with high quality and timely delivery our engineering costs are recorded in cost of sales and in selling and administrative expenses captions in our consolidated statements of income total engineering expense represents approximately 6 of our operating units’ aggregate costs or approximately 3 of our consolidated net sales our proprietary products and particularly our new product initiatives are designed by our engineers and are intended to serve the needs of the aircraft component industry these proprietary designs must withstand the extraordinary conditions and stresses that will be endured by products during use and meet the rigorous demands of our customers’ tolerance and quality requirements 

we use sophisticated equipment and procedures to comply with quality requirements specifications and federal aviation administration the “faa” and oem requirements we perform a variety of testing procedures including testing under different temperature humidity and altitude levels shock and vibration testing and xray fluorescent measurement these procedures together with other customer approved techniques for document process and quality control are used throughout our manufacturing facilities 

customers 

our customers include 1 distributors of aerospace components 2 worldwide commercial airlines including national and regional airlines 3 large commercial transport and regional and business aircraft oems 4 various armed forces of the united states and friendly foreign governments 5 defense oems 6 system suppliers and 7 various other industrial customers for the year ended september 30 2013 boeing which includes aviall inc a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world accounted for approximately 12 of our net sales our top ten customers for fiscal year 2013 accounted for approximately 41 of our net sales products supplied to many of our customers are used on multiple platforms 

active commercial production programs include the boeing 737 747 767 777 and 787 the airbus a3192021 a330a340 and a380 the bombardier crj’s challenger and learjets the embraer rj’s the cessna citation family the raytheon premier and hawker and most gulfstream airframes military platforms 

  

include aircraft such as the boeing c17 f15 f18 and v22 the airbus a400m the lockheed martin c130j f16 and f35 joint strikefighter the northrop grumman e2c hawkeye the sikorsky uh60 helicopter ch47 chinook and ah64 apache helicopters the general atomics predator drone and the raytheon patriot missile transdigm has been awarded numerous contracts for the development of engineered products for production on the airbus a350xwb and a320 neo the bombardier learjet 85 the sikorsky s97 and boeing p8 poseidon 

the demand for our aftermarket parts and services depends on among other things the breadth of our installed oem base revenue passenger miles “rpms” the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and to a lesser extent airline profitability we believe that we are also a leading supplier of components used on us designed military aircraft including components that are used on a variety of fighter aircraft military freighters and military helicopters 

competition 

the niche markets within the aerospace industry that we serve are relatively fragmented and we face several competitors for many of the products and services we provide due to the global nature of the commercial aircraft industry competition in these categories comes from both us and foreign companies competitors in our product offerings range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privatelyheld entities with only one or two components in their entire product portfolios 

we compete on the basis of engineering manufacturing and marketing high quality products which we believe meet or exceed the performance and maintenance requirements of our customers consistent and timely delivery and superior customer service and support the industry’s stringent regulatory certification and technical requirements and the investments necessary in the development and certification of products create barriers to entry for potential new competitors as long as customers receive products that meet or exceed expectations and performance standards we believe that they will have a reduced incentive to certify another supplier because of the cost and time of the technical design and testing certification process in addition we believe that the availability dependability and safety of our products are reasons for our customers to continue longterm supplier relationships 

government contracts 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 1 suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations 2 terminate existing contracts 3 reduce the value of existing contracts 4 audit our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs and 5 control and potentially prohibit the export of our products 

governmental regulation 

the commercial aircraft component industry is highly regulated by both the faa in the united states and by the joint aviation authorities in europe and other agencies throughout the world while the military aircraft component industry is governed by military quality specifications we and the components we manufacture are required to be certified by one or more of these entities or agencies and in many cases by individual oems in order to engineer and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models 

we must also satisfy the requirements of our customers including oems and airlines that are subject to faa regulations and provide these customers with products and services that comply with the government regulations applicable to commercial flight operations in addition the faa requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components we believe that we currently satisfy or exceed these maintenance standards in our repair and overhaul services we also maintain several faa approved repair stations 

  

in addition sales of many of our products that will be used on aircraft owned by nonus entities are subject to compliance with us export control laws 

our operations are also subject to a variety of worker and community safety laws the occupational safety and health act “osha” mandates general requirements for safe workplaces for all employees in addition osha provides special procedures and measures for the handling of certain hazardous and toxic substances 

raw materials 

we require the use of various raw materials in our manufacturing processes we also purchase a variety of manufactured component parts from various suppliers at times we concentrate our orders among a few suppliers in order to strengthen our supplier relationships raw materials and component parts are generally available from multiple suppliers at competitive prices 

intellectual property 

we have various trade secrets proprietary information trademarks trade names patents copyrights and other intellectual property rights which we believe in the aggregate but not individually are important to our business 

backlog 

as of september 30 2013 the company estimated its sales order backlog at 1081 million compared to an estimated sales order backlog of 833 million as of september 30 2012 the increase in backlog is primarily due to acquisitions discussed below totaling approximately 202 million and an increase in orders across existing oem product lines and to a lesser extent the aftermarket the majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of september 30 2013 are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months purchase orders may be subject to cancellation or deferral by the customer prior to shipment the level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of the company’s receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled accordingly the company’s backlog as of september 30 2013 may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period 

foreign operations 

although we manufacture a significant portion of our products in the united states we manufacture some products in belgium china malaysia mexico sri lanka and the united kingdom we sell our products in the united states as well as in foreign countries although the majority of sales of our products are made to customers including distributors located in the united states our products are ultimately sold to and used by customers including airlines and other end users of aircraft throughout the world a number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including currency fluctuations difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies restrictions on the repatriation of funds change in trade policies tariff regulation difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition 

our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately 5720 million 5088 million and 3055 million for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks including the impact of foreign government regulations political uncertainties and differences in business practices there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments’ countries furthermore there can be no assurance that the political cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 

  

environmental matters 

our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things discharges of pollutants into the air and water the generation handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees environmental laws and regulations may require that the company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations certain facilities and thirdparty sites utilized by subsidiaries of the company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws the company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws 

estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are based on current facts laws regulations and technology these estimates take into consideration the company’s prior experience and professional judgment of the company’s environmental advisors estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination the range of remediation alternatives available evolving remediation standards imprecise engineering evaluations and cost estimates the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 

accordingly as investigation and remediation proceed it is likely that adjustments in the company’s accruals will be necessary to reflect new information the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in a given period based on currently available information however the company does not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition 

environmental liabilities are recorded when the liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable which generally is not later than at completion of a feasibility study or when the company has recommended a remedy or has committed to an appropriate plan of action the liabilities are reviewed periodically and as investigation and remediation proceed adjustments are made as necessary liabilities for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not consider the effects of inflation and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value the liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties but do reflect anticipated allocations among potentially responsible parties at federal superfund sites or similar statemanaged sites third party indemnity obligations and an assessment of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their obligations at such sites 

employees 

as of september 30 2013 we had approximately 6100 full time part time and temporary employees approximately 13 of our full time and part time employees were represented by labor unions collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire at various dates ranging from february 2014 to may 2018 we consider our relationship with our employees generally to be satisfactory 

legal proceedings 

we are from time to time subject to and are presently involved in litigation or other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business based upon information currently known to us we believe the outcome of such proceedings will not have individually or in the aggregate a material adverse effect on our business our financial condition or results of operations

td group’s annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k including any amendments will be made available free of charge on the company’s website wwwtransdigmcom  as soon as reasonably practicable following the filing of the reports with the securities and exchange commission 

  

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend set forth below are important risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business and financial condition and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

our business is sensitive to the number of flight hours that our customers’ planes spend aloft the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and our customers’ profitability these items are in turn affected by general economic conditions 

our business is directly affected by among other factors changes in revenue passenger miles rpms the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and to a lesser extent changes in the profitability of the commercial airline industry rpms and airline profitability have historically been correlated with the general economic environment although national and international events also play a key role for example in the recent past the airline industry has been severely affected by the downturn in the global economy higher fuel prices the increased security concerns among airline customers following the events of september 11 2001 the severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars epidemic and the conflicts in afghanistan and iraq in addition global market and economic conditions have been challenging with continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies and have prolonged declines in business and consumer spending as a result of the substantial reduction in airline traffic resulting from these events the airline industry incurred large losses and financial difficulties some carriers have also parked or retired a portion of their fleets and have reduced workforces and flights during periods of reduced airline profitability some airlines may delay purchases of spare parts preferring instead to deplete existing inventories if demand for new aircraft and spare parts decreases there would be a decrease in demand for certain of our products 

our sales to manufacturers of aircraft are cyclical and a downturn in sales to these manufacturers may adversely affect us 

our sales to manufacturers of large commercial aircraft such as the boeing company airbus sas and related oem suppliers as well as manufacturers of business jets which accounted for approximately 27 of our net sales in fiscal year 2013 have historically experienced periodic downturns in the past these sales have been affected by airline profitability which is impacted by among other things fuel and labor costs price competition downturns in the global economy and national and international events such as the events of september 11 2001 in addition sales of our products to manufacturers of business jets are impacted by among other things downturns in the global economy downturns adversely affect our net sales gross margin and net income 

we rely heavily on certain customers for much of our sales 

our largest customer for fiscal year 2013 was the boeing company which includes aviall inc a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world boeing accounted for approximately 12 of our net sales in fiscal year 2013 our top ten customers for fiscal year 2013 accounted for approximately 41 of our net sales a material reduction in purchasing by one of our larger customers for any reason including but not limited to economic downturn decreased production strike or resourcing could have a material adverse effect on our net sales gross margin and net income 

we generally do not have guaranteed future sales of our products further when we enter into fixed price contracts with some of our customers we take the risk for cost overruns 

as is customary in our business we do not generally have longterm contracts with most of our aftermarket customers and therefore do not have guaranteed future sales although we have longterm contracts with many of our oem customers many of those customers may terminate the contracts on short notice and in most cases 

  

our customers have not committed to buy any minimum quantity of our products in addition in certain cases we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon the historic purchasing patterns of customers and upon our discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements and this anticipated future volume of orders may not materialize 

we also have entered into multiyear fixedprice contracts with some of our customers pursuant to which we have agreed to perform the work for a fixed price and accordingly realize all the benefit or detriment resulting from any decreases or increases in the costs of making these products sometimes we accept a fixedprice contract for a product that we have not yet produced and this increases the risk of cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product most of our contracts do not permit us to recover increases in raw material prices taxes or labor costs 

us military spending is dependent upon the us defense budget 

the military and defense market is significantly dependent upon government budget trends particularly the us department of defense the “dod” budget in addition to normal business risks our supply of products to the united states government is subject to unique risks largely beyond our control dod budgets could be negatively impacted by several factors including but not limited to a change in defense spending policy by the current presidential administration the us government’s budget deficits spending priorities the cost of sustaining the us military presence in the middle east and possible political pressure to reduce us government military spending each of which could cause the dod budget to remain unchanged or to decline a significant decline in us military expenditures could result in a reduction in the amount of our products sold to the various agencies and buying organizations of the us government 

we intend to pursue acquisitions our business may be adversely affected if we cannot consummate acquisitions on satisfactory terms or if we cannot effectively integrate acquired operations 

a significant portion of our growth has occurred through acquisitions any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions we intend to pursue acquisitions that we believe will present opportunities consistent with our overall business strategy however we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates to purchase or may be unable to acquire desired businesses or assets on economically acceptable terms in addition we may not be able to raise the capital necessary to fund future acquisitions because we may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously we may encounter unforeseen expenses complications and delays including regulatory complications or difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight 

we regularly engage in discussions with respect to potential acquisition and investment opportunities if we consummate an acquisition our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly future acquisitions could likely result in the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest and amortization expenses or periodic impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets as well as significant charges relating to integration costs 

acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect in addition we may not be able to successfully integrate any business we acquire into our existing business the successful integration of new businesses depends on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs the successful integration of future acquisitions may also require substantial attention from our senior management and the management of the acquired business which could decrease the time that they have to service attract customers and develop new products and services or attend to other acquisition opportunities 

  

we are subject to certain unique business risks as a result of supplying equipment and services to the us government 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 

 

  

  

  

 most of our us government contracts can be terminated by the us government for its convenience without significant notice termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination 

on contracts for which the price is based on cost the us government may review our costs and performance as well as our accounting and general business practices based on the results of such audits the us government may adjust our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs in addition under us government purchasing regulations some of our costs including most financing costs amortization of intangible assets portions of research and development costs and certain marketing expenses may not be subject to reimbursement 

in addition even where the price is not based on cost the us government may seek to review our costs to determine whether our pricing is “fair and reasonable” five of our subsidiaries and divisions were subject to such a pricing review for years 2002 through 2004 and it is possible that we will be subject to a similar pricing review in the future such a review could be costly and time consuming for our management and could distract from our ability to effectively manage the business as a result of such a review we could be subject to providing a refund to the us government or we could be asked to enter into an arrangement whereby our prices would be based on cost or the dod could seek to pursue alternative sources of supply for our parts any of those occurrences could lead to a reduction in our revenue from or the profitability of certain of our supply arrangements with certain agencies and buying organizations of the us government 

our business may be adversely affected if we would lose our government or industry approvals or if more stringent government regulations are enacted or if industry oversight is increased 

the aerospace industry is highly regulated in the united states and in other countries in order to sell our components we and the components we manufacture must be certified by the faa the dod and similar agencies in foreign countries and by individual manufacturers if new and more stringent government regulations are adopted or if industry oversight increases we might incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or heightened industry oversight in addition if material authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended our business would be adversely affected 

in addition to the aviation approvals we are at times required to obtain approval from us government agencies to export our products failure to obtain approval to export or determination by the us government that we failed to receive required approvals or licenses could eliminate or restrict our ability to sell our products outside the united states and the penalties that could be imposed by the us government for failure to comply with these laws could be significant 

  

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and could harm our ability to react to changes to our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of september 30 2013 our total indebtedness was approximately 57312 million which was approximately 1062 of our total capitalization because of our recent dividends funded with indebtedness 

in addition we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future for example as of september 30 2013 we had approximately 3032 million of unused commitments under our revolving loan facility although our senior secured credit facility and the indentures the “indentures” governing the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes issued in december 2010 the “2018 notes” the 5 1  2  senior subordinated notes issued in october 2012 the “2020 notes” and the 7 1  2  senior subordinated notes issued in july 2013 the “2021 notes” contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these qualifications and exceptions could be substantial if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage would increase 

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to investors for example it could 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition all of our debt under the senior secured credit facility which includes a 31 billion term loan facility and a revolving loan facility of 3100 million bears interest at floating rates accordingly in the event that interest rates increase our debt service expense will also increase in order to reduce the floating interest rate risk as of september 30 2013 three forward starting interest rate swap agreements were in place fixing the rate of interest through june 30 2015 on an aggregate notional amount of 353 million of debt under the senior secured credit facility in addition in fiscal 2013 the company entered into three forward starting interest rate swap agreements that fix the interest beginning september 30 2014 on an aggregate notional amount of 10 billion of debt under the senior secured credit facility 

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness including the 2018 notes 2020 notes and the 2021 notes we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital 

  

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make payments on our indebtedness including the 2018 notes 2020 notes 2021 notes and amounts borrowed under the credit facilities and to fund our operations will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future which to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness including the amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility and the 2018 notes 2020 notes and the 2021 notes or to fund our other liquidity needs if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital we cannot assure you that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations the terms of existing or future debt instruments the indentures and the senior secured credit facility may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives in addition any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms and would otherwise adversely affect the 2018 notes 2020 notes and the 2021 notes 

the terms of the senior secured credit facility and indentures may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

our senior secured credit facility and the indentures contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indentures and may limit their ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests the senior secured credit facility and indentures include covenants restricting among other things the ability of td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indentures to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the indentures if any such default occurs the lenders under the senior secured credit facility and the holders of the 2018 notes 2020 notes and the 2021 notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder to be immediately due and payable the lenders under the senior secured credit facility also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings in addition following an event of default under the senior secured credit facility the lenders under that facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which includes our available cash and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the 2018 notes 2020 notes and the 2021 notes if the debt under the senior secured credit facility or the 2018 notes 2020 notes and the 2021 notes were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations 

our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things discharges of pollutants into the air and water the generation handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees environmental laws and regulations may require that the company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations certain facilities and thirdparty sites utilized by subsidiaries of the company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws the company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws 

estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are based on current facts laws regulations and technology these estimates take into consideration the company’s prior experience and professional judgment of the company’s environmental advisors estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination the range of remediation alternatives available evolving remediation standards imprecise engineering evaluations and cost estimates the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 

accordingly as investigation and remediation proceed it is likely that adjustments in the company’s accruals will be necessary to reflect new information the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in a given period based on currently available information however the company does not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition 

environmental liabilities are recorded when the liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable which generally is not later than at completion of a feasibility study or when the company has recommended a remedy or has committed to an appropriate plan of action the liabilities are reviewed periodically and as investigation and remediation proceed adjustments are made as necessary liabilities for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not consider the effects of inflation and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value the liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties but do reflect anticipated allocations among potentially responsible parties at federal superfund sites or similar statemanaged sites third party indemnity obligations and an assessment of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their obligations at such sites 

  

we are dependent on our highly trained employees and any work stoppage or difficulty hiring similar employees could adversely affect our business 

because our products are complicated and highly engineered we depend on an educated and trained workforce there is substantial competition for skilled personnel in the aircraft component industry and we could be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled employees we may not be able to fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover or attract and retain qualified personnel 

as of september 30 2013 we had approximately 6100 full time part time and temporary employees approximately 13 of our full time and part time employees were represented by labor unions collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire at various dates ranging from february 2014 to may 2018 we consider our relationship with our employees generally to be satisfactory although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory we cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory renewal of these collective bargaining agreements or that our employee relations will remain stable because we maintain a relatively small inventory of finished goods any work stoppage could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide products to our customers 

our business is dependent on the availability of certain components and raw materials from suppliers 

our business is affected by the price and availability of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our components our business therefore could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our suppliers such as the destruction of our suppliers’ facilities or their distribution infrastructure a work stoppage or strike by our suppliers’ employees or the failure of our suppliers to provide materials of the requisite quality or by increased costs of such raw materials or components if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers because we maintain a relatively small inventory of raw materials and component parts our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers or alternative raw materials or component parts the lengthy and expensive faa and oem certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier raw material or component part 

our facilities are located near known earthquake fault zones and hurricane paths and the occurrence of a natural disaster could cause damage to our facilities and equipment which could require us to curtail or cease operations 

a number of our manufacturing facilities are located in the greater los angeles area an area known for earthquakes and are thus vulnerable to damage in addition a number of our manufacturing facilities are located along the eastern seaboard area susceptible to hurricanes we are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters including power loss fire explosions floods communications failures terrorist attacks and similar events if any disaster were to occur our ability to operate our business at our facilities could be impaired 

we have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets which may never generate the returns we expect 

mergers and acquisitions have resulted in significant increases in identifiable intangible assets and goodwill identifiable intangible assets which primarily include trademarks trade names trade secrets and technology were approximately 11895 million at september 30 2013 representing approximately 19 of our total assets goodwill recognized in accounting for the mergers and acquisitions was approximately 33439 million at september 30 2013 representing approximately 54 of our total assets we may never realize the full value of our identifiable intangible assets and goodwill and to the extent we were to determine that our identifiable intangible assets or our goodwill were impaired within the meaning of applicable accounting standards we would be required to writeoff the amount of any impairment 

  

we face significant competition 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry and compete against a number of companies competitors in our product lines are both us and foreign companies and range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privately held entities we believe that our ability to compete depends on high product performance consistent high quality short leadtime and timely delivery competitive pricing superior customer service and support and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs we may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive 

we could be adversely affected if one of our components causes an aircraft to crash 

our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we have designed manufactured or serviced while we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future products liability claims in the event of product liability claims our insurers may attempt to deny coverage or any coverage we have may not be adequate we also may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost any liability not covered by insurance or for which third party indemnification is not available could result in significant liability to us 

in addition a crash caused by one of our components could damage our reputation for quality products we believe our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting a provider of aircraft components if a crash were to be caused by one of our components or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected 

our stock price may be volatile and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 

there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities which is unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities these broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the purchase price due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects including possible changes due to the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry and other factors such as fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering which could cause shortterm swings in profit margins or unrelated to our operating performance including market conditions affecting the stock market generally or the stocks of aerospace companies more specifically 

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our share price 

we may sell additional shares of common stock into the public markets or issue convertible debt securities to raise capital in the future the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public markets or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities to raise capital at a time and price that we deem appropriate 

our corporate documents and delaware law contain certain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable for example our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 149600000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock without stockholder approval the board of directors has the authority to attach special rights including voting and dividend rights to this preferred stock with these rights holders of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us in addition our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered board of directors whereby directors serve for threeyear 

  

terms with approximately onethird of the directors coming up for reelection each year having a staggered board will make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of our board of directors through a proxy contest which may be a necessary step in an acquisition of us that is not favored by our board of directors our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75 of the voting power of our issued and outstanding capital stock voting together as a single class is required for the alteration amendment or repeal of certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation including the provisions authorizing a staggered board and certain provisions of our amended and restated bylaws including the provisions relating to our stockholders’ ability to call special meetings notice provisions for stockholder business to be conducted at an annual meeting requests for stockholder lists and corporate records nomination and removal of directors and filling of vacancies on our board of directors 

we are also subject to the antitakeover provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law under these provisions if anyone becomes an “interested stockholder” we may not enter into a “business combination” with that person for three years without special approval which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change of control for purposes of section 203 “interested stockholder” means generally someone owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years subject to certain exceptions as described in section 203 

we do not pay regular quarterly or annual cash dividends on our stock 

on october 15 2012 the company’s board of directors authorized and declared a special cash dividend of 1285 on each outstanding share of common stock and cash dividend equivalent payments to holders of options under its stock option plans the special cash dividend amounting to approximately 6643 million in the aggregate was paid in november 2012 

on july 3 2013 the company’s board of directors authorized and declared a special cash dividend of 2200 on each outstanding share of common stock and cash dividend equivalent payments to holders of options under certain of its stock option plans the special cash dividend amounting to approximately 11558 million in the aggregate was paid in july 2013 

notwithstanding the special cash dividends paid in october 2012 and july 2013 we do not anticipate declaring or paying regular quarterly or annual cash dividends on our common stock or any other equity security in the foreseeable future the amounts that may be available to us to pay future special cash dividends are restricted under our debt and other agreements any payment of special cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations earnings capital requirements financial condition future prospects contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors therefore you should not rely on regular quarterly or annual dividend income from shares of our common stock and you should not rely on special dividends with any regularity or at all

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected financial data” and td group’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report the following discussion may contain predictions estimates and other forwardlooking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties including those discussed under the heading entitled “risk factors” included elsewhere in this report these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 

overview 

we believe we are a leading global designer producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers some of our more significant product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and engine technology specialized pumps and valves power conditioning devices specialized acdc electric motors and generators nicad batteries and chargers engineered latching and locking devices rods and locking devices engineered connectors and elastomers cockpit security components and systems specialized cockpit displays aircraft audio systems specialized lavatory components seatbelts and safety restraints engineered interior surfaces and lighting and control technology each of these product offerings is composed of many individual products that are typically customized to meet the needs of a particular aircraft platform or customer 

longterm sustainable growth 

for fiscal year 2013 we generated net sales of 19244 million gross profit of 10496 million or 545 of sales and net income of 3028 million we believe we have achieved steady longterm growth in sales and improvements in operating performance since our formation in 1993 due to our competitive strengths and through execution of our valuedriven operating strategy more specifically focusing our businesses on our valuedriven operating strategy of obtaining profitable new business carefully controlling the cost structure and pricing our highly engineered valueadded products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so has historically resulted in improvements in gross profit and income from operations over the long term 

our selective acquisition strategy has also contributed to the growth of our business the integration of certain acquisitions into our existing businesses combined with implementing our proven operating strategy has historically resulted in improvements of the financial performance of the acquired business 

our key competitive strengths and the elements of our business strategy are set forth in more detail below 

we believe our key competitive strengths include 

large and growing installed product base with aftermarket revenue stream we provide components to a large and growing installed base of aircraft to which we supply aftermarket products we estimate that our products are installed on approximately 90000 commercial transport regional transport military and general aviation fixed wing turbine aircraft and rotary wing aircraft 

diversified revenue base we believe that our diversified revenue base reduces our dependence on any particular product platform or market channel and has been a significant factor in maintaining our financial performance our products are installed on almost all of the major commercial aircraft platforms now in production we expect to continue to develop new products for military and commercial applications 

  

significant barriers to entry  we believe that the niche nature of our markets the industry’s stringent regulatory and certification requirements the large number of products that we sell and the investments necessary to develop and certify products create barriers to entry for potential competitors 

our business strategy is made up of two key elements 1 a valuedriven operating strategy focused around our three core value drivers and 2 a selective acquisition strategy 

valuedriven operating strategy our three core value drivers are 

 

  

  

 selective acquisition strategy we selectively pursue the acquisition of proprietary aerospace component businesses when we see an opportunity to create value through the application of our three core valuedriven operating strategies the aerospace industry in particular remains highly fragmented with many of the companies in the industry being small private businesses or small noncore operations of larger businesses we have significant experience among our management team in executing acquisitions and integrating acquired businesses into our company and culture as of the date of this report we have successfully acquired 46 businesses andor product lines since our formation in 1993 many of these acquisitions have been integrated into an existing transdigm production facility which enables a higher production capacity utilization which in turn improves gross profit levels due to the ability to spread the fixed manufacturing overhead costs over higher production volume

the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income to ebitda and ebitda as defined 

 

  

         

the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to ebitda and ebitda as defined 

 

  

        trend information 

we predominantly serve customers in the commercial regional business jet and general aviation aftermarket which accounts for approximately 39 of total sales the commercial aerospace oem market comprising large commercial transport manufacturers and regional and business jet manufacturers which accounts for approximately 30 of total sales and the defense market which accounts for approximately 25 of total sales nonaerospace sales comprise approximately 6 of our total sales 

  

the commercial aerospace industry including the aftermarket and oem market is impacted by the health of the global economy and geopolitical events around the world the commercial aerospace industry had shown strength with increases in revenue passenger miles or rpms between 2003 and 2008 as well as increases in oem production and backlog however in 2009 the global economic downturn negatively impacted the commercial aerospace industry causing rpms to decline slightly this market sector began to rebound in 2010 and positive growth has continued thru 2013 with increases in rpms as well as the growth in the large commercial oem sector aircraft with 100 or more seats with order announcements by the boeing company and airbus sas leading to planned increases in production the 2014 leading indicators and industry consensus suggest a continuation of current trends in the commercial transport market sector supported by continued rpm growth and increases in production at the oem level 

the defense aerospace market is dependent on government budget constraints the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts it is not necessarily affected by general economic conditions that affect the commercial aerospace industry 

our presence in both the commercial aerospace and military sectors of the aerospace industry may mitigate the impact on our business of any specific industry risk we service a diversified customer base in the commercial and military aerospace industry and we provide components to a diverse installed base of aircraft which mitigates our exposure to any individual airframe platform at times declines in sales in one channel have been offset by increased sales in another however due to differences between the profitability of our products sold to oem and aftermarket customers variation in product mix can cause variation in gross margin 

there are many shortterm factors including inventory corrections unannounced changes in order patterns strikes and mergers and acquisitions that can cause shortterm disruptions in our quarterly shipment patterns as compared to previous quarters and the same periods in prior years as such it can be difficult to determine longerterm trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons to normalize for shortterm fluctuations we tend to look at our performance over several quarters or years of activity rather than discrete shortterm periods 

there are also fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering and delivery requests from quartertoquarter as well as variations in product mix from quartertoquarter that may cause positive or negative variations in gross profit margins since commercial aftermarket sales have historically produced a higher gross margin than sales to commercial oems again in many instances these are timing events between quarters and must be balanced with macro aerospace industry indicators 

commercial aftermarket 

the key growth factors in the commercial aftermarket include worldwide rpms and the size and activity level of the worldwide fleet of aircraft after a decline in rpms in 2009 worldwide rpms returned to growth between 2010 and 2013 and current industry consensus indicates that positive rpm growth will continue in 2014 

commercial oem market 

the commercial transport market sector continued to grow during 2013 our commercial transport oem shipments and revenues generally run ahead of the boeing and airbus airframe delivery schedules as a result and consistent with prior years our fiscal 2014 shipments will be a function of among other things the estimated 2014 and 2015 commercial airframe production rates we are now experiencing increased sales in the large commercial oem sector aircraft with 100 or more seats driven by an increase in production by the boeing company and airbus sas tied to previous order announcements industry consensus indicates this production increase will continue in 2014 and 2015 though the growth may moderate 

  

the business jet oem market significantly declined between 2008 and 2010 impacted by the slowdown in economic growth corporate profits commodity prices and stock market returns across the world however the business jet oem market started to modestly recover in 2011 but has remained sluggish through 2013 and could show modest growth in 2014 

defense 

our military business fluctuates from year to year and is dependent to a degree on government budget constraints the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts in recent years defense spending has reached historic highs due in part to the military engagements in afghanistan and iraq and the war on terrorism we anticipate that military related sales of our types of products could start to decline modestly in future years over the current high levels 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations however investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 

we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations these critical policies were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments our most critical accounting policies are as follows 

revenue recognition and related allowances  revenue is recognized from the sale of products when title and risk of loss passes to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment substantially all product sales are made pursuant to firm fixedprice purchase orders received from customers collectability of amounts recorded as revenue is reasonably assured at the time of sale provisions for returns uncollectible accounts and the cost of repairs under contract warranty provisions are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are principally based on historical results modified as appropriate by the most current information available we have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of such allowances however due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process it is possible that actual results may vary from the estimates and the differences could be material 

management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable and customer creditworthiness the allowance also incorporates a provision for the estimated impact of disputes with customers management’s estimate of the allowance amounts that are necessary includes amounts for specifically identified credit losses and estimated credit losses based on historical information the determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to significant levels of judgment and estimation by management depending on the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues or if the financial condition of any of the company’s customers were to deteriorate and their ability to make required payments were to become impaired increases in these allowances may be required historically changes in estimates in the allowance for doubtful accounts have not been significant 

the company provides limited warranties in connection with the sale of its products the warranty period for products sold which varies among the company’s operations is typically less than two years but can be in the range from 90 days to six years in addition certain contracts with distributors contain right of return provisions the company accrues for estimated returns and warranty claims based on knowledge of product performance issues and based on excess inventories provided by its customers and industry sources the 

  

company also provides a general amount based on historical trends to the extent total warranty claims differ from estimates adjustments may be necessary historically actual product returns and warranty claims have not differed materially from the estimates originally established 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost of inventories is determined by the average cost and the firstin firstout fifo methods for all locations except cef industries llc which determines the cost of inventories using the lastin firstout lifo method because the company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be inservice for 30 or more years it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use where management estimated that the current market value was below cost or determined that future demand was lower than current inventory levels based on historical experience current and projected market demand current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value was made by recording a provision included in cost of sales although management believes that the company’s estimates of excess and obsolete inventory are reasonable actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future in addition in accordance with industry practice all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year historically changes in estimates in the net realizable value of inventories have not been significant 

intangible assets  mergers and acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method and have resulted in significant amounts of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill fair value adjustments to the company’s assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition we generally use thirdparty appraisals to assist us in determining the estimated fair value of the intangible assets 

intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights or if the intangible asset can be sold transferred licensed or exchanged regardless of the company’s intent to do so goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition and are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates 

gaap requires that the annual and any interim impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level the reporting unit level is one level below an operating segment substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each reporting unit pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction with respect to acquisitions integrated into an existing reporting unit any acquired goodwill is combined with the goodwill of the reporting unit 

at the time of goodwill impairment testing management determines the estimated fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit if the calculated estimated fair value is less than the current carrying value impairment of goodwill of the reporting unit may exist the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing includes discount rates growth rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates are set by using the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” methodology the wacc methodology considers market and industry data as well as company specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business 

management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last 

  

projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates as an indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately through the use of the discounted cash flow valuation model the aggregate of all reporting units estimated fair value is reconciled to the total market capitalization of the company 

the company had 24 reporting units with goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 the date of the last annual impairment test the estimated fair values of each of the reporting units was substantially in excess of their respective carrying values by 40 percent or more and therefore no goodwill impairment was recorded the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate which is a significant assumption in the calculation of fair values with a one percentage point increase in the discount rate the reporting units would continue to have fair values in excess of their respective carrying values 

management tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at the asset level as determined by appropriate asset valuation at the time of acquisition the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets consists of a comparison between the estimated fair values and carrying values if the carrying amounts of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives exceed their estimated fair values an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference management utilizes the royalty savings valuation method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset in this method management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset the key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates royalty rates growth rates sales projections and terminal value rates discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the wacc methodology considering any differences in companyspecific risk factors between reporting units and the indefinitelived intangible assets royalty rates are established by management with the advice of valuation experts and periodically substantiated by valuation experts management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant intangible asset terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates 

the discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed actual results could differ from these assumptions management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering the current economic conditions 

stock options  the company accounts for the cost of its stock options in accordance with gaap which requires the measurement of compensation expense under the stock option plan to be based on the estimated fair value of the awards under the plan on the grant dates and amortizes the expense over the vesting periods of the options the company estimates the fair value of all sharebased payments using the blackscholesmerton option pricing model which requires management to make certain assumptions management continuously reviews the following assumptions riskfree interest rates expected life of options expected volatility of stock and expected dividend yield of stock an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside management’s control could have an impact on the company’s results of operations 

environmental matters  the company is involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of its currently and formerly owned sites and at thirdparty sites the company accrues for environmentalrelated activities for which commitments or cleanup plans have been developed and for which costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment all accrued amounts were recorded on an undiscounted basis environmentalrelated expenses include costs of investigation and remediation and fees paid to outside engineering actuarial consulting and law firms due to uncertainties surrounding environmental investigations and remediation activities the company’s ultimate liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued 

income taxes  the company estimates income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates this involves estimating taxable earnings specific taxable and deductible items the likelihood of generating sufficient future 

  

taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits to the extent these estimates change adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes are made in the period in which the changes occur historically such adjustments have not been significant

total company 

net sales  net organic sales acquisition sales and sales of the amsafe distribution business which was acquired as part of amsafe on february 15 2012 and sold on august 16 2012 and the related dollar and percentage changes for the fiscal years ended september 30 2013 and 2012 were as follows amounts in millions 

 

 acquisition sales represent sales of acquired businesses for the period up to one year subsequent to their acquisition dates the amount of acquisition sales shown in the table above was mainly attributable to the acquisition of whippany actuation arkwin and aerosonic in fiscal 2013 and aeroinstruments amsafe and harco in fiscal 2012 

organic sales for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 include a favorable commercial oem retroactive contract pricing adjustment of approximately 2 million organic sales for the fiscal year ended september 30 2012 include favorable commercial oem retroactive contract pricing adjustments of approximately 13 million and a favorable commercial aftermarket retroactive contract pricing adjustment of approximately 6 million 

  

excluding the impact of the retroactive contract pricing adjustments and the amsafe distribution sales indicated above commercial oem sales increased 514 million or an increase of 105 commercial aftermarket sales increased 33 million or an increase of 05 and defense sales increased 331 million or an increase of 83 for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 compared to the fiscal year ended september 30 2012 the commercial aftermarket comparable sales particularly in the second half of fiscal 2013 compared to the second half of fiscal 2012 were negatively impacted by nonmarket items associated with changing past business practices of previouslyacquired businesses changes in distributors and related inventory fluctuations we believe that the underlying demand in the commercial aftermarket channel began to trend up more positively during the second half of the fiscal year 

cost of sales and gross profit  cost of sales increased by 1203 million or 160 to 8748 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 compared to 7545 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2012 cost of sales and the related percentage of total sales for the fiscal years ended september 30 2013 and 2012 were as follows amounts in millions 

 

 the increase in the dollar amount of cost of sales during the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 was primarily due to increased volume associated with the sales from acquisitions and organic sales growth and higher stock compensation expense related to the accelerated vesting discussed further below partially offset by lower acquisitionrelated costs as shown in the table above 

gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased by 11 percentage points to 545 for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 from 556 for the fiscal year ended september 30 2012 the dollar amount of gross profit increased by 1038 million or 110 for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 compared to the comparable period last year due to the following items

 the increase in the dollar amount of selling and administrative expenses during the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 is primarily due to higher selling and administrative expenses relating to recent acquisitions of approximately 25 million which was approximately 14 of the acquisition sales and additional stock compensation expense of approximately 21 million recorded in june 2013 related to the accelerated vesting under the market sweep provision for all options granted prior to october 1 2011 

amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets increased to 456 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 from 442 million for the comparable period last year the net increase of 14 million was primarily due to amortization expense related to the additional identifiable intangible assets recognized in connection with acquisitions during the last twelve months partially offset by order backlog relating to prior acquisitions becoming fully amortized

interest expensenet interest expensenet includes interest on outstanding borrowings amortization of debt issue costs and revolving credit facility fees offset by interest income interest expensenet increased 588 million or 277 to 2707 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 from 2119 million for the comparable period last year the net increase in interest expensenet was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average level of outstanding borrowings which was approximately 463 billion for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 and approximately 344 billion for the fiscal year ended september 30 2012 slightly offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate during the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 of 56 compared to the weighted average interest rate during the comparable prior period of 62 the increase in borrowings was primarily due to the additional 150 million term loan facility under the amendments to our 2011 credit facility which occurred in october 2012 additional borrowings of 364 million relating to our 

  

refinancing of the 2011 credit facility in february 2013 additional borrowings of 900 million relating to the incremental term facility in july 2013 the issuance in october 2012 of our 550 million 2020 notes and the issuance in july 2013 of our 500 million 2021 notes the weighted average interest rate on total outstanding borrowings at september 30 2013 was 54 

income taxes income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately 325 for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 compared to 334 for the fiscal year ended september 30 2012 the company’s effective tax rate for these periods was less than the federal statutory tax rate due primarily to the domestic manufacturing deduction the decrease in the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 compared to the fiscal year ended september 30 2012 was primarily due to the retroactive reinstatement of the research and development tax credit and an increased benefit from the domestic manufacturing deduction 

net income net income decreased 222 million or 68 to 3028 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 compared to net income of 3250 million for the year ended september 30 2012 the decrease in net income was primarily due to the higher interest expensenet discussed above the aftertax impact of 204 million or 037 per share related to the refinancing costs recorded during the period and the aftertax additional stock compensation expense recorded in june 2013 of 166 million or 030 per share related to the accelerated vesting under the market sweep provision for all options granted prior to october 1 2011 the decrease noted above was partially offset by an increase in net income from operations

foreign operations 

although we manufacture a significant portion of our products in the united states we manufacture some products in belgium china malaysia mexico sri lanka and the united kingdom we sell our products in the united states as well as in foreign countries although the majority of sales of our products are made to customers including distributors located in the united states our products are ultimately sold to and used by customers including airlines and other end users of aircraft throughout the world a number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including currency fluctuations difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies restrictions on the repatriation of funds change in trade policies tariff regulation difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition 

our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately 5720 million 5088 million and 3055 million for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks including the impact of foreign government regulations political uncertainties and differences in business practices there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments’ countries furthermore there can be no assurance that the political cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 

inflation 

many of the company’s raw materials and operating expenses are sensitive to the effects of inflation which could result in changing operating costs the effects of inflation on the company’s businesses during the fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 were not significant 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically maintained a capital structure comprising a mix of equity and debt financing we vary our leverage both to optimize our equity return and to pursue acquisitions we expect to meet our current debt obligations as they come due through internally generated funds from current levels of operations andor through refinancing in the debt or equity markets prior to the maturity dates of our debt 

  

we continually evaluate our debt facilities to assess whether they most efficiently and effectively meet the current and future needs of our business the company evaluates from time to time the appropriateness of its current leverage taking into consideration the company’s debt holders equity holders credit ratings acquisition opportunities and other factors the company’s debt leverage ratio which is computed as total debt divided by ebitda as defined for the applicable twelvemonth period has varied widely during the company’s history ranging from approximately 35 to 65 our debt leverage ratio at september 30 2013 was approximately 64 

the company regularly engages in discussions with respect to potential acquisitions and investments however there can be no assurance that the company will be able to consummate an agreement with respect to any future acquisition the company’s acquisition strategy may require substantial capital and no assurance can be given that the company will be able to raise any necessary funds on acceptable terms or at all if the company incurs additional debt to finance acquisitions total interest expense will increase 

if the company has excess cash it may consider methods by which it can provide cash to its debt or equity holders through a dividend prepayment of indebtedness repurchase of stock repurchase of debt or other means whether the company undertakes additional stock repurchases or other aforementioned activities will depend on prevailing market conditions the company’s liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material in addition the company may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so 

the company’s ability to make scheduled interest payments on or to refinance the company’s indebtedness or to fund nonacquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on the company’s ability to generate cash in the future this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control based on its current levels of operations and absent any disruptive events management believes that internally generated funds and borrowings available under our revolving loan facility should provide sufficient resources to finance its operations nonacquisition related capital expenditures research and development efforts and longterm indebtedness obligations through at least fiscal 2014 there can be no assurance however that the company’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to the company under the senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its indebtedness or to fund its other liquidity needs the company may need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness on or before maturity also to the extent the company accelerates its growth plans consummates acquisitions or has lower than anticipated sales or increases in expenses the company may also need to raise additional capital in particular increased working capital needs occur whenever the company consummates acquisitions or experiences strong incremental demand there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the company has not at this time determined to change the nature of its debt facilities however in the future the company may increase its borrowings in connection with acquisitions if cash flow from operations becomes insufficient to fund current operations or for other shortterm cash needs or for stock repurchases or dividends our future leverage will also be impacted by the then current conditions of the credit markets

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

transdigm inc was formed in july 1993 in connection with the acquisition of certain businesses from imo industries inc transdigm group incorporated “td group” was formed in july 2003 to facilitate the acquisition of transdigm inc in march 2006 and may 2007 certain stockholders of td group and certain members of our management sold shares of td group common stock in underwritten public offerings td group did not offer any shares of common stock for sale in the offerings and td group did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders as a result of the initial public offering in 2006 td group’s common stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “tdg” 

we believe we are a leading global designer producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers we estimate that about 90 of our net sales for fiscal year 2012 were generated by proprietary products in addition for fiscal year 2012 we estimate that we generated about 3  4 of our net sales from products for which we are the sole source provider 

most of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue once our parts are designed into and sold on a new aircraft we generate net sales from aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft which is generally estimated to be approximately 30 years a typical platform can be produced for 20 to 30 years giving us an estimated product life cycle of 5060 years we estimate that approximately 55 of our net sales in fiscal year 2012 were generated from aftermarket sales the vast majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets these aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and been more stable than sales to original equipment manufacturers or oems 

  

products 

we primarily design produce and supply highlyengineered proprietary aerospace components and certain systemssubsystems with significant aftermarket content we seek to develop highly customized products to solve specific needs for aircraft operators and manufacturers we attempt to differentiate ourselves based on engineering service and manufacturing capabilities we typically choose not to compete for nonproprietary “build to print” business because it frequently offers lower margins than proprietary products we believe that our products have strong brand names within the industry and that we have a reputation for high quality reliability and customer support 

our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products that we offer to our customers some of our more significant product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and engine technology specialized pumps and valves power conditioning devices specialized acdc electric motors and generators nicad batteries and chargers engineered latching and locking devices rods and locking devices engineered connectors and elastomers cockpit security components and systems specialized cockpit displays aircraft audio systems specialized lavatory components seatbelts and safety restraints engineered interior surfaces and lighting and control technology 

sales and marketing 

consistent with our overall strategy our sales and marketing organization is structured to continually develop technical solutions that meet customer needs in particular we attempt to focus on products and programs that will lead to highmargin repeatable sales in the aftermarket 

we have structured our sales efforts along our major product offerings assigning a product manager to certain products each product manager is expected to grow the sales and profitability of the products for which he or she is responsible and to achieve the targeted annual level of bookings sales new business and profitability for such products the product managers are assisted by account managers and sales engineers who are responsible for covering major oem and aftermarket accounts account managers and sales engineers are expected to be familiar with the personnel organization and needs of specific customers to achieve total bookings and new business goals at each account and together with the product managers to determine when additional resources are required at customer locations most of our sales personnel are evaluated in part on their bookings and their ability to identify and obtain new business opportunities 

though typically performed by employees the account manager function may be performed by independent representatives depending on the specific customer product and geographic location we also use a number of distributors to provide logistical support as well as primary customer contact with certain smaller accounts our major distributors are aviall inc a subsidiary of the boeing company and satair as a subsidiary of airbus 

manufacturing and engineering 

we maintain 35 principal manufacturing facilities most of our manufacturing facilities are comprised of manufacturing distribution and engineering functions and most facilities have certain administrative functions including management sales and finance we continually strive to improve productivity and reduce costs including rationalization of operations developing improved control systems that allow for accurate product profit and loss accounting investing in equipment tooling information systems and implementing broadbased employee training programs management believes that our manufacturing systems and equipment contribute to our ability to compete by permitting us to meet the rigorous tolerances and cost sensitive price structure of aircraft component customers 

  

we attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by producing uniquely engineered products with high quality and timely delivery our engineering costs are recorded in cost of sales and in selling and administrative captions in our consolidated statements of income total engineering expense represents approximately 6 of our operating units’ aggregate costs or approximately 3 of our consolidated net sales our proprietary products and particularly our new product initiatives are designed by our engineers and are intended to serve the needs of the aircraft component industry these proprietary designs must withstand the extraordinary conditions and stresses that will be endured by products during use and meet the rigorous demands of our customers’ tolerance and quality requirements 

we use sophisticated equipment and procedures to comply with quality requirements specifications and federal aviation administration the “faa” and oem requirements we perform a variety of testing procedures including testing under different temperature humidity and altitude levels shock and vibration testing and xray fluorescent measurement these procedures together with other customer approved techniques for document process and quality control are used throughout our manufacturing facilities 

customers 

our customers include 1 distributors of aerospace components 2 worldwide commercial airlines including national and regional airlines 3 large commercial transport and regional and business aircraft oems 4 various armed forces of the united states and friendly foreign governments 5 defense oems 6 system suppliers and 7 various other industrial customers for the year ended september 30 2012 boeing which includes aviall inc a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world accounted for approximately 13 of our net sales our top ten customers for fiscal year 2012 accounted for approximately 43 of our net sales products supplied to many of our customers are used on multiple platforms 

active commercial production programs include the boeing 737 747 767 777 and 787 the airbus a3192021 a330a340 and a380 the bombardier crj’s challenger and learjets the embraer rj’s the cessna citation family the raytheon premier and hawker and most gulfstream airframes military platforms include aircraft such as the boeing c17 f15 f18 and v22 the lockheed martin c130j f16 and f35 joint strikefighter the northrop grumman e2c hawkeye the uh60 blackhawk ch47 chinook and ah64 apache helicopters the general atomics predator drone and the raytheon patriot missile transdigm has been awarded numerous contracts for the development of engineered products for production on the airbus a350xwb a320 neo and a400m programs the bombardier learjet 85 the sikorsky s97 and boeing p8 poseidon 

we believe that we have strong customer relationships with almost all large commercial transport regional general aviation and military oems the demand for our aftermarket parts and services depends on among other things the breadth of our installed oem base revenue passenger miles “rpms” the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and to a lesser extent airline profitability we believe that we are also a leading supplier of components used on us—designed military aircraft including components that are used on a variety of fighter aircraft military freighters and military helicopters 

competition 

the niche markets within the aerospace industry that we serve are relatively fragmented and we face several competitors for many of the products and services we provide due to the global nature of the commercial aircraft industry competition in these categories comes from both us and foreign companies competitors in our product offerings range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privatelyheld entities with only one or two components in their entire product portfolios 

we compete on the basis of engineering manufacturing and marketing high quality products which we believe meet or exceed the performance and maintenance requirements of our customers consistent and timely delivery and superior customer service and support the industry’s stringent regulatory certification and 

  

technical requirements and the investments necessary in the development and certification of products create barriers to entry for potential new competitors as long as customers receive products that meet or exceed expectations and performance standards we believe that they will have a reduced incentive to certify another supplier because of the cost and time of the technical design and testing certification process in addition we believe that the availability dependability and safety of our products are reasons for our customers to continue longterm supplier relationships 

government contracts 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 1 suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations 2 terminate existing contracts 3 reduce the value of existing contracts 4 audit our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs and 5 control and potentially prohibit the export of our products 

governmental regulation 

the commercial aircraft component industry is highly regulated by both the faa in the united states and by the joint aviation authorities in europe and other agencies throughout the world while the military aircraft component industry is governed by military quality specifications we and the components we manufacture are required to be certified by one or more of these entities or agencies and in many cases by individual oems in order to engineer and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models 

we must also satisfy the requirements of our customers including oems and airlines that are subject to faa regulations and provide these customers with products and services that comply with the government regulations applicable to commercial flight operations in addition the faa requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components we believe that we currently satisfy or exceed these maintenance standards in our repair and overhaul services we also maintain several faa approved repair stations 

in addition sales of many of our products that will be used on aircraft owned by nonus entities are subject to compliance with us export control laws 

our operations are also subject to a variety of worker and community safety laws the occupational safety and health act “osha” mandates general requirements for safe workplaces for all employees in addition osha provides special procedures and measures for the handling of certain hazardous and toxic substances 

raw materials 

we require the use of various raw materials in our manufacturing processes we also purchase a variety of manufactured component parts from various suppliers at times we concentrate our orders among a few suppliers in order to strengthen our supplier relationships raw materials and component parts are generally available from multiple suppliers at competitive prices 

intellectual property 

we have various trade secrets proprietary information trademarks trade names patents copyrights and other intellectual property rights which we believe in the aggregate but not individually are important to our business 

  

backlog 

as of september 30 2012 the company estimated its sales order backlog at 833 million compared to an estimated sales order backlog of 737 million as of september 30 2011 the increase in backlog is primarily due to the acquisitions of aeroinstruments harco and amsafe discussed below totaling approximately 62 million and an increase in orders across existing oem product lines and to a lesser extent the aftermarket the majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of september 30 2012 are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months purchase orders may be subject to cancellation or deferral by the customer prior to shipment the level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of the company’s receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled accordingly the company’s backlog as of september 30 2012 may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period 

foreign operations 

although we manufacture a significant portion of our products in the united states we manufacture some products in belgium china malaysia mexico sri lanka and the united kingdom we sell our products in the united states as well as in foreign countries although the majority of sales of our products are made to customers including distributors located in the united states our products are ultimately sold to and used by customers including airlines and other end users of aircraft throughout the world a number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including currency fluctuations difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies restrictions on the repatriation of funds change in trade policies tariff regulation difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition 

our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately 5088 million 3055 million and 1706 million for fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks including the impact of foreign government regulations political uncertainties and differences in business practices there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments’ countries furthermore there can be no assurance that the political cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 

environmental matters 

our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things discharges of pollutants into the air and water the generation handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees environmental laws and regulations may require that the company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations certain facilities and thirdparty sites utilized by subsidiaries of the company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws the company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws 

estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are based on current facts laws regulations and technology these estimates take into consideration the company’s prior experience and professional judgment of the company’s environmental specialists estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination the range of remediation alternatives available evolving remediation standards imprecise engineering evaluations and cost estimates the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 

accordingly as investigation and remediation proceed it is likely that adjustments in the company’s accruals will be necessary to reflect new information the amounts of any such adjustments could have a 

  

material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in a given period based on currently available information however the company does not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition 

environmental liabilities are recorded when the liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable which generally is not later than at completion of a feasibility study or when the company has recommended a remedy or has committed to an appropriate plan of action the liabilities are reviewed periodically and as investigation and remediation proceed adjustments are made as necessary liabilities for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not consider the effects of inflation and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value the liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties but do reflect anticipated allocations among potentially responsible parties at federal superfund sites or similar statemanaged sites third party indemnity obligations and an assessment of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their obligations at such sites 

employees 

as of september 30 2012 we had approximately 5400 full time part time and temporary employees approximately 12 of our employees were represented by labor unions collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire at various dates ranging from november 2012 to april 2016 we consider our relationship with our employees generally to be satisfactory 

legal proceedings 

we are from time to time subject to and are presently involved in litigation or other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business based upon information currently known to us we believe the outcome of such proceedings will not have individually or in the aggregate a material adverse effect on our business our financial condition or results of operations 

available information 

td group’s annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k including any amendments will be made available free of charge on the company’s website wwwtransdigmcom  as soon as reasonably practicable following the filing of the reports with the securities and exchange commission

 item 1a risk factors tableend set forth below are important risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business and financial condition and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

our business is sensitive to the number of flight hours that our customers’ planes spend aloft the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and our customers’ profitability these items are in turn affected by general economic conditions 

our business is directly affected by among other factors changes in revenue passenger miles rpms the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and to a lesser extent changes in the profitability of the commercial airline industry rpms and airline profitability have historically been correlated with the general economic environment although national and international events also play a key role for example in the recent past the airline industry has been severely affected by the downturn in the global economy higher fuel prices the increased security concerns among airline customers following the events of september 11 2001 the severe 

  

acute respiratory syndrome or sars epidemic and the conflicts in afghanistan and iraq in addition global market and economic conditions have been challenging with continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies and have prolonged declines in business and consumer spending as a result of the substantial reduction in airline traffic resulting from these events the airline industry incurred large losses and financial difficulties some carriers have also parked or retired a portion of their fleets and have reduced workforces and flights during periods of reduced airline profitability some airlines may delay purchases of spare parts preferring instead to deplete existing inventories if demand for new aircraft and spare parts decreases there would be a decrease in demand for certain of our products 

our sales to manufacturers of aircraft are cyclical and a downturn in sales to these manufacturers may adversely affect us 

our sales to manufacturers of large commercial aircraft such as the boeing company airbus sas and related oem suppliers as well as manufacturers of business jets which accounted for approximately 26 of our net sales in fiscal year 2012 have historically experienced periodic downturns in the past these sales have been affected by airline profitability which is impacted by among other things fuel and labor costs price competition downturns in the global economy and national and international events such as the events of september 11 2001 in addition sales of our products to manufacturers of business jets are impacted by among other things downturns in the global economy prior downturns have adversely affected our net sales gross margin and net income 

we rely heavily on certain customers for much of our sales 

our largest customer for fiscal year 2012 was the boeing company which includes aviall inc a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world boeing accounted for approximately 13 of our net sales in fiscal year 2012 our top ten customers for fiscal year 2012 accounted for approximately 43 of our net sales a reduction in purchasing by one of our larger customers for any reason such as economic downturn decreased production or strike could have a material adverse effect on our net sales gross margin and net income 

we generally do not have guaranteed future sales of our products further when we enter into fixed price contracts with some of our customers we take the risk for cost overruns 

as is customary in our business we do not generally have longterm contracts with most of our aftermarket customers and therefore do not have guaranteed future sales although we have longterm contracts with many of our oem customers many of those customers may terminate the contracts on short notice and in most cases our customers have not committed to buy any minimum quantity of our products in addition in certain cases we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon the historic purchasing patterns of customers and upon our discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements and this anticipated future volume of orders may not materialize 

we also have entered into multiyear fixedprice contracts with some of our customers pursuant to which we have agreed to perform the work for a fixed price and accordingly realize all the benefit or detriment resulting from any decreases or increases in the costs of making these products sometimes we accept a fixedprice contract for a product that we have not yet produced and this increases the risk of cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product most of our contracts do not permit us to recover increases in raw material prices taxes or labor costs 

us military spending is dependent upon the us defense budget 

the military and defense market is significantly dependent upon government budget trends particularly the us department of defense the “dod” budget in addition to normal business risks our supply of products to the united states government is subject to unique risks largely beyond our control future dod budgets could 

  

be negatively impacted by several factors including but not limited to a change in defense spending policy by the current presidential administration the us government’s budget deficits spending priorities the cost of sustaining the us military presence in the middle east and possible political pressure to reduce us government military spending each of which could cause the dod budget to remain unchanged or to decline a significant decline in us military expenditures in the future could result in a reduction in the amount of our products sold to the various agencies and buying organizations of the us government 

we intend to pursue future acquisitions our business may be adversely affected if we cannot consummate acquisitions on satisfactory terms or if we cannot effectively integrate acquired operations 

a significant portion of our growth has occurred through acquisitions any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions we intend to pursue acquisitions that we believe will present opportunities consistent with our overall business strategy however we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates to purchase or may be unable to acquire desired businesses or assets on economically acceptable terms in addition we may not be able to raise the capital necessary to fund future acquisitions because we may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously we may encounter unforeseen expenses complications and delays including difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight 

we regularly engage in discussions with respect to potential acquisition and investment opportunities if we consummate an acquisition our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly future acquisitions could likely result in the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest and amortization expenses or periodic impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets as well as significant charges relating to integration costs 

acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect in addition we may not be able to successfully integrate any business we acquire into our existing business the successful integration of new businesses depends on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs the successful integration of future acquisitions may also require substantial attention from our senior management and the management of the acquired business which could decrease the time that they have to service attract customers and develop new products and services or attend to other acquisition opportunities 

we are subject to certain unique business risks as a result of supplying equipment and services to the us government 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 

 

  

  

  

 most of our us government contracts can be terminated by the us government for its convenience without significant notice termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination 

  

on contracts for which the price is based on cost the us government may review our costs and performance as well as our accounting and general business practices based on the results of such audits the us government may adjust our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs in addition under us government purchasing regulations some of our costs including most financing costs amortization of intangible assets portions of research and development costs and certain marketing expenses may not be subject to reimbursement 

in addition even where the price is not based on cost the us government may seek to review our costs to determine whether our pricing is “fair and reasonable” five of our subsidiaries and divisions were subject to such a pricing review for years 2002 through 2004 and it is possible that we will be subject to a similar pricing review in the future such a review could be costly and time consuming for our management and could distract from our ability to effectively manage the business as a result of such a review we could be subject to providing a refund to the us government or we could be asked to enter into an arrangement whereby our prices would be based on cost or the dod could seek to pursue alternative sources of supply for our parts any of those occurrences could lead to a reduction in our revenue from or the profitability of certain of our supply arrangements with certain agencies and buying organizations of the us government 

our business may be adversely affected if we would lose our government or industry approvals or if more stringent government regulations are enacted or if industry oversight is increased 

the aerospace industry is highly regulated in the united states and in other countries in order to sell our components we and the components we manufacture must be certified by the faa the dod and similar agencies in foreign countries and by individual manufacturers if new and more stringent government regulations are adopted or if industry oversight increases we might incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or heightened industry oversight in addition if material authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended our business would be adversely affected 

in addition to the aviation approvals we are at times required to obtain approval from us government agencies to export our products additionally we are not permitted to export some of our products a determination by the us government that we failed to receive required approvals or licenses could eliminate or restrict our ability to sell our products outside the united states and the penalties that could be imposed by the us government for failure to comply with these laws could be significant 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and could harm our ability to react to changes to our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of september 30 2012 our total indebtedness was approximately 36191 million which was approximately 748 of our total capitalization 

in addition we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future for example as of september 30 2012 we had approximately 3029 million of unused commitments under our revolving loan facility although our senior secured credit facility and the indentures together with the indenture governing the 5 1  2  notes discussed below the “indentures” governing the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes issued in december 2010 the “7 3  4  senior subordinated notes” contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these qualifications and exceptions could be substantial if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage would increase 

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to investors for example it could 

 

   

  

  

  

 in addition all of our debt under the senior secured credit facility which includes a 202 billion term loan facility and a revolving loan facility of 3100 million bears interest at floating rates accordingly in the event that interest rates increase our debt service expense will also increase in order to reduce the floating interest rate risk as of september 30 2012 the company was party to three forward starting interest rate swap agreements that fix the rate of interest beginning december 31 2012 through june 30 2015 on an aggregate notional amount of 353 million of debt under the senior secured credit facility 

on october 9 2012 the company amended the secured credit facility to provide for an additional term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of 150 million the additional term loan facility was fully drawn on october 15 2012 the company also issued 550 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5 1  2  senior subordinated notes due 2020 the “5 1  2  senior subordinated notes” at an issue price of 100 of the principal amount on october 15 2012 

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness including the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes as well as the 5 1  2  senior subordinated notes we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital 

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make payments on our indebtedness including the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes as well as the 5 1  2  senior subordinated notes and amounts borrowed under the credit facilities and to fund our operations will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future which to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot assure you however that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness including the amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility and the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes as well as the 5 1  2  senior subordinated notes or to fund our other liquidity needs if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital we cannot assure you that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us 

  

to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations the terms of existing or future debt instruments the indentures and the senior secured credit facility may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives in addition any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms and would otherwise adversely affect the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes as well as the 5 1  2  senior subordinated notes 

the terms of the senior secured credit facility and indentures may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

our senior secured credit facility and the indentures contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indentures and may limit their ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests the senior secured credit facility and indentures include covenants restricting among other things the ability of td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indentures to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the indentures if any such default occurs the lenders under the senior secured credit facility and the holders of the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes as well as the 5 1  2  senior subordinated notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder to be immediately due and payable the lenders under the senior secured credit facility also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings in addition following an event of default under the senior secured credit facility the lenders under that facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which includes our available cash and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes as well as the 5 1  2  senior subordinated notes if the debt under the senior secured credit facility or the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes as well as the 5 1  2  senior subordinated notes were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations 

our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things discharges of pollutants into the air and water the generation handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the remediation of contamination and the 

  

health and safety of our employees environmental laws and regulations may require that the company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations certain facilities and thirdparty sites utilized by subsidiaries of the company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws the company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws 

estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are based on current facts laws regulations and technology these estimates take into consideration the company’s prior experience and professional judgment of the company’s environmental specialists estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination the range of remediation alternatives available evolving remediation standards imprecise engineering evaluations and cost estimates the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 

accordingly as investigation and remediation proceed it is likely that adjustments in the company’s accruals will be necessary to reflect new information the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in a given period based on currently available information however the company does not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition 

environmental liabilities are recorded when the liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable which generally is not later than at completion of a feasibility study or when the company has recommended a remedy or has committed to an appropriate plan of action the liabilities are reviewed periodically and as investigation and remediation proceed adjustments are made as necessary liabilities for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not consider the effects of inflation and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value the liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties but do reflect anticipated allocations among potentially responsible parties at federal superfund sites or similar statemanaged sites third party indemnity obligations and an assessment of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their obligations at such sites 

we are dependent on our highly trained employees and any work stoppage or difficulty hiring similar employees could adversely affect our business 

because our products are complicated and highly engineered we depend on an educated and trained workforce there is substantial competition for skilled personnel in the aircraft component industry and we could be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled employees we may not be able to fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover or attract and retain qualified personnel 

as of september 30 2012 we had approximately 5400 full time part time and temporary employees approximately 12 of our employees were represented by labor unions collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire at various dates ranging from november 2012 to april 2016 we consider our relationship with our employees generally to be satisfactory although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory we cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory renewal of these collective bargaining agreements or that our employee relations will remain stable because we maintain a relatively small inventory of finished goods any work stoppage could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide products to our customers 

our business is dependent on the availability of certain components and raw materials from suppliers 

our business is affected by the price and availability of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our components our business therefore could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our 

  

suppliers such as the destruction of our suppliers’ facilities or their distribution infrastructure a work stoppage or strike by our suppliers’ employees or the failure of our suppliers to provide materials of the requisite quality or by increased costs of such raw materials or components if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers because we maintain a relatively small inventory of raw materials and component parts our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers or alternative raw materials or component parts the lengthy and expensive faa and oem certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier raw material or component part 

our facilities are located near known earthquake fault zones and the occurrence of an earthquake or other natural disaster could cause damage to our facilities and equipment which could require us to curtail or cease operations 

a number of our manufacturing facilities are located in the greater los angeles area an area known for earthquakes and are thus vulnerable to damage we are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters including power loss fire explosions floods communications failures terrorist attacks and similar events if any disaster were to occur our ability to operate our business at our facilities could be impaired 

we have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets which may never generate the returns we expect 

mergers and acquisitions have resulted in significant increases in identifiable intangible assets and goodwill identifiable intangible assets which primarily include trademarks trade names trade secrets license agreements and technology were approximately 11236 million at september 30 2012 representing approximately 21 of our total assets goodwill recognized in accounting for the mergers and acquisitions was approximately 30355 million at september 30 2012 representing approximately 56 of our total assets we may never realize the full value of our identifiable intangible assets and goodwill and to the extent we were to determine that our identifiable intangible assets or our goodwill were impaired within the meaning of applicable accounting standards we would be required to writeoff the amount of any impairment 

we face significant competition 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry and compete against a number of companies competitors in our product lines are both us and foreign companies and range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privately held entities we believe that our ability to compete depends on high product performance consistent high quality short leadtime and timely delivery competitive pricing superior customer service and support and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs we may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive 

we could be adversely affected if one of our components causes an aircraft to crash 

our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we have designed manufactured or serviced while we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future products liability claims in the event of product liability claims our insurers may attempt to deny coverage or any coverage we have may not be adequate we also may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost any liability not covered by insurance or for which third party indemnification is not available could result in significant liability to us 

in addition a crash caused by one of our components could damage our reputation for quality products we believe our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting a provider of aircraft components if a crash were to be caused by one of our components or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected 

  

our stock price may be volatile and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 

there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities which is unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities these broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the purchase price due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects including possible changes due to the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry and other factors such as fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering which could cause shortterm swings in profit margins or unrelated to our operating performance including market conditions affecting the stock market generally or the stocks of aerospace companies more specifically 

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our share price 

we may sell additional shares of common stock into the public markets or issue convertible debt securities to raise capital in the future the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public markets or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities to raise capital at a time and price that we deem appropriate 

our corporate documents and delaware law contain certain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable for example our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 149600000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock without stockholder approval the board of directors has the authority to attach special rights including voting and dividend rights to this preferred stock with these rights holders of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us in addition our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered board of directors whereby directors serve for threeyear terms with approximately onethird of the directors coming up for reelection each year having a staggered board will make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of our board of directors through a proxy contest which may be a necessary step in an acquisition of us that is not favored by our board of directors our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75 of the voting power of our issued and outstanding capital stock voting together as a single class is required for the alteration amendment or repeal of certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation including the provisions authorizing a staggered board and certain provisions of our amended and restated bylaws including the provisions relating to our stockholders’ ability to call special meetings notice provisions for stockholder business to be conducted at an annual meeting requests for stockholder lists and corporate records nomination and removal of directors and filling of vacancies on our board of directors 

we are also subject to the antitakeover provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law under these provisions if anyone becomes an “interested stockholder” we may not enter into a “business combination” with that person for three years without special approval which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change of control for purposes of section 203 “interested stockholder” means generally someone owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years subject to certain exceptions as described in section 203 

we do not pay regular quarterly or annual cash dividends on our stock 

on october 15 2012 the company’s board of directors authorized and declared a special cash dividend of 1285 on each outstanding share of common stock and cash dividend equivalent payments under certain of its 

  

stock option plans the special cash dividend amounting to approximately 6635 million was paid in november 2012 and dividend equivalent payments amounting to approximately 360 million will be paid prior to december 31 2012 the company declared and paid a special cash dividend of 765 on each outstanding share of common stock in october 2009 

notwithstanding the special cash dividends paid in october 2009 and november 2012 we do not anticipate declaring or paying regular quarterly or annual cash dividends on our common stock or any other equity security in the foreseeable future the amounts that may be available to us to pay cash dividends are restricted under our debt and other agreements any payment of cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations earnings capital requirements financial condition future prospects contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors therefore you should not rely on quarterly or annual dividend income from shares of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected financial data” and td group’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report the following discussion may contain predictions estimates and other forwardlooking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties including those discussed under the heading entitled “risk factors” included elsewhere in this report these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 

overview 

we believe we are a leading global designer producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers some of our more significant product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and engine technology specialized pumps and valves power conditioning devices specialized acdc electric motors and generators nicad batteries and chargers engineered latching and locking devices rods and locking devices engineered connectors and elastomers cockpit security components and systems specialized cockpit displays aircraft audio systems specialized lavatory components seatbelts and safety restraints engineered interior surfaces and lighting and control technology each of these product offerings is composed of many individual products that are typically customized to meet the needs of a particular aircraft platform or customer 

longterm sustainable growth 

for fiscal year 2012 we generated net sales of 17002 million gross profit of 9457 million or 556 of sales and net income of 3250 million we believe we have achieved steady longterm growth in sales and improvements in operating performance since our formation in 1993 due to our competitive strengths and through execution of our valuedriven operating strategy more specifically focusing our businesses on our valuedriven operating strategy of obtaining profitable new business carefully controlling the cost structure and pricing our highly engineered valueadded products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so has historically resulted in improvements in gross profit and income from operations over the long term 

our selective acquisition strategy has also contributed to the growth of our business the integration of certain acquisitions into our existing businesses combined with implementing our proven operating strategy has historically resulted in improvements of the financial performance of the acquired business 

our key competitive strengths and the elements of our business strategy are set forth in more detail below 

we believe our key competitive strengths include 

large and growing installed product base with aftermarket revenue stream we provide components to a large and growing installed base of aircraft to which we supply aftermarket products we estimate that our products are installed on approximately 70000 commercial transport regional transport military and general aviation fixed wing turbine aircraft and rotary wing aircraft 

diversified revenue base we believe that our diversified revenue base reduces our dependence on any particular product platform or market channel and has been a significant factor in maintaining our financial performance our products are installed on almost all of the major commercial aircraft platforms now in production we expect to continue to develop new products for military and commercial applications 

  

significant barriers to entry  we believe that the niche nature of our markets the industry’s stringent regulatory and certification requirements the large number of products that we sell and the investments necessary to develop and certify products create barriers to entry for potential competitors 

our business strategy is made up of two key elements 1 a valuedriven operating strategy focused around our three core value drivers and 2 a selective acquisition strategy 

valuedriven operating strategy our three core value drivers are 

 

  

  

 selective acquisition strategy we selectively pursue the acquisition of proprietary aerospace component businesses when we see an opportunity to create value through the application of our three core valuedriven operating strategies the aerospace industry in particular remains highly fragmented with many of the companies in the industry being small private businesses or small noncore operations of larger businesses we have significant experience among our management team in executing acquisitions and integrating acquired businesses into our company and culture as of the date of this report we have successfully acquired and integrated 39 businesses andor product lines since our formation in 1993 many of these acquisitions have been integrated into an existing transdigm production facility which enables a higher production capacity utilization which in turn improves gross profit levels due to the ability to spread the fixed manufacturing overhead costs over higher production volume

the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income to ebitda and ebitda as defined 

 

  

         

the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to ebitda and ebitda as defined 

 

  

        trend information 

we predominantly serve customers in the commercial regional business jet and general aviation aftermarket which accounts for approximately 42 of total sales the commercial aerospace oem market comprising large commercial transport manufacturers and regional and business jet manufacturers which accounts for approximately 29 of total sales and the defense market which accounts for approximately 23 of total sales nonaerospace sales comprise approximately 6 of our total sales 

  

the commercial aerospace industry including the aftermarket and oem market is impacted by the health of the global economy and geopolitical events around the world the commercial aerospace industry had shown strength with increases in revenue passenger miles or rpms between 2003 and 2008 as well as increases in oem production and backlog however in 2009 the global economic downturn negatively impacted the commercial aerospace industry causing rpms to decline slightly this market sector began to rebound in 2010 and positive growth has continued thru 2012 with increases in rpms as well as the growth in the large commercial oem sector aircraft with 100 or more seats with order announcements by the boeing company and airbus sas leading to planned increases in production the 2013 leading indicators and industry consensus suggest a modest continuation of current trends in the commercial transport market sector supported by continued modest rpm growth and increases in production at the oem level 

the defense aerospace market is dependent on government budget constraints the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts it is not necessarily affected by general economic conditions that affect the commercial aerospace industry 

our presence in both the commercial aerospace and military sectors of the aerospace industry may mitigate the impact on our business of any specific industry risk we service a diversified customer base in the commercial and military aerospace industry and we provide components to a diverse installed base of aircraft which mitigates our exposure to any individual airframe platform at times declines in sales in one channel have been offset by increased sales in another however due to differences between the profitability of our products sold to oem and aftermarket customers variation in product mix can cause variation in gross margin 

there are many shortterm factors including inventory corrections unannounced changes in order patterns strikes and mergers and acquisitions that can cause shortterm disruptions in our quarterly shipment patterns as compared to previous quarters and the same periods in prior years as such it can be difficult to determine longerterm trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons to normalize for shortterm fluctuations we tend to look at our performance over several quarters or years of activity rather than discrete shortterm periods 

there are also fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering and delivery requests from quartertoquarter as well as variations in product mix from quartertoquarter that may cause positive or negative variations in gross profit margins since commercial aftermarket sales have historically produced a higher gross margin than sales to commercial oems again in many instances these are timing events between quarters and must be balanced with macro aerospace industry indicators 

commercial aftermarket 

the key growth factors in the commercial aftermarket include worldwide rpms and the size and activity level of the worldwide fleet of aircraft after a decline in rpms in 2009 worldwide rpms returned to growth between 2010 and 2012 and current industry consensus indicates that positive rpm growth will continue in 2013 

commercial oem market 

conditions in the commercial transport market sector continued to improve during 2012 our commercial transport oem shipments and revenues generally run ahead of the boeing and airbus airframe delivery schedules as a result and consistent with prior years our fiscal 2013 shipments will be a function of among other things the estimated 2013 and 2014 commercial airframe production rates we are now experiencing increased sales in the large commercial oem sector aircraft with 100 or more seats driven by an increase in production by the boeing company and airbus sas tied to previous order announcements industry consensus indicates this production increase will continue in 2013 and 2014 

the business jet oem market significantly declined between 2008 and 2010 impacted by the slowdown in economic growth corporate profits commodity prices and stock market returns across the world however the 

  

business jet oem market started to recover in 2011 continued this recovery in 2012 and is expected to continue to show modest growth in 2013 

defense 

our military business fluctuates from year to year and is dependent to a degree on government budget constraints the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts in recent years defense spending has reached historic highs due in part to the military engagements in afghanistan and iraq and the war on terrorism we anticipate that military related sales of our types of products could start to decline modestly in future years over the current high levels 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations however investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 

we have identified the following as the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial status depends these critical policies were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments our most critical accounting policies are as follows 

revenue recognition and related allowances  revenue is recognized from the sale of products when title and risk of loss passes to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment substantially all sales are made pursuant to firm fixedprice purchase orders received from customers collectability of amounts recorded as revenue is reasonably assured at the time of sale provisions for returns uncollectible accounts and the cost of repairs under contract warranty provisions are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are principally based on historical results modified as appropriate by the most current information available we have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of such allowances however due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process it is possible that actual results may vary from the estimates and the differences could be material 

management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable and customer creditworthiness the allowance also incorporates a provision for the estimated impact of disputes with customers management’s estimate of the allowance amounts that are necessary includes amounts for specifically identified credit losses and estimated credit losses based on historical information the determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to significant levels of judgment and estimation by management depending on the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues or if the financial condition of any of the company’s customers were to deteriorate and their ability to make required payments were to become impaired increases in these allowances may be required historically changes in estimates in the allowance for doubtful accounts have not been significant 

the company provides limited warranties in connection with the sale of its products the warranty period for products sold which varies among the company’s operations is typically less than two years but can be in the range from 90 days to six years in addition certain contracts with distributors contain right of return provisions the company accrues for estimated returns and warranty claims based on knowledge of product performance issues and based on excess inventories provided by its customers and industry sources the company also provides a general amount based on historical trends to the extent total warranty claims differ from estimates adjustments may be necessary historically actual product returns and warranty claims have not differed materially from the estimates originally established 

  

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost of inventories is determined by the average cost and the firstin firstout fifo methods for all locations except cef industries llc which determines the cost of inventories using the lastin firstout lifo method because the company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be inservice for 30 or more years it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use where management estimated that the current market value was below cost or determined that future demand was lower than current inventory levels based on historical experience current and projected market demand current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value was made by recording a provision included in cost of sales although management believes that the company’s estimates of excess and obsolete inventory are reasonable actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future in addition in accordance with industry practice all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year historically changes in estimates in the net realizable value of inventories have not been significant 

intangible assets  mergers and acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method and have resulted in significant amounts of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill fair value adjustments to the company’s assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition we generally use thirdparty appraisals to assist us in determining the estimated fair value of the intangible assets 

intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights or if the intangible asset can be sold transferred licensed or exchanged regardless of the company’s intent to do so goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition and are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates 

gaap requires that the annual and any interim impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level the reporting unit level is the operating subsidiary level for the company substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each operating subsidiary pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction and therefore the allocation of goodwill among reporting units was immaterial for purposes of the impairment assessment with respect to acquisitions integrated into an existing operating subsidiary any related goodwill is combined with goodwill of the operating subsidiary 

at the time of goodwill impairment testing management determines the estimated fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit if the calculated estimated fair value is less than the current carrying value impairment of goodwill of the reporting unit may exist the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing includes discount rates growth rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates are set by using the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” methodology the wacc methodology considers market and industry data as well as company specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business 

operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates as an indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately through the use of the discounted cash flow valuation model the aggregate of all reporting units estimated fair value is reconciled to the total market capitalization of the company 

  

the company had 22 reporting units with goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 the date of the last annual impairment test the estimated fair values of each of the reporting units was substantially in excess of their respective carrying values by more than 20 percent and therefore no goodwill impairment was recorded the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate which is a significant assumption in the calculation of fair values with a one percentage point increase in the discount rate the reporting units would continue to have fair values in excess of their respective carrying values 

management tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at the asset level as determined by appropriate asset valuation at the time of acquisition the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets consists of a comparison between the estimated fair values and carrying values if the carrying amounts of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives exceed their estimated fair values an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference management utilizes the royalty savings valuation method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset in this method management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset the key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates royalty rates growth rates sales projections and terminal value rates discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the wacc methodology considering any differences in companyspecific risk factors between reporting units and the indefinitelived intangible assets royalty rates are established by management with the advice of valuation experts and periodically substantiated by valuation experts operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant intangible asset terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates 

the discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed actual results could differ from these assumptions management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering the current economic conditions 

stock options  the company accounts for the cost of its stock options in accordance with gaap which requires the measurement of compensation expense under the stock option plan to be based on the estimated fair value of the awards under the plan on the grant dates and amortizes the expense over the vesting periods of the options the company estimates the fair value of all sharebased payments using the blackscholesmerton option pricing model which requires management to make certain assumptions management continuously reviews the following assumptions riskfree interest rates expected life of options expected volatility of stock and expected dividend yield of stock an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside management’s control could have an impact on the company’s results of operations 

environmental matters  the company is involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of its currently and formerly owned sites and at thirdparty sites the company accrues for environmentalrelated activities for which commitments or cleanup plans have been developed and for which costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment all accrued amounts were recorded on an undiscounted basis environmentalrelated expenses include costs of investigation and remediation and fees paid to outside engineering actuarial consulting and law firms due to uncertainties surrounding environmental investigations and remediation activities the company’s ultimate liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued 

income taxes  the company estimates income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates this involves estimating taxable earnings specific taxable and deductible items the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits to the extent these estimates change adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes are made in the period in which the changes occur historically such adjustments have not been significant

foreign operations 

although we manufacture a significant portion of our products in the united states we manufacture some products in belgium china malaysia mexico sri lanka and the united kingdom we sell our products in the united states as well as in foreign countries although the majority of sales of our products are made to customers including distributors located in the united states our products are ultimately sold to and used by customers including airlines and other end users of aircraft throughout the world a number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including currency fluctuations difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies restrictions on the repatriation of funds change in trade policies tariff regulation difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition 

our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately 5088 million 3055 million and 1706 million for fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks including the impact of foreign government regulations political uncertainties and differences in 

  

business practices there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments’ countries furthermore there can be no assurance that the political cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 

inflation 

many of the company’s raw materials and operating expenses are sensitive to the effects of inflation which could result in changing operating costs the effects of inflation on the company’s businesses during the fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 were not significant 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically maintained a capital structure comprising a mix of equity and debt financing we vary our leverage both to optimize our equity return and to pursue acquisitions we expect to meet our current debt obligations as they come due through internally generated funds from current levels of operations andor through refinancing in the debt or equity markets prior to the maturity dates of our debt 

we continually evaluate our debt facilities to assess whether they most efficiently and effectively meet the current and future needs of our business the company evaluates from time to time the appropriateness of its current leverage taking into consideration the company’s debt holders equity holders credit ratings acquisition opportunities and other factors the company’s debt leverage ratio which is computed as total debt divided by ebitda as defined for the applicable twelvemonth period has varied widely during the company’s history ranging from approximately 35 to 65 our debt leverage ratio for the fiscal year ended september 30 2012 was approximately 45 

the company regularly engages in discussions with respect to potential acquisitions and investments however there can be no assurance that the company will be able to consummate an agreement with respect to any future acquisition the company’s acquisition strategy may require substantial capital and no assurance can be given that the company will be able to raise any necessary funds on acceptable terms or at all if the company incurs additional debt to finance acquisitions total interest expense will increase 

if the company has excess cash it may consider methods by which it can provide cash to its debt or equity holders through a dividend prepayment of indebtedness repurchase of stock repurchase of debt or other means whether the company undertakes additional stock repurchases or other aforementioned activities will depend on prevailing market conditions the company’s liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material in addition the company may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so 

the company’s ability to make scheduled interest payments on or to refinance the company’s indebtedness or to fund nonacquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on the company’s ability to generate cash in the future this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control based on its current levels of operations and absent any disruptive events management believes that internally generated funds and borrowings available under our revolving loan facility should provide sufficient resources to finance its operations nonacquisition related capital expenditures research and development efforts and longterm indebtedness obligations through at least fiscal 2013 there can be no assurance however that the company’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to the company under the senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its indebtedness or to fund its other liquidity needs the company may need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness on or before maturity also to the extent the company accelerates its growth plans consummates acquisitions or has lower than anticipated sales or increases in expenses the company may also need to raise additional capital in particular 

  

increased working capital needs occur whenever the company consummates acquisitions or experiences strong incremental demand there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the company has not at this time determined to change the nature of its debt facilities however in the future the company may increase its borrowings in connection with acquisitions if cash flow from operations becomes insufficient to fund current operations or for other shortterm cash needs or for stock repurchases or dividends our future leverage will also be impacted by the then current conditions of the credit markets 

operating activities the company generated 4139 million of cash from operating activities during fiscal 2012 compared to 2604 million during fiscal 2011 the net increase of 1535 million was due primarily to an increase in income from operations partially offset by higher interest payments due the company’s current debt structure and higher income tax payments

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixedrate and floatingrate longterm debt at september 30 2012 we had borrowings under our new senior secured credit facility of 202 billion that were subject to interest rate risk borrowings under our new senior secured credit facility bear interest at our option at a rate equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted libo rate for a one two three or sixmonth or to the extent available to each lender nine or twelvemonth interest period chosen by us in each case plus an applicable margin percentage accordingly the company’s cash flows and earnings will be exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes resulting from variable rate borrowings under our new senior secured credit facility the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the annual interest costs under our new senior secured credit facility by approximately 202 million based on the amount of outstanding borrowings at september 30 2012 the weighted average interest rate on the 202 billion of borrowings under our new senior secured credit facility on september 30 2012 was 40 

at september 30 2012 three forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements were in place to swap variable rates on the new senior secured credit facility for a fixed rate based on an aggregate notional amount of 353 million beginning december 31 2012 these interest rate swap agreements will effectively convert the variable interest rate on the aggregate notional amount of the new senior secured credit facility to a fixed rate of 517 through june 30 2015 

the fair value of the 202 billion aggregate principal amount of borrowings under our new senior secured credit facility is exposed to the market risk of interest rates the estimated fair value of such term loan approximated 204 billion at september 30 2012 based upon information provided to the company from its agent under the credit facility the fair value of the 160 billion aggregate principal amount of our 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes due 2018 is exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes the estimated fair value of such notes approximated 170 billion at september 30 2012 based upon quoted market rates

 item 1 business tableend the company 

transdigm inc was formed in july 1993 in connection with the acquisition of certain businesses from imo industries inc transdigm group incorporated “td group” was formed in july 2003 to facilitate the acquisition of transdigm inc in march 2006 and may 2007 certain stockholders of td group and certain members of our management sold shares of td group common stock in underwritten public offerings td group did not offer any shares of common stock for sale in the offerings and td group did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders as a result of the initial public offering in 2006 td group’s common stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “tdg” as a result of the follow on offering in 2007 td group was no longer a “controlled company” for the purposes of the nyse listing requirements 

on december 6 2010 transdigm inc completed the acquisition of mckechnie aerospace holdings inc “mckechnie aerospace” a supplier of aerospace components assemblies and subsystems for approximately 127 billion on march 9 2011 the company completed the divestiture of the fastener business acquired as part of mckechnie aerospace for approximately 2396 million subject to adjustment on april 7 2011 the company completed the divestiture of aero quality sales a distributor and service center of aircraft batteries and battery support equipment for approximately 318 million neither the nonproprietary fastener business nor the aero quality sales distribution business fit with transdigm’s overall business direction 

we believe we are a leading global designer producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers we estimate that over 90 of our net sales for fiscal year 2011 were generated by proprietary products in addition for fiscal year 2011 we estimate that we generated approximately 75 of our net sales from products for which we are the sole source provider 

  

most of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue once our parts are designed into and sold on a new aircraft we generate net sales from aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft which is generally estimated to be approximately 30 years a typical platform can be produced for 20 to 30 years giving us an estimated product life cycle of 5060 years we estimate that approximately 56 of our net sales in fiscal year 2011 were generated from aftermarket sales the vast majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets these aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and been more stable than sales to original equipment manufacturers or oems 

products 

we primarily design produce and supply highlyengineered proprietary aerospace components and certain systemssubsystems with significant aftermarket content we seek to develop highly customized products to solve specific needs for aircraft operators and manufacturers we attempt to differentiate ourselves based on engineering service and manufacturing capabilities we typically choose not to compete for nonproprietary “build to print” business because it frequently offers lower margins than proprietary products we believe that our products have strong brand names within the industry and that we have a reputation for high quality reliability and customer support 

our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products that we offer to our customers some of our more significant product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and engine technology specialized pumps and valves power conditioning devices specialized acdc electric motors and generators nicad batteries and chargers engineered latching and locking devices rods and locking devices engineered connectors and elastomers cockpit security components and systems specialized cockpit displays aircraft audio systems specialized lavatory components engineered interior surfaces and lighting and control technology 

sales and marketing 

consistent with our overall strategy our sales and marketing organization is structured to continually develop technical solutions that meet customer needs in particular we attempt to focus on products and programs that will lead to highmargin repeatable sales in the aftermarket 

we have structured our sales efforts along our major product offerings assigning a product manager to certain products each product manager is expected to grow the sales and profitability of the products for which he or she is responsible and to achieve the targeted annual level of bookings sales new business and profitability for such products the product managers are assisted by account managers and sales engineers who are responsible for covering major oem and aftermarket accounts account managers and sales engineers are expected to be familiar with the personnel organization and needs of specific customers to achieve total bookings and new business goals at each account and together with the product managers to determine when additional resources are required at customer locations most of our sales personnel are evaluated in part on their bookings and their ability to identify and obtain new business opportunities 

though typically performed by employees the account manager function may be performed by independent representatives depending on the specific customer product and geographic location we also use a number of distributors to provide logistical support as well as primary customer contact with certain smaller accounts our major distributors are aviall inc a subsidiary of the boeing company and satair as a danish public company on whose board of directors mr howley our chairman and chief executive officer served through october 2011 

manufacturing and engineering 

we maintain 25 principal manufacturing facilities our manufacturing facilities typically comprise manufacturing distribution and engineering functions and most facilities have certain administrative functions 

  

including management sales and finance we continually strive to improve productivity and reduce costs including rationalization of operations developing improved control systems that allow for accurate product profit and loss accounting investing in equipment tooling information systems and implementing broadbased employee training programs management believes that our manufacturing systems and equipment contribute to our ability to compete by permitting us to meet the rigorous tolerances and cost sensitive price structure of aircraft component customers 

we attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by producing uniquely engineered products with high quality and timely delivery our engineering costs are recorded in cost of sales and in selling and administrative captions in our consolidated statements of income total engineering expense represents approximately 7 of our operating units’ aggregate costs or approximately 4 of our consolidated net sales our proprietary products and particularly our new product initiatives are designed by our engineers and are intended to serve the needs of the aircraft component industry these proprietary designs must withstand the extraordinary conditions and stresses that will be endured by products during use and meet the rigorous demands of our customers’ tolerance and quality requirements 

we use sophisticated equipment and procedures to comply with quality requirements specifications and federal aviation administration the “faa” and oem requirements we perform a variety of testing procedures including testing under different temperature humidity and altitude levels shock and vibration testing and xray fluorescent measurement these procedures together with other customer approved techniques for document process and quality control are used throughout our manufacturing facilities 

customers 

our customers include 1 distributors of aerospace components 2 worldwide commercial airlines including national and regional airlines 3 large commercial transport and regional and business aircraft oems 4 various armed forces of the united states and friendly foreign governments 5 defense oems 6 system suppliers and 7 various other industrial customers for the year ended september 30 2011 boeing which includes aviall inc a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world accounted for approximately 14 of our net sales our top ten customers for fiscal year 2011 accounted for approximately 43 of our net sales products supplied to many of our customers are used on multiple platforms 

active commercial production programs include the boeing 737 747 767 777 and 787 the airbus a3192021 a330a340 and a380 the bombardier crj’s and challenger the embraer rj’s the cessna citation family the raytheon premier and hawker and most gulfstream airframes military platforms include aircraft such as the boeing c17 f15 f18 and v22 the lockheed martin c130j f16 and f35 joint strikefighter the northrop grumman e2c hawkeye the uh60 blackhawk ch47 chinook and ah64 apache helicopters the general atomics predator drone and the raytheon patriot missile transdigm has been awarded numerous contracts for the development of engineered products for production on the airbus a350xwb a320 neo and a400m programs and the bombardier learjet 85 

we believe that we have strong customer relationships with almost all large commercial transport regional general aviation and military oems the demand for our aftermarket parts and services depends on among other things the breadth of our installed oem base revenue passenger miles “rpms” the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and to a lesser extent airline profitability we believe that we are also a leading supplier of components used on us designed military aircraft including components that are used on a variety of fighter aircraft military freighters and military helicopters 

competition 

the niche markets within the aerospace industry that we serve are relatively fragmented and we face several competitors for many of the products and services we provide due to the global nature of the commercial aircraft industry competition in these categories comes from both us and foreign companies competitors in our product offerings range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privatelyheld entities with only one or two components in their entire product portfolios 

  

we compete on the basis of engineering manufacturing and marketing high quality products which we believe meet or exceed the performance and maintenance requirements of our customers consistent and timely delivery and superior customer service and support the industry’s stringent regulatory certification and technical requirements and the investments necessary in the development and certification of products create barriers to entry for potential new competitors as long as customers receive products that meet or exceed expectations and performance standards we believe that they will have a reduced incentive to certify another supplier because of the cost and time of the technical design and testing certification process in addition we believe that concerns about safety and flight delays if products are unavailable or undependable are reasons for our customers to continue longterm supplier relationships 

government contracts 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 1 suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations 2 terminate existing contracts 3 reduce the value of existing contracts 4 audit our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs and 5 control and potentially prohibit the export of our products 

governmental regulation 

the commercial aircraft component industry is highly regulated by both the faa in the united states and by the joint aviation authorities in europe and other agencies throughout the world while the military aircraft component industry is governed by military quality specifications we and the components we manufacture are required to be certified by one or more of these entities or agencies and in many cases by individual oems in order to engineer and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models 

we must also satisfy the requirements of our customers including oems and airlines that are subject to faa regulations and provide these customers with products and services that comply with the government regulations applicable to commercial flight operations in addition the faa requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components we believe that we currently satisfy or exceed these maintenance standards in our repair and overhaul services we also maintain several faa approved repair stations 

in addition sales of many of our products that will be used on aircraft owned by nonus entities are subject to compliance with us export control laws 

our operations are also subject to a variety of worker and community safety laws the occupational safety and health act “osha” mandates general requirements for safe workplaces for all employees in addition osha provides special procedures and measures for the handling of certain hazardous and toxic substances 

raw materials 

we require the use of various raw materials in our manufacturing processes we also purchase a variety of manufactured component parts from various suppliers at times we concentrate our orders among a few suppliers in order to strengthen our supplier relationships raw materials and component parts are generally available from multiple suppliers at competitive prices 

intellectual property 

we have various trade secrets proprietary information trademarks trade names patents copyrights and other intellectual property rights which we believe in the aggregate but not individually are important to our business 

  

backlog 

as of september 30 2011 the company estimated its sales order backlog at 737 million compared to an estimated sales order backlog of 467 million as of september 30 2010 the increase in backlog is primarily due to the acquisitions of mckechnie aerospace talley actuation and schneller holdings discussed below totaling approximately 207 million as of september 30 2011 the majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of september 30 2011 are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months purchase orders may be subject to cancellation or deferral by the customer prior to shipment the level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of the company’s receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled accordingly the company’s backlog as of september 30 2011 may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period 

foreign operations 

although we manufacture substantially all of our products in the united states we manufacture some products in belgium malaysia and mexico we sell our products in the united states as well as in foreign countries a number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including currency fluctuations difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies restrictions on the repatriation of funds change in trade policies tariff regulation difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition 

our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately 3055 million 1706 million and 1504 million for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks including the impact of foreign government regulations political uncertainties and differences in business practices there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments’ countries furthermore there can be no assurance that the political cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy

our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things discharges of pollutants into the air and water the generation handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees environmental laws and regulations may require that the company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations at certain facilities acquired in connection with the acquisition of mckechnie aerospace or thirdparty sites utilized by subsidiaries of mckechnie aerospace subsidiaries of the company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws the company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws 

estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are based on current facts laws regulations and technology these estimates take into consideration the company’s prior experience and professional judgment of the company’s environmental specialists estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination the range of remediation alternatives available evolving remediation standards imprecise engineering evaluations and cost estimates the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 

accordingly as investigation and remediation proceed it is likely that adjustments in the company’s accruals will be necessary to reflect new information the amounts of any such adjustments could have a 

  

material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in a given period based on currently available information however the company does not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition 

environmental liabilities are recorded when the liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable which generally is not later than at completion of a feasibility study or when the company has recommended a remedy or has committed to an appropriate plan of action the liabilities are reviewed periodically and as investigation and remediation proceed adjustments are made as necessary liabilities for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not consider the effects of inflation and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value the liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties but do reflect anticipated allocations among potentially responsible parties at federal superfund sites or similar statemanaged sites third party indemnity obligations and an assessment of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their obligations at such sites 

employees 

as of september 30 2011 we had approximately 3800 full time part time and temporary employees approximately 16 of our employees were represented by labor unions collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire at various dates ranging from february 2012 to april 2014 we consider our relationship with our employees generally to be satisfactory 

legal proceedings 

we are from time to time subject to and are presently involved in litigation or other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business based upon information currently known to us we believe the outcome of such proceedings will not have individually or in the aggregate a material adverse effect on our business our financial condition or results of operations

 item 1a risk factors tableend set forth below are important risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business and financial condition and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

our business is sensitive to the number of flight hours that our customers’ planes spend aloft the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and our customers’ profitability these items are in turn affected by general economic conditions 

our business is directly affected by among other factors changes in revenue passenger miles rpms the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and to a lesser extent changes in the profitability of the commercial airline industry rpms and airline profitability have historically been correlated with the general economic environment although national and international events also play a key role for example in the past decade the airline industry has been severely affected by the downturn in the global economy higher fuel prices the increased security concerns among airline customers following the events of september 11 2001 the severe 

  

acute respiratory syndrome or sars epidemic and the conflicts in afghanistan and iraq in addition global market and economic conditions have been challenging with continued turbulence in the us and international markets and economies and have prolonged declines in business and consumer spending as a result of the substantial reduction in airline traffic resulting from these events the airline industry incurred large losses and financial difficulties some carriers have also parked or retired a portion of their fleets and have reduced workforces and flights during periods of reduced airline profitability some airlines may delay purchases of spare parts preferring instead to deplete existing inventories if demand for new aircraft and spare parts decreases there would be a decrease in demand for certain of our products 

our sales to manufacturers of aircraft are cyclical and a downturn in sales to these manufacturers may adversely affect us 

our sales to manufacturers of large commercial aircraft such as the boeing company airbus sas and related oem suppliers as well as manufacturers of business jets which accounted for approximately 25 of our net sales in fiscal year 2011 have historically experienced periodic downturns in the past these sales have been affected by airline profitability which is impacted by among other things fuel and labor costs price competition downturns in the global economy and national and international events such as the events of september 11 2001 in addition sales of our products to manufacturers of business jets are impacted by among other things downturns in the global economy prior downturns have adversely affected our net sales gross margin and net income 

we rely heavily on certain customers for much of our sales 

our largest customer for fiscal year 2011 was the boeing company which includes aviall inc a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world boeing accounted for approximately 14 of our net sales in fiscal year 2011 our top ten customers for fiscal year 2011 accounted for approximately 43 of our net sales a reduction in purchasing by one of our larger customers for any reason such as economic downturn decreased production or strike could have a material adverse effect on our net sales gross margin and net income 

we generally do not have guaranteed future sales of our products further when we enter into fixed price contracts with some of our customers we take the risk for cost overruns 

as is customary in our business we do not generally have longterm contracts with most of our aftermarket customers and therefore do not have guaranteed future sales although we have longterm contracts with many of our oem customers many of those customers may terminate the contracts on short notice and in most cases our customers have not committed to buy any minimum quantity of our products in addition in certain cases we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon the historic purchasing patterns of customers and upon our discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements and this anticipated future volume of orders may not materialize 

we also have entered into multiyear fixedprice contracts with some of our customers pursuant to which we have agreed to perform the work for a fixed price and accordingly realize all the benefit or detriment resulting from any decreases or increases in the costs of making these products sometimes we accept a fixedprice contract for a product that we have not yet produced and this increases the risk of cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product most of our contracts do not permit us to recover increases in raw material prices taxes or labor costs 

us military spending is dependent upon the us defense budget 

the military and defense market is significantly dependent upon government budget trends particularly the us department of defense the “dod” budget in addition to normal business risks our supply of products to 

  

the united states government is subject to unique risks largely beyond our control future dod budgets could be negatively impacted by several factors including but not limited to a change in defense spending policy by the current presidential administration the us government’s budget deficits spending priorities the cost of sustaining the us military presence in iraq and afghanistan and possible political pressure to reduce us government military spending each of which could cause the dod budget to remain unchanged or to decline a significant decline in us military expenditures in the future could result in a reduction in the amount of our products sold to the various agencies and buying organizations of the us government 

we intend to pursue future acquisitions our business may be adversely affected if we cannot consummate acquisitions on satisfactory terms or if we cannot effectively integrate acquired operations 

a significant portion of our growth has occurred through acquisitions any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions we intend to pursue acquisitions that we believe will present opportunities consistent with our overall business strategy however we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates to purchase or may be unable to acquire desired businesses or assets on economically acceptable terms in addition we may not be able to raise the capital necessary to fund future acquisitions because we may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously we may encounter unforeseen expenses complications and delays including difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight 

we regularly engage in discussions with respect to potential acquisition and investment opportunities if we consummate an acquisition our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly future acquisitions could likely result in the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest and amortization expenses or periodic impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets as well as significant charges relating to integration costs 

acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect in addition we may not be able to successfully integrate any business we acquire into our existing business the successful integration of new businesses depends on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs the successful integration of future acquisitions may also require substantial attention from our senior management and the management of the acquired business which could decrease the time that they have to service attract customers and develop new products and services or attend to other acquisition opportunities 

we are subject to certain unique business risks as a result of supplying equipment and services to the us government 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 

 

  

  

  

 most of our us government contracts can be terminated by the us government for its convenience without significant notice termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination 

  

on contracts for which the price is based on cost the us government may review our costs and performance as well as our accounting and general business practices based on the results of such audits the us government may adjust our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs in addition under us government purchasing regulations some of our costs including most financing costs amortization of intangible assets portions of research and development costs and certain marketing expenses may not be subject to reimbursement 

in addition even where the price is not based on cost the us government may seek to review our costs to determine whether our pricing is “fair and reasonable” five of our subsidiaries and divisions were subject to such a pricing review for years 2002 through 2004 and it is possible that we will be subject to a similar pricing review in the future such a review could be costly and time consuming for our management and could distract from our ability to effectively manage the business as a result of such a review we could be subject to providing a refund to the us government or we could be asked to enter into an arrangement whereby our prices would be based on cost or the dod could seek to pursue alternative sources of supply for our parts any of those occurrences could lead to a reduction in our revenue from or the profitability of certain of our supply arrangements with certain agencies and buying organizations of the us government 

our business may be adversely affected if we would lose our government or industry approvals or if more stringent government regulations are enacted or if industry oversight is increased 

the aerospace industry is highly regulated in the united states and in other countries in order to sell our components we and the components we manufacture must be certified by the faa the dod and similar agencies in foreign countries and by individual manufacturers if new and more stringent government regulations are adopted or if industry oversight increases we might incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or heightened industry oversight in addition if material authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended our business would be adversely affected 

in addition to the aviation approvals we are at times required to obtain approval from us government agencies to export our products additionally we are not permitted to export some of our products a determination by the us government that we failed to receive required approvals or licenses could eliminate or restrict our ability to sell our products outside the united states and the penalties that could be imposed by the us government for failure to comply with these laws could be significant 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and could harm our ability to react to changes to our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of september 30 2011 our total indebtedness was approximately 31384 million which was approximately 795 of our total capitalization 

in addition we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future for example as of september 30 2011 we had approximately 2370 million of unused commitments under our revolving loan facility although our senior secured credit facility and the indentures the “indentures” governing the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes issued in december 2010 the “7 3  4  senior subordinated notes” contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these qualifications and exceptions could be substantial if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage would increase 

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to investors for example it could 

 

  

   

  

  

 in addition all of our debt under the senior secured credit facility which includes a 155 billion term loan facility and a revolving loan facility of 245 million bears interest at floating rates accordingly in the event that interest rates increase our debt service expense will also increase in order to reduce the floating interest rate risk as of september 30 2011 the company was party to three forward starting interest rate swap agreements that fix the rate of interest beginning december 31 2012 through june 30 2015 on an aggregate notional amount of 353 million of debt under the senior secured credit facility 

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness including the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital 

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make payments on our indebtedness including the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes and amounts borrowed under the credit facilities and to fund our operations will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future which to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot assure you however that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness including the amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility and the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes or to fund our other liquidity needs if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital we cannot assure you that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations the terms of existing or future debt instruments the indentures and the senior secured credit facility may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives in addition any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms and would otherwise adversely affect the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes 

the terms of the senior secured credit facility and indentures may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

our senior secured credit facility and the indentures contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of 

  

the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indentures and may limit their ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests the senior secured credit facility and indentures include covenants restricting among other things the ability of td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indentures to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the indentures if any such default occurs the lenders under the senior secured credit facility and the holders of the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder to be immediately due and payable the lenders under the senior secured credit facility also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings in addition following an event of default under the senior secured credit facility the lenders under that facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which includes our available cash and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes if the debt under the senior secured credit facility or the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations 

our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things discharges of pollutants into the air and water the generation handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees environmental laws and regulations may require that the company investigate and remediate the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with past and present operations at certain facilities acquired in connection with the acquisition of mckechnie aerospace or thirdparty sites utilized by subsidiaries of mckechnie aerospace subsidiaries of the company have been identified as potentially responsible parties under the federal superfund laws and comparable state laws the company is currently involved in the investigation and remediation of a number of sites under applicable laws 

estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are based on current facts laws regulations and technology these estimates take into consideration the company’s prior experience and professional judgment of the company’s environmental specialists estimates of the company’s environmental liabilities are further subject to uncertainties regarding the nature and extent of site contamination the range of remediation alternatives available evolving remediation standards imprecise engineering evaluations and cost estimates the extent of corrective actions that may be required and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties as well as the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 

  

accordingly as investigation and remediation proceed it is likely that adjustments in the company’s accruals will be necessary to reflect new information the amounts of any such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in a given period based on currently available information however the company does not believe that future environmental costs in excess of those accrued with respect to sites for which the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition 

environmental liabilities are recorded when the liability is probable and the costs are reasonably estimable which generally is not later than at completion of a feasibility study or when the company has recommended a remedy or has committed to an appropriate plan of action the liabilities are reviewed periodically and as investigation and remediation proceed adjustments are made as necessary liabilities for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not consider the effects of inflation and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value the liabilities are not reduced by possible recoveries from insurance carriers or other third parties but do reflect anticipated allocations among potentially responsible parties at federal superfund sites or similar statemanaged sites third party indemnity obligations and an assessment of the likelihood that such parties will fulfill their obligations at such sites 

we are dependent on our highly trained employees and any work stoppage or difficulty hiring similar employees could adversely affect our business 

because our products are complicated and highly engineered we depend on an educated and trained workforce there is substantial competition for skilled personnel in the aircraft component industry and we could be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled employees we may not be able to fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover or attract and retain qualified personnel 

as of september 30 2011 we had approximately 3800 full time part time and temporary employees approximately 16 of our employees were represented by labor unions collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire at various dates ranging from february 2012 to april 2014 we consider our relationship with our employees generally to be satisfactory although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory we cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory renewal of these collective bargaining agreements or that our employee relations will remain stable because we maintain a relatively small inventory of finished goods any work stoppage could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide products to our customers 

our business is dependent on the availability of certain components and raw materials from suppliers 

our business is affected by the price and availability of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our components our business therefore could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our suppliers such as the destruction of our suppliers’ facilities or their distribution infrastructure a work stoppage or strike by our suppliers’ employees or the failure of our suppliers to provide materials of the requisite quality or by increased costs of such raw materials or components if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers because we maintain a relatively small inventory of raw materials and component parts our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers or alternative raw materials or component parts the lengthy and expensive faa and oem certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier raw material or component part 

our facilities are located near known earthquake fault zones and the occurrence of an earthquake or other natural disaster could cause damage to our facilities and equipment which could require us to curtail or cease operations 

six of our manufacturing facilities are located in the greater los angeles area an area known for earthquakes and are thus vulnerable to damage we are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters 

  

including power loss fire explosions floods communications failures terrorist attacks and similar events if any disaster were to occur our ability to operate our business at our facilities could be impaired 

we have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets which may never generate the returns we expect 

mergers and acquisitions have resulted in significant increases in identifiable intangible assets and goodwill identifiable intangible assets which primarily include trademarks trade names trade secrets license agreements and technology were approximately 8284 million at september 30 2011 representing approximately 18 of our total assets goodwill recognized in accounting for the mergers and acquisitions was approximately 25957 million at september 30 2011 representing approximately 58 of our total assets we may never realize the full value of our identifiable intangible assets and goodwill and to the extent we were to determine that our identifiable intangible assets or our goodwill were impaired within the meaning of applicable accounting standards we would be required to writeoff the amount of any impairment 

we face significant competition 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry and compete against a number of companies competitors in our product lines are both us and foreign companies and range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privately held entities we believe that our ability to compete depends on high product performance consistent high quality short leadtime and timely delivery competitive pricing superior customer service and support and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs we may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive 

we could be adversely affected if one of our components causes an aircraft to crash 

our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we have designed manufactured or serviced while we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future products liability claims in the event of product liability claims our insurers may attempt to deny coverage or any coverage we have may not be adequate we also may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost any liability not covered by insurance or for which third party indemnification is not available could result in significant liability to us 

in addition a crash caused by one of our components could damage our reputation for quality products we believe our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting a provider of aircraft components if a crash were to be caused by one of our components or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected 

our stock price may be volatile and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 

there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities which is unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities these broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the purchase price due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects including possible changes due to the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry and other factors such as fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering which could cause shortterm swings in profit margins or unrelated to our operating performance including market conditions affecting the stock market generally or the stocks of aerospace companies more specifically 

  

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our share price 

we may sell additional shares of common stock into the public markets or issue convertible debt securities to raise capital in the future the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public markets or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities to raise capital at a time and price that we deem appropriate 

our corporate documents and delaware law contain certain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable for example our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 149600000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock without stockholder approval the board of directors has the authority to attach special rights including voting and dividend rights to this preferred stock with these rights holders of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us in addition our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered board of directors whereby directors serve for threeyear terms with approximately onethird of the directors coming up for reelection each year having a staggered board will make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of our board of directors through a proxy contest which may be a necessary step in an acquisition of us that is not favored by our board of directors our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75 of the voting power of our issued and outstanding capital stock voting together as a single class is required for the alteration amendment or repeal of certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation including the provisions authorizing a staggered board and certain provisions of our amended and restated bylaws including the provisions relating to our stockholders’ ability to call special meetings notice provisions for stockholder business to be conducted at an annual meeting requests for stockholder lists and corporate records nomination and removal of directors and filling of vacancies on our board of directors 

we are also subject to the antitakeover provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law under these provisions if anyone becomes an “interested stockholder” we may not enter into a “business combination” with that person for three years without special approval which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change of control for purposes of section 203 “interested stockholder” means generally someone owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years subject to certain exceptions as described in section 203 

we do not intend to pay regular cash dividends on our stock 

notwithstanding the special cash dividend paid in october 2009 we do not anticipate declaring or paying regular cash dividends on our common stock or any other equity security in the foreseeable future the amounts that may be available to us to pay cash dividends are restricted under our debt and other agreements any payment of cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations earnings capital requirements financial condition future prospects contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors therefore you should not rely on dividend income from shares of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected financial data” and td group’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report the following discussion may contain predictions estimates and other forwardlooking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties including those discussed under the heading entitled “risk factors” included elsewhere in this report these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 

overview 

we believe we are a leading global designer producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers some of our more significant product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and engine technology specialized pumps and valves power conditioning devices specialized acdc electric motors and generators nicad batteries and chargers engineered latching and locking devices rods and locking devices engineered connectors and elastomers cockpit security components and systems specialized cockpit displays aircraft audio systems specialized lavatory components engineered interior surfaces and lighting and control technology each of these product offerings is composed of many individual products that are typically customized to meet the needs of a particular aircraft platform or customer 

longterm sustainable growth 

for fiscal year 2011 we generated net sales of 12060 million gross profit of 6612 million or 548 of sales and net income of 1721 million we believe we have achieved steady longterm growth in sales and improvements in operating performance since our formation in 1993 due to our competitive strengths and through execution of our valuedriven operating strategy more specifically focusing our businesses on our valuedriven operating strategy of obtaining profitable new business carefully controlling the cost structure and pricing our highly engineered valueadded products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so has historically resulted in improvements in gross profit and income from operations over the long term 

our selective acquisition strategy has also contributed to the growth of our business the integration of certain acquisitions into our existing businesses combined with implementing our proven operating strategy has historically resulted in improvements of the financial performance of the acquired business 

our key competitive strengths and the elements of our business strategy are set forth in more detail below 

we believe our key competitive strengths include 

large and growing installed product base with aftermarket revenue stream we provide components to a large and growing installed base of aircraft to which we supply aftermarket products we estimate that our products are installed on approximately 70000 commercial transport regional transport military and general aviation fixed wing turbine aircraft and rotary wing aircraft 

diversified revenue base we believe that our diversified revenue base reduces our dependence on any particular product platform or market channel and has been a significant factor in maintaining our financial performance our products are installed on almost all of the major commercial aircraft platforms now in production we expect to continue to develop new products for military and commercial applications 

  

significant barriers to entry  we believe that the niche nature of our markets the industry’s stringent regulatory and certification requirements the large number of products that we sell and the investments necessary to develop and certify products create barriers to entry for potential competitors 

our business strategy is made up of two key elements 1 a valuedriven operating strategy focused around our three core value drivers and 2 a selective acquisition strategy 

valuedriven operating strategy our three core value drivers are 

 

  

  

 selective acquisition strategy we selectively pursue the acquisition of proprietary aerospace component businesses when we see an opportunity to create value through the application of our three core valuedriven operating strategies the aerospace industry in particular remains highly fragmented with many of the companies in the industry being small private businesses or small noncore operations of larger businesses we have significant experience among our management team in executing acquisitions and integrating acquired businesses into our company and culture as of the date of this report we have successfully acquired and integrated 34 businesses andor product lines since our formation in 1993 many of these acquisitions have been integrated into an existing transdigm production facility which enables a higher production capacity utilization which in turn improves gross profit levels due to the ability to spread the fixed manufacturing overhead costs over higher production volume 

public offerings 

on march 20 2006 and may 25 2007 certain stockholders of td group including certain members of our management sold an aggregate of 115 million and 126 million shares of td group’s common stock respectively in public offerings at prices of 2100 and 3525 per share td group did not offer any shares of its common stock for sale in the public offerings and td group did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of such shares by the selling stockholders as a result of the initial public offering td group’s common stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “tdg”

       the following table sets forth a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to ebitda and ebitda as defined 

 

  

     

      trend information 

we predominantly serve customers in the commercial regional business jet and general aviation aftermarket which accounts for approximately 40 of total sales the commercial aerospace oem market comprising large commercial transport manufacturers and regional and business jet manufacturers which accounts for approximately 28 of total sales and the defense market which accounts for approximately 29 of total sales nonaerospace sales comprise approximately 3 of our total sales 

the commercial aerospace industry including the aftermarket and oem market is impacted by the health of the global economy and geopolitical events around the world the commercial aerospace industry had shown strength with increases in revenue passenger miles or rpms between 2003 and 2008 as well as increases in oem production and backlog however in 2009 the global economic downturn negatively impacted the commercial aerospace industry causing rpms to decline slightly this market sector began to rebound in 2010 and continued to grow in 2011 with increases in rpms as well as the growth in the large commercial oem sector aircraft with 100 or more seats with order announcements by the boeing company and airbus sas leading to planned increases in production the 2012 leading indicators and industry consensus suggest the continuation of current trends in the commercial transport market sector supported by continued rpm growth a modest acceleration of capacity growth and increases in production at the oem level 

the defense aerospace market is dependent on government budget constraints the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts it is not necessarily affected by general economic conditions that affect the commercial aerospace industry 

our presence in both the commercial aerospace and military sectors of the aerospace industry may mitigate the impact on our business of any specific industry risk we service a diversified customer base in the commercial and military aerospace industry and we provide components to a diverse installed base of aircraft which mitigates our exposure to any individual airframe platform at times declines in sales in one channel have been offset by increased sales in another however due to differences between the profitability of our products sold to oem and aftermarket customers variation in product mix can cause variation in gross margin 

there are many shortterm factors including inventory corrections unannounced changes in order patterns strikes and mergers and acquisitions that can cause shortterm disruptions in our quarterly shipment patterns as compared to previous quarters and the same periods in prior years to normalize for shortterm fluctuations we tend to look at our performance over several quarters or years of activity rather than discrete shortterm periods as such it can be difficult to determine longerterm trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons 

there are also fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering and delivery requests from quartertoquarter as well as variations in product mix from quartertoquarter that may cause positive or negative variations in 

  

gross profit margins since commercial aftermarket sales have historically produced a higher gross margin than sales to commercial oems again in many instances these are timing events between quarters and must be balanced with macro aerospace industry indicators 

commercial aftermarket 

the key growth factors in the commercial aftermarket include worldwide rpms and the size and activity level of the worldwide fleet of aircraft although rpms increased annually between 2003 and 2008 2009 had negative growth as a result of reductions in air traffic and capacity due to the slowdown in the global economy worldwide rpms returned to positive growth in 2010 and 2011 and current industry consensus indicates that rpm growth will continue in 2012 

commercial oem market 

conditions in the commercial transport market sector improved during 2011 we are now expecting increased sales in the large commercial oem sector aircraft with 100 or more seats driven by order announcements by the boeing company and airbus sas furthermore the business jet oem market significantly declined between 2008 and 2010 however the business jet oem market has started to recover in 2011 and is expected to continue to show positive growth in 2012 this market has been negatively impacted by the slowdown in economic growth corporate profits commodity prices and stock market returns across the world 

defense 

in recent years defense spending has reached historic highs due in part to the military engagements in afghanistan and iraq and the war on terrorism our military business fluctuates from year to year and is dependent to a degree on government budget constraints the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts we anticipate that military related sales of our types of products could be flat to modestly down in future years over the current high levels 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations however investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 

we have identified the following as the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial status depends these critical policies were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments our most critical accounting policies are as follows 

revenue recognition and related allowances  revenue is recognized from the sale of products when title and risk of loss passes to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment substantially all sales are made pursuant to firm fixedprice purchase orders received from customers collectability of amounts recorded as revenue is reasonably assured at the time of sale provisions for returns uncollectible accounts and the cost of repairs under contract warranty provisions are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are principally based on historical results modified as appropriate by the most current information available we have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of such allowances however due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process it is possible that actual results may vary from the estimates and the differences could be material 

  

management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable and customer creditworthiness the allowance also incorporates a provision for the estimated impact of disputes with customers management’s estimate of the allowance amounts that are necessary includes amounts for specifically identified credit losses and a general amount for estimated credit losses based on historical information the determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to significant levels of judgment and estimation by management depending on the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues or if the financial condition of any of the company’s customers were to deteriorate and their ability to make required payments were to become impaired increases in these allowances may be required historically changes in estimates in the allowance for doubtful accounts have not been significant 

the company provides limited warranties in connection with the sale of its products the warranty period for products sold which varies among the company’s operations is typically less than two years but can be in the range from 90 days to six years in addition certain contracts with distributors contain right of return provisions the company accrues for estimated returns and warranty claims based on knowledge of product performance issues and based on excess inventories provided by its customers and industry sources the company also provides a general amount based on historical trends to the extent total warranty claims differ from estimates adjustments may be necessary historically actual product returns and warranty claims have not differed materially from the estimates originally established 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost of inventories is determined by the average cost and the firstin firstout fifo methods for all locations except cef industries llc which determines the cost of inventories using the lastin firstout lifo method because the company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be inservice for 30 or more years it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use where management estimated that the current market value was below cost or determined that future demand was lower than current inventory levels based on historical experience current and projected market demand current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value was made by recording a provision included in cost of sales although management believes that the company’s estimates of excess and obsolete inventory are reasonable actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future in addition in accordance with industry practice all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year historically changes in estimates in the net realizable value of inventories have not been significant 

intangible assets  mergers and acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method and have resulted in significant amounts of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill fair value adjustments to the company’s assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition we generally use thirdparty appraisals to assist us in determining the estimated fair value of the intangible assets 

intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights or if the intangible asset can be sold transferred licensed or exchanged regardless of the company’s intent to do so goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition and are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates 

gaap requires that the annual and any interim impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level the reporting unit level is the operating subsidiary level for the company substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each operating subsidiary pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction and therefore the allocation of goodwill among reporting units was immaterial for purposes of the impairment assessment with respect to acquisitions integrated into an existing operating subsidiary any related goodwill is combined with goodwill of the operating subsidiary 

  

at the time of goodwill impairment testing management determines the estimated fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit if the calculated estimated fair value is less than the current carrying value impairment of goodwill of the reporting unit may exist the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing includes discount rates growth rates cash flow projections and terminal value rates discount rates are set by using the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” methodology the wacc methodology considers market and industry data as well as company specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business 

operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates as an indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately through the use of the discounted cash flow valuation model the aggregate of all reporting units estimated fair value is reconciled to the total market capitalization of the company 

the company had 17 reporting units with goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 the date of the last annual impairment test the estimated fair values of each of the reporting units was substantially in excess of their respective carrying values by more than 15 percent and therefore no goodwill impairment was recorded the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate which is a significant assumption in the calculation of fair values with a one percentage point increase in the discount rate the reporting units would continue to have fair values in excess of their respective carrying values 

management tests indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at the asset level as determined by appropriate asset valuation at the time of acquisition the impairment test for indefinitelived intangible assets consists of a comparison between the estimated fair values and carrying values if the carrying amounts of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives exceed their estimated fair values an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference management utilizes the royalty savings valuation method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinitelived intangible asset in this method management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset the key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates royalty rates growth rates sales projections and terminal value rates discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the wacc methodology considering any differences in companyspecific risk factors between reporting units and the indefinitelived intangible assets royalty rates are established by management with the advice of valuation experts and periodically substantiated by valuation experts operational management considering industry and companyspecific historical and projected data develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant intangible asset terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low longterm growth rates 

the discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed actual results could differ from these assumptions management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering the current economic conditions 

stock options  the company accounts for the cost of its stock options in accordance with gaap which requires the measurement of compensation expense under the stock option plan to be based on the estimated fair value of the awards under the plan on the grant dates and amortizes the expense over the vesting periods of the options the company estimates the fair value of all sharebased payments using the blackscholesmerton option pricing model which requires management to make certain assumptions management continuously reviews the 

  

following assumptions riskfree interest rates expected life of options expected volatility of stock and expected dividend yield of stock an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside management’s control could have an impact on the company’s results of operations 

environmental matters  the company is involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of its currently and formerly owned sites and at thirdparty sites the company accrues for environmentalrelated activities for which commitments or cleanup plans have been developed and for which costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment all accrued amounts were recorded on an undiscounted basis environmentalrelated expenses include costs of investigation and remediation and fees paid to outside engineering actuarial consulting and law firms due to uncertainties surrounding environmental investigations and remediation activities the company’s ultimate liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued 

income taxes  the company estimates income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates this involves estimating taxable earnings specific taxable and deductible items the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits to the extent these estimates change adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes are made in the period in which the changes occur historically such adjustments have not been significant 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain operating data of the company including presentation of the amounts as a percentage of net sales amounts in thousands 

 

 fiscal year ended september 30 2011 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2010 

net sales  net sales increased by 3784 million or 457 to 12060 million for fiscal 2011 from 8277 million for fiscal 2010 sales of 2762 million or 334 resulted from the acquisitions of dukes aerospace and semco instruments in fiscal 2010 and mckechnie aerospace talley actuation and schneller holdings in fiscal 2011 organic sales increased by 1022 million or 123 from the prior year 

the organic sales growth was primarily due to an increase of 222 million or a 120 increase in commercial oem sales and an increase of 737 million or a 221 increase in commercial aftermarket sales resulting primarily from improving market demand for commercial aftermarket products defense sales increased by 16 million for fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

  

cost of sales and gross profit cost of sales increased by 1902 million or 537 to 5448 million for fiscal 2011 from 3546 million for fiscal 2010 the increase in the dollar amount of cost of sales was primarily due to increased volume associated with the net sales from acquisitions and the organic sales growth discussed above along with an increase in inventory purchase accounting adjustments and acquisition integration costs 

gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 548 for fiscal 2011 from 572 for fiscal 2010 the dollar amount of gross profit increased by 1881 million or 398 to 6612 million for fiscal 2011 from 4731 million for fiscal 2010 the increase in the amount of gross profit was primarily due to the following items 

 

  

 selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased by 388 million to 1337 million or 111 of sales for fiscal 2011 from 949 million or 115 of sales for the fiscal 2010 the increase is primarily due to higher selling and administrative expenses relating to recent acquisitions of approximately 28 million and noncash stock compensation expense of approximately 5 million 

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles increased to 403 million for fiscal 2011 from 151 million for fiscal 2010 the net increase of 252 million was primarily due to amortization expense related to the additional identifiable intangible assets recognized in connection with acquisitions during the last twelve months 

refinancing costs refinancing costs were recorded as a result of the refinancing of transdigm’s entire debt structure in december 2010 the charge of 725 million consisted of the premium of 419 million paid to redeem our 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes the writeoff of debt issue costs and unamortized note premium and discount of 257 million and the settlement of the interest rate swap agreement and other expenses of 49 million 

interest expensenet interest expense increased 730 million or 651 to 1853 million for fiscal 2011 from 1122 million for fiscal 2010 the net increase in interest expensenet was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average level of outstanding borrowings which was approximately 290 billion for fiscal 2011 and approximately 178 billion for fiscal 2010 the increase in borrowings was due to the debt refinancing transactions and the acquisition financing related to mckechnie aerospace which occurred in december 2010 the weighted average interest rate on total borrowings outstanding at september 30 2011 was approximately 59 

income taxes income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately 336 for fiscal 2011 compared to 348 for fiscal 2010 the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to nonrecurring adjustments in estimated deferred state obligations and an increase in research and development tax credits 

income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations comprises the net loss from discontinued operations through the dates of sale of the fastener business and aqs of 21 million and the aftertax net gain on sales of 220 million recorded during fiscal 2011 

net income  net income increased 87 million or 53 to 1721 million for fiscal 2011 compared to net income of 1634 million for fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of the factors referred to above 

  

earnings per share the basic and diluted earnings per share were 317 for fiscal 2011 and 252 per share for fiscal 2010 for fiscal 2011 basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 280 and basic and diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were 037 net income for fiscal 2011 of 1721 million was decreased by an allocation of dividends to participating securities of 28 million resulting in net income available to shareholders of 1693 million due to the special cash dividend declared and paid during fiscal 2010 the net income for fiscal 2010 of 1634 million was reduced by an allocation of dividends to participating securities of 303 million resulting in net income applicable to common shareholders of 1331 million 

fiscal year ended september 30 2010 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2009 

net sales net sales increased by 661 million or 87 to 8277 million for fiscal 2010 from 7615 million for fiscal 2009 sales of 738 million resulted from the acquisitions of aircraft parts corporation acme and the woodward hrt product line in fiscal 2009 as well as the recent acquisitions of dukes aerospace and semco in fiscal 2010 

sales excluding acquisitions declined by 76 million or 10 from the prior year the decline in organic sales was primarily due to a decrease of 187 million or a 99 decrease in commercial oem sales resulting primarily from the business jet oem’s significant production rate reductions and related inventory reductions resulting from the impact of the global economic conditions partially offsetting the decline in organic commercial oem sales was i an increase of 62 million in commercial aftermarket sales due to the apparent beginning of a long awaited upturn in global air traffic and ii an increase of 27 million in defense sales primarily due to increased demand for oem products across most of our product lines 

cost of sales and gross profit cost of sales increased by 224 million or 67 to 3546 million for fiscal 2010 from 3322 million for fiscal 2009 the increase in the dollar amount of cost of sales was primarily due to increased volume associated with the higher net sales discussed above in addition the increase was partially attributable to higher costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses into td group’s operations and purchase accounting adjustments to inventory that were charged to cost of sales of 33 million 

gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to 572 for fiscal 2010 from 564 for fiscal 2009 the dollar amount of gross profit increased by 437 million or 102 to 4731 million for fiscal year 2010 from 4293 million for fiscal 2009 the increase in the amount of gross profit was primarily due to the following items 

 

  

 selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased by 149 million or 186 to 949 million 115 of net sales for fiscal 2010 from 800 million or 105 of net sales for fiscal 2009 this increase was primarily due to higher selling and administrative expenses relating to recent acquisitions of approximately 64 million transactionrelated expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of dukes aerospace and semco instruments of approximately 27 million higher research and development expenses primarily relating to airbus a350 and a380 platforms more than offsetting declines in expenses on the boeing 787 new business development expenses and higher professional fees 

  

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles increased to 151 million for fiscal 2010 from 139 million for fiscal 2009 the net increase of 12 million was primarily due to amortization expense related to the additional identifiable intangible assets recognized in connection with acquisitions during the last twelve months partially offset by the order backlog becoming fully amortized in fiscal 2009 relating to prior acquisitions 

income from operations operating income increased by 277 million or 82 to 3631 million for fiscal 2010 from 3354 million for fiscal 2009 primarily due to higher sales and other factors described above 

interest expensenet  interest expensenet increased 278 million or 330 to 1122 million for fiscal 2010 from 844 million for fiscal 2009 comprising an increase in interest expense of 267 million and a decrease in interest income of 11 million interest expense increased primarily due to interest expense of approximately 373 million attributable to the 425 million of 7 34 senior subordinated notes due 2014 issued in october 2009 partially offsetting the increase was lower interest rates on the company’s existing floatingrate borrowings under its senior secured credit facility the company’s weighted average level of outstanding borrowings was approximately 178 billion for fiscal 2010 and approximately 136 billion for fiscal 2009 the average interest rate on total debt was approximately 60 for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 interest income was lower primarily due to lower interest rates on our invested cash balances 

income taxes  income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately 348 for fiscal 2010 compared to 351 for fiscal 2009 the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reductions in estimated state tax obligations 

net income net income increased 05 million or 03 to 1634 million for fiscal 2010 compared to 1629 million for fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of the factors referred to above 

earnings per share the basic and diluted earnings per share calculated under the twoclass method was 252 per share for fiscal 2010 and 310 per share for fiscal 2009 due to the special cash dividend declared and paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 the net income for fiscal 2010 of 1634 million was reduced by an allocation of dividends to participating securities of 303 million approximately 057 per share resulting in a net income applicable to common stockholders of 1331 million 

backlog 

as of september 30 2011 the company estimated its sales order backlog at 737 million compared to an estimated sales order backlog of 467 million as of september 30 2010 the increase in backlog is primarily due to the acquisitions of mckechnie aerospace talley actuation and schneller holdings discussed above totaling approximately 207 million the majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of september 30 2011 are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months purchase orders may be subject to cancellation or deferral by the customer prior to shipment the level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of the company’s receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled accordingly the company’s backlog as of september 30 2011 may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period 

foreign operations 

although we manufacture substantially all of our products in the united states we manufacture some products in belgium malaysia and mexico we sell our products in the united states as well as in foreign countries a number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations including currency fluctuations difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operations general economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we operate limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies restrictions on the repatriation of funds change in trade policies tariff regulation difficulties in obtaining export and import licenses and the risk of government financed competition 

  

our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately 3055 million 1706 million and 1504 million for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks including the impact of foreign government regulations political uncertainties and differences in business practices there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments’ countries furthermore there can be no assurance that the political cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 

inflation 

many of the company’s raw materials and operating expenses are sensitive to the effects of inflation which could result in changing operating costs the effects of inflation on the company’s businesses during the fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 were not significant 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically maintained a capital structure comprising a mix of equity and debt financing we vary our leverage both to optimize our equity return and to pursue acquisitions we expect to meet our current debt obligations as they come due through internally generated funds from current levels of operations andor through refinancing in the debt or equity markets prior to the maturity dates of our debt 

we continually evaluate our debt facilities to assess whether they most efficiently and effectively meet the current and future needs of our business the company evaluates from time to time the appropriateness of its current leverage taking into consideration the company’s debt holders equity holders credit ratings acquisition opportunities and other factors the company’s debt leverage ratio which is computed as total debt divided by ebitda as defined for the applicable twelvemonth period has varied widely during the company’s history ranging from approximately 35 to 65 our debt leverage ratio for the fiscal year ended september 30 2011 was approximately 53 

the company regularly engages in discussions with respect to potential acquisitions and investments however there can be no assurance that the company will be able to consummate an agreement with respect to any future acquisition the company’s acquisition strategy may require substantial capital and no assurance can be given that the company will be able to raise any necessary funds on acceptable terms or at all if the company incurs additional debt to finance acquisitions total interest expense will increase 

if the company has excess cash it may consider methods by which it can provide cash to its debt or equity holders through a dividend prepayment of indebtedness repurchase of stock repurchase of debt or other means whether the company undertakes additional stock repurchases or other aforementioned activities will depend on prevailing market conditions the company’s liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material in addition the company may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so 

the company’s ability to make scheduled interest payments on or to refinance the company’s indebtedness or to fund nonacquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on the company’s ability to generate cash in the future this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control based on its current levels of operations and absent any disruptive events management believes that internally generated funds and borrowings available under our revolving loan facility should provide sufficient resources to finance its operations nonacquisition related capital expenditures research and development efforts and longterm indebtedness obligations through at least fiscal 2012 there can be no assurance however that the company’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to the company under the senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its indebtedness or to fund its other 

  

liquidity needs the company may need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness on or before maturity also to the extent the company accelerates its growth plans consummates acquisitions or has lower than anticipated sales or increases in expenses the company may also need to raise additional capital in particular increased working capital needs occur whenever the company consummates acquisitions or experiences strong incremental demand there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the company has not at this time determined to change the nature of its debt facilities however in the future the company may increase its borrowings in connection with acquisitions if cash flow from operations becomes insufficient to fund current operations or for other shortterm cash needs or for stock repurchases or dividends our future leverage will also be impacted by the then current conditions of the credit markets 

operating activities the company generated 2606 million of cash from operating activities during fiscal 2011 compared to 1973 million during fiscal 2010 the net increase of 633 million was due primarily due to an increase in income from operations offset by higher interest payments and associated refinancing costs in connection with the company’s debt refinancing transactions during fiscal 2011 

the company generated 1973 million of cash from operating activities on net income of 1634 million during fiscal 2010 compared to 1971 million of cash from operating activities generated on net income of 1629 million during fiscal 2009 

investing activities cash used in investing activities was 13970 million during fiscal 2011 consisting primarily of the acquisitions of mckechnie aerospace talley actuation and schneller holdings for a total of 16504 million and capital expenditures of 180 million offset by the cash proceeds on the sale of the fastener business and aqs of 2714 million

net cash used in investing activities was 1684 million during fiscal 2009 consisting primarily of the acquisitions of the businesses of aircraft parts corporation acme and woodward hrt product line for a total of 1552 million and capital expenditures of 132 million

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

the board of directors and shareholders of 

transdigm group incorporated 

we have audited transdigm group incorporated’s internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2009 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria transdigm group incorporated’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our report dated november 24 2009 we expressed an unqualified opinion that transdigm group incorporated maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2009 based on the coso criteria management has subsequently determined that a deficiency in internal controls related to the application of the twoclass method in calculating basic and diluted of earnings per share existed as of the previous assessment date and has further concluded that such a deficiency represented a material weakness as of september 30 2009 as a result management has revised its assessment as presented in item 9a “management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” to conclude that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of september 30 2009 accordingly our present opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2009 as expressed herein is different from that expressed in our previous report 

a material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis in its assessment management has identified a material weakness in controls related to the application of the twoclass method in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of transdigm group incorporated and subsidiaries as of september 30 2009 and 2008 and the related consolidated statements of income shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended september 30 2009 this material weakness was considered in determining the nature timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the fiscal 2009 consolidated financial statements and this report does not affect our report dated november 24 2009 except for notes 5 and 21 as to which the date is february 10 2010 on these consolidated financial statements 

in our opinion because of the effect of the material weakness described above in the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria transdigm group incorporated has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2009 based on the coso criteria

 item 1 business tableend the company 

transdigm inc was formed in july 1993 in connection with the acquisition of certain businesses from imo industries inc transdigm group incorporated “td group” was formed in july 2003 at the direction of warburg pincus private equity viii lp “warburg pincus” to facilitate the acquisition of transdigm inc in march 2006 certain stockholders of td group and certain members of our management sold shares of td group common stock in an underwritten initial public offering td group did not offer any shares of common stock for sale in the initial public offering and td group did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders as a result of the initial public offering td group’s common stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “tdg” 

in may 2007 certain of td group’s stockholders including certain members of our management sold shares of td group’s common stock in an underwritten public offering as a result of this offering td group was no longer a “controlled company” for the purposes of the nyse listing requirements td group did not sell any shares in the offering and did not receive any proceeds from the offering 

we believe we are a leading global designer producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers 

we estimate that over 95 of our net sales for fiscal year 2009 were generated by proprietary products for which we own the design in addition for fiscal year 2009 we estimate that we generated approximately 80 of our net sales from products for which we are the sole source provider 

most of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue once our parts are designed into and sold as original equipment on an aircraft we generate net sales from recurring aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft which is generally estimated to be approximately 30 years we estimate that approximately 60 of our net sales in fiscal year 2009 were generated from aftermarket sales the vast majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets these aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and been more stable than sales to original equipment manufacturers or oems 

products 

we primarily design produce and supply highlyengineered proprietary aerospace components and certain systemssubsystems with significant aftermarket content we seek to develop highly customized products to solve specific needs for aircraft operators and manufacturers we attempt to differentiate ourselves based on engineering service and manufacturing capabilities we typically choose not to compete for nonproprietary “build to print” business because it frequently offers lower margins than proprietary products we believe that our products have strong brand names within the industry and that we have a reputation for high quality reliability and customer support 

our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products that we offer to our customers some of our more significant product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include 1 mechanical electromechanical actuators and controls used in numerous actuation applications 2 ignition systems and components such as igniters exciters and spark plugs used to start and spark turbine and reciprocating aircraft engines 3 gear pumps used primarily in lubrication and fuel applications 4 specialized valves used in fuel hydraulic and pneumatic applications 5 engineered connectors used in fuel pneumatic and hydraulic applications 6 power conditioning devices used to modify and control electrical power 7 specialized fluorescent lighting 8 specialized acdc electric motors and components 

  

9 aircraft audio systems 10 engineered latching and locking devices used in various bin security and other applications 11 lavatory hardware and components 12 rods and locking devices used primarily to hold open cowlings to allow access to engines for maintenance 13 specialized cockpit displays 14 elastomers used in various clamping and heating applications 15 nicad batterieschargers used to provide starting and backup power and 16 starter generators and related components 

sales and marketing 

consistent with our overall strategy our sales and marketing organization is structured to continually develop technical solutions that meet customer needs in particular we attempt to focus on products and programs that will lead to highmargin repeatable sales in the aftermarket 

we have structured our sales efforts along our major product offerings assigning a product manager to certain products each product manager is expected to grow the sales and profitability of the products for which he or she is responsible and to achieve the targeted annual level of bookings sales new business and profitability for such products the product managers are assisted by account managers and sales engineers who are responsible for covering major oem and aftermarket accounts account managers and sales engineers are expected to be familiar with the personnel organization and needs of specific customers to achieve total bookings and new business goals at each account and together with the product managers to determine when additional resources are required at customer locations most of our sales personnel are compensated in part on their bookings and their ability to identify and obtain new business opportunities 

though typically performed by employees the account manager function may be performed by independent representatives depending on the specific customer product and geographic location we also use a number of distributors to provide logistical support as well as primary customer contact with certain smaller accounts our major distributors are aviall inc a subsidiary of the boeing company and satair as 

manufacturing and engineering 

we maintain fifteen principal manufacturing facilities each manufacturing facility comprises manufacturing distribution and engineering as well as administrative functions including management sales and finance we continually strive to improve productivity and reduce costs including rationalization of operations developing improved control systems that allow for accurate product profit and loss accounting investing in equipment tooling and information systems and implementing broadbased employee training programs management believes that our manufacturing systems and equipment contribute to our ability to compete by permitting us to meet the rigorous tolerances and cost sensitive price structure of aircraft component customers 

we attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by producing uniquely engineered products with high quality and timely delivery our engineering costs are recorded in cost of sales and in selling and administrative captions in our statements of income total engineering expense represents approximately 9 of our operating units’ aggregate costs or approximately 5 of our consolidated net sales our proprietary products and particularly our new product initiatives are designed by our engineering staff and are intended to serve the needs of the aircraft component industry these proprietary designs must withstand the extraordinary conditions and stresses that will be endured by products during use and meet the rigorous demands of our customers’ tolerance and quality requirements 

we use sophisticated equipment and procedures to attempt to ensure the quality of our products and comply with military specifications and federal aviation administration the “faa” and oem certification requirements we perform a variety of testing procedures including testing under different temperature humidity and altitude levels shock and vibration testing and xray fluorescent measurement these procedures together with other customer approved techniques for document process and quality control are used throughout our manufacturing facilities 

  

customers 

our customers include 1 distributors of aerospace components 2 worldwide commercial airlines including national and regional airlines 3 large commercial transport and regional and business aircraft oems 4 various armed forces of the united states and friendly foreign governments 5 defense oems 6 system suppliers and 7 various other industrial customers for the year ended september 30 2009 boeing which includes aviall inc a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world accounted for approximately 13 of our net sales and honeywell international inc accounted for approximately 9 of our net sales products supplied to many of our customers including the two largest customers are used on multiple platforms 

active commercial production programs include the boeing 737 747 767 and 777 the airbus a300 a3192021 a330a340 and a380 the bombardier crj’s and challenger the embraer rj’s the cessna citation family the raytheon premier and hawker and most gulfstream airframes military platforms include aircraft such as the boeing c17 f15 and f18 the lockheed martin c130j and f16 the northrop grumman e2c hawkeye the joint strikefighter and the blackhawk chinook and apache helicopters transdigm has been awarded numerous contracts for the development of engineered products for production on the boeing 787 and airbus a350xwb and a400m programs 

we believe that we have strong customer relationships with almost all large commercial transport regional general aviation and military oems the demand for our aftermarket parts and services depends on among other things the breadth of our installed oem base revenue passenger miles or rpms the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and to a lesser extent airline profitability we believe that we are also a leading supplier of components used on us designed military aircraft including components that are used on a variety of fighter aircraft military freighters and military helicopters 

competition 

the niche markets within the aerospace industry that we serve are relatively fragmented and we face several competitors for many of the products and services we provide due to the global nature of the commercial aircraft industry competition in these categories comes from both us and foreign companies competitors in our product offerings range in size from divisions of large public corporations that have significantly greater financial technological and marketing resources than we do to small privatelyheld entities with only one or two components in their entire product portfolios 

we compete on the basis of engineering manufacturing and marketing high quality products which we believe meet or exceed the performance and maintenance requirements of our customers consistent and timely delivery and superior customer service and support the industry’s stringent regulatory certification and technical requirements and the investments necessary in the development and certification of products create barriers to entry for potential new competitors as long as customers receive products that meet or exceed expectations and performance standards we believe that they will have a reduced incentive to certify another supplier because of the cost and time of the technical design and testing certification process in addition we believe that concerns about safety and flight delays if products are unavailable or undependable are reasons for our customers to continue longterm supplier relationships 

government contracts 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 1 suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations 2 terminate existing contracts 3 reduce the value of existing contracts 4 audit our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs and 5 control and potentially prohibit the export of our products 

  

as described elsewhere in this report five of our divisions and subsidiaries have been subject to a us department of defense the “dod” office of inspector general review of our records for the purpose of determining whether the dod’s various buying offices negotiated “fair and reasonable” prices for spare parts purchased from those five divisions and subsidiaries in fiscal years 2002 through 2004 for additional information regarding the details and status of the pricing review please refer to “risk factors—certain of our divisions and subsidiaries have been subject to a pricing review by the dod office of inspector general” 

governmental regulation 

the commercial aircraft component industry is highly regulated by both the faa in the united states and by the joint aviation authorities in europe and other agencies throughout the world while the military aircraft component industry is governed by military quality specifications we and the components we manufacture are required to be certified by one or more of these entities or agencies and in many cases by individual oems in order to engineer and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models 

we must also satisfy the requirements of our customers including oems and airlines that are subject to faa regulations and provide these customers with products and services that comply with the government regulations applicable to commercial flight operations in addition the faa requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components we believe that we currently satisfy or exceed these maintenance standards in our repair and overhaul services we also maintain several faa approved repair stations 

in addition sales of many of our products that will be used on aircraft owned by nonus entities are subject to compliance with us export control laws 

our operations are also subject to a variety of worker and community safety laws the occupational safety and health act mandates general requirements for safe workplaces for all employees in addition osha provides special procedures and measures for the handling of certain hazardous and toxic substances 

raw materials 

we require the use of various raw materials in our manufacturing processes we also purchase a variety of manufactured component parts from various suppliers at times we concentrate our orders among a few suppliers in order to strengthen our supplier relationships raw materials and component parts are generally available from multiple suppliers at competitive prices 

intellectual property 

we have various trade secrets proprietary information trademarks trade names patents copyrights and other intellectual property rights which we believe in the aggregate but not individually are important to our business 

backlog 

as of september 30 2009 the company estimated its sales order backlog at 402 million compared to an estimated sales order backlog of 418 million as of september 30 2008 this decrease in backlog of 16 million is mainly due to lower commercial oem and aftermarket demand including the impact of order cancellations and pushouts as well as significant reductions in business jet production rates these declines were partially offset by the impact of the acquisitions of aircraft parts corporation acme aerospace inc and a product line of woodward governor company the majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of september 30 2009 are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months purchase orders may be subject to cancellation by the customer prior to shipment the level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of the company’s receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled accordingly the company’s backlog as of september 30 2009 may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period 

  

foreign operations 

although we manufacture substantially all of our products in the united states we manufacture some products in malaysia through our whollyowned malaysian subsidiary we sell our products in the united states as well as in foreign countries substantially all of our foreign sales are transacted in us dollars and therefore we have no material exposure to fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the us dollar as a result of foreign sales in addition the amount of components or other raw materials or supplies that we purchase from foreign suppliers including our malaysian manufacturing subsidiary are not material with substantially all such transactions being made in us dollars accordingly we have no material exposure to currency fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the us dollar arising from these transactions 

our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately 1504 million 1443 million and 1430 million for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks including the impact of foreign government regulations political uncertainties and differences in business practices there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments’ countries furthermore there can be no assurance that the political cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 

environmental matters 

our operations and facilities are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations governing among other matters the emission discharge generation management transportation and disposal of hazardous materials wastes and pollutants the investigation and remediation of contaminated sites and permits required in connection with our operations although management believes that our operations and facilities are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws management cannot provide assurance that future changes in such laws or the regulations or requirements thereunder or in the nature of our operations will not require us to make significant additional expenditures to ensure compliance in the future further we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and sanctions and third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws relevant common law or the environmental permits required for our operations 

under some environmental laws a current or previous owner or operator of a contaminated site may be held liable for the entire cost of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous materials at such property whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials persons who arrange for disposal or treatment of hazardous materials also may be liable for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of those substances at a disposal or treatment site regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by them because we own andor operate a number of facilities that have a history of industrial or commercial use and because we arrange for the disposal of hazardous materials at many disposal sites we may and do incur costs for investigation removal and remediation contaminants have been detected at some of our present and former sites principally in connection with historical operations and investigations andor cleanups have been undertaken by us or by former owners of the sites we receive inquiries and notices of potential liability with respect to offsite disposal facilities from time to time although we have not incurred any material investigation or cleanup costs to date and investigation and cleanup costs are not expected to be material in the future the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at these or other sites or the failure of any other potentially liable party to meet its obligations could result in significant liability for us 

employees 

as of september 30 2009 we had approximately 2000 employees approximately 4 of our employees were represented by the united steelworkers union approximately 3 were represented by the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america and approximately 4 were 

  

represented by the international brotherhood of electrical workers collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire in april 2011 november 2012 and may 2013 respectively we consider our relationship with our employees generally to be satisfactory 

legal proceedings 

we are from time to time subject to and are presently involved in litigation or other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business based upon information currently known to us we believe the outcome of such proceedings will not have individually or in the aggregate a material adverse effect on our business our financial condition or results of operations

 item 1a risk factors tableend set forth below are important risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business and financial condition and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

our business is sensitive to the number of flight hours that our customers’ planes spend aloft the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and our customers’ profitability these items are in turn affected by general economic conditions 

our business is directly affected by among other factors changes in revenue passenger miles “rpms” the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and to a lesser extent changes in the profitability of the commercial airline industry rpms and airline profitability have historically been correlated with the general economic environment although national and international events also play a key role for example in recent years the airline industry has been severely affected by the downturn in the global economy higher fuel prices the increased security concerns among airline customers following the events of september 11 2001 the severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars epidemic and the conflicts in afghanistan and iraq as a result of the substantial reduction in airline traffic resulting from these events the airline industry incurred and some in the industry continue to incur large losses and financial difficulties some carriers have also parked or retired a portion of their fleets and have reduced workforces and flights during periods of reduced airline profitability some airlines may delay purchases of spare parts preferring instead to deplete existing inventories if demand for new aircraft and spare parts decreases there would be a decrease in demand for certain of our products 

future terrorist attacks may have a material adverse impact on our business 

following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks passenger traffic on commercial flights was significantly lower than prior to the attacks and many commercial airlines reduced their operating schedules overall the terrorist attacks resulted in billions of dollars in losses to the airline industry any future acts of terrorism and any military response to such acts could result in further acts of terrorism and additional hostilities including possible retaliatory attacks on sovereign nations as well as financial economic and political instability while the precise effects of any such terrorist attack military response or instability on our industry and our business is difficult to determine it could result in further reductions in the use of commercial aircraft if demand for new aircraft and spare parts decreases demand for certain of our products would also decrease 

our sales to manufacturers of aircraft are cyclical and a downturn in sales to these manufacturers may adversely affect us 

our sales to manufacturers of large commercial aircraft such as the boeing company airbus sas related oem suppliers as well as manufacturers of business jets which accounted for approximately 22 of our net sales in fiscal year 2009 have historically experienced periodic downturns in the past these sales have been affected by airline profitability which is impacted by among other things fuel and labor costs price competition downturns in the global economy and national and international events such as the events of september 11 2001 in addition sales of our products to manufacturers of business jets are impacted by among other things downturns in the global economy prior downturns have adversely affected our net sales gross margin and net income 

we rely heavily on certain customers for much of our sales 

our two largest customers for fiscal year 2009 were boeing which includes aviall inc a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world and honeywell international inc these two customers accounted for approximately 13 and 9 respectively of our net sales in fiscal year 2009 our top ten customers for fiscal year 2009 accounted for approximately 44 of our net sales a reduction in purchasing by one of our larger customers for any reason such as economic downturn decreased production or strike could have a material adverse effect on our net sales gross margin and net income see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—overview” 

  

we generally do not have guaranteed future sales of our products further when we enter into fixed price contracts with some of our customers we take the risk for cost overruns 

as is customary in our business we do not generally have longterm contracts with most of our aftermarket customers and therefore do not have guaranteed future sales although we have longterm contracts with many of our oem customers many of those customers may terminate the contracts on short notice and in most cases our customers have not committed to buy any minimum quantity of our products in addition in certain cases we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon the historic purchasing patterns of customers and upon our discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements and this anticipated future volume of orders may not materialize 

we also have entered into multiyear fixedprice contracts with some of our customers pursuant to which we have agreed to perform the work for a fixed price and accordingly realize all the benefit or detriment resulting from any decreases or increases in the costs of making these products sometimes we accept a fixedprice contract for a product that we have not yet produced and this increases the risk of cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product most of our contracts do not permit us to recover increases in raw material prices taxes or labor costs 

us military spending is dependent upon the us defense budget 

the military and defense market is significantly dependent upon government budget trends particularly the dod budget in addition to normal business risks our supply of products to the united states government is subject to unique risks largely beyond our control future dod budgets could be negatively impacted by several factors including but not limited to a change in defense spending policy by the current presidential administration the us government’s budget deficits spending priorities the cost of sustaining the us military presence in iraq and afghanistan and possible political pressure to reduce us government military spending each of which could cause the dod budget to remain unchanged or to decline a significant decline in us military expenditures in the future could result in a reduction in the amount of our products sold to the various agencies and buying organizations of the us government 

we intend to pursue future acquisitions our business may be adversely affected if we cannot consummate acquisitions on satisfactory terms or if we cannot effectively integrate acquired operations 

a significant portion of our growth has occurred through acquisitions any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions we intend to pursue acquisitions that we believe will present opportunities consistent with our overall business strategy however we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates to purchase or may be unable to acquire desired businesses or assets on economically acceptable terms in addition we may not be able to raise the capital necessary to fund future acquisitions in addition acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect 

we regularly engage in discussions with respect to potential acquisition and investment opportunities if we consummate an acquisition our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly future acquisitions could likely result in the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest and amortization expenses or periodic impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets as well as significant charges relating to integration costs 

in addition we may not be able to successfully integrate any business we acquire into our existing business the successful integration of new businesses depends on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs the successful integration of future acquisitions may also require substantial attention from our 

  

senior management and the management of the acquired business which could decrease the time that they have to service and attract customers and develop new products and services in addition because we may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously we may encounter unforeseen expenses complications and delays including difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight 

we are subject to certain unique business risks as a result of supplying equipment and services to the us government in addition government contracts contain unfavorable termination provisions and are subject to modification and audit 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 

 

  

  

  

 most of our us government contracts can be terminated by the us government either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the contract termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination termination for default provisions provide for the contractor to be liable for excess costs incurred by the us government in procuring undelivered items from another source 

on contracts where the price is based on cost the us government may review our costs and performance as well as our accounting and general business practices based on the results of such audits the us government may adjust our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs in addition under us government purchasing regulations some of our costs including most financing costs amortization of intangible assets portions of research and development costs and certain marketing expenses may not be subject to reimbursement 

in addition to these us government contract risks we are at times required to obtain approval from us government agencies to export our products additionally we are not permitted to export some of our products a determination by the us government that we failed to receive required approvals or licenses could eliminate or restrict our ability to sell our products outside the united states and the penalties that could be imposed by the us government for failure to comply with these laws could be significant 

certain of our divisions and subsidiaries have been subject to a pricing review by the dod office of inspector general 

five of our divisions and subsidiaries have been the subject of a dod office of inspector general review of our records for the purpose of determining whether the dod’s various buying offices negotiated “fair and reasonable” prices for spare parts purchased from those divisions and subsidiaries during fiscal years 2002 through 2004 on april 19 2006 the inspector general issued its final report dated february 23 2006 and made public a redacted version of the report the report recommends i that the defense logistics agency request that those five subsidiaries and divisions voluntarily refund in the aggregate approximately 26 million for allegedly overpriced parts and ii that defense logistics agency contracting officers reevaluate their procedures for determining the reasonableness of pricing for sole source spare parts purchased from those divisions and subsidiaries and seek to develop strategic supplier alliances with those divisions and subsidiaries 

  

our position has been and continues to be that our pricing has been fair and reasonable and that there is no legal basis for the amount suggested as a refund by the inspector general in its report in response to the report we offered reasons why we disagree with the inspector general’s overall analysis and why computations related to the voluntary refund contained in the report fail to consider key data such as actual historical sales if the defense logistics agency requests a voluntary refund from any of our divisions or subsidiaries we would consider such a request under the circumstances existing at that time 

in february 2006 the defense logistics agency made a request to initiate discussions regarding future pricing and developing an acquisition strategy that would mutually strengthen our business relationship with the defense logistics agency around that time the parties discussed future purchasing but have not engaged in negotiations regarding strategic supplier alliances negotiations regarding strategic supplier alliances may occur at a later date as a result of those negotiations it is possible that the divisions and subsidiaries subject to the pricing review will enter into strategic supplier alliances with the defense logistics agency it is likely that in connection with any strategic supplier alliance the defense logistics agency will seek prices for parts based on cost it is also possible that the dod may seek alternative sources of supply for such parts the entry into strategic supplier alliances or a decision by the dod to pursue alternative sources of supply for parts we currently provide could reduce the amount of revenue we derive from and the profitability of certain of our supply arrangements with certain agencies and buying organizations of the us government 

our business may be adversely affected if we would lose our government or industry approvals or if more stringent government regulations are enacted or if industry oversight is increased 

the aerospace industry is highly regulated in the united states and in other countries in order to sell our components we and the components we manufacture must be certified by the faa the dod and similar agencies in foreign countries and by individual manufacturers if new and more stringent government regulations are adopted or if industry oversight increases we might incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or heightened industry oversight in addition if material authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended our business would be adversely affected 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and could harm our ability to react to changes to our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness including the notes 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of september 30 2009 our total indebtedness was approximately 13568 million including premium received net of amortization in connection with the issuance of the original notes which was approximately 624 of our total capitalization 

in addition to the foregoing indebtedness outstanding on september 30 2009 in october 2009 transdigm inc issued 425 million aggregate principal amount of 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes “new 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes” at an issue price of 97125 of the principal amount thereof pursuant to an indenture dated october 6 2009 the “new indenture” and together with the indenture referred to below the “indentures” the terms of the new 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes are substantially identical to the terms of the already outstanding 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes that were issued and sold by transdigm inc in june 2006 and february 2007 the proceeds from the issuance of the new 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes after the original issue discount were used to make a cash distribution to td group which paid a special cash dividend to its stockholders of approximately 375 million made dividend equivalent payments to its holders of stock options of approximately 30 million and paid for transactionrelated fees and expenses our total indebtedness on a pro forma basis as if the new 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes were issued and the special dividend was paid on september 30 2009 represents approximately 81 of our capitalization 

in addition we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future for example as of september 30 2009 we had 1980 million of unused commitments under our revolving loan facility although 

  

our senior secured credit facility the indenture the “indenture” governing the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes issued in june 2006 and february 2007 the “7 3  4  senior subordinated notes” and the new indenture contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these qualifications and exceptions could be substantial if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage would increase 

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to investors for example it could 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition all of our debt under the senior secured credit facility which includes a 780 million term loan facility and a revolving loan facility of 200 million bears interest at floating rates accordingly in the event that interest rates increase our debt service expense will also increase in order to reduce the floating interest rate risk as of september 30 2009 the company was party to an interest rate swap agreement that fixes the rate of interest on 300 million of debt under the senior secured credit facility 

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness including the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes and the new 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital 

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make payments on our indebtedness including the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes and the new 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes and amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility and to fund our operations will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future which to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot assure you however that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness including the amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility and the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes and the new 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes or to fund our other liquidity needs if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital 

  

investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital we cannot assure you that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations the terms of existing or future debt instruments the indenture and the senior secured credit facility may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives in addition any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms and would otherwise adversely affect the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes and the new 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes 

the terms of the senior secured credit facility and the indenture may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

our senior secured credit facility and the indentures contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indentures and may limit their ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests the senior secured credit facility and indenture include covenants restricting among other things the ability of td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indentures to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the indenture if any such default occurs the lenders under the senior secured credit facility and the holders of the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes and the holders of the new 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder to be immediately due and payable the lenders under the senior secured credit facility also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings in addition following an event of default under the senior secured credit facility the lenders under that facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which includes our available cash and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes and the new 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes if the debt under the senior secured credit facility or the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes andor the new 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt 

  

we are dependent on our highly trained employees and any work stoppage or difficulty hiring similar employees could adversely affect our business 

because our products are complicated and highly engineered we depend on an educated and trained workforce there is substantial competition for skilled personnel in the aircraft component industry and we could be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled employees we may not be able to fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover or attract and retain qualified personnel 

as of september 30 2009 we had approximately 2000 employees approximately 4 of our employees were represented by the united steelworkers union approximately 3 were represented by the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america and approximately 4 were represented by the international brotherhood of electrical workers collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire in april 2011 november 2012 and may 2013 respectively although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory we cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory renewal of these collective bargaining agreements or that our employee relations will remain stable because we maintain a relatively small inventory of finished goods any work stoppage could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide products to our customers 

our business is dependent on the availability of certain components and raw materials from suppliers 

our business is affected by the price and availability of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our components our business therefore could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our suppliers such as the destruction of our suppliers’ facilities or their distribution infrastructure a work stoppage or strike by our suppliers’ employees or the failure of our suppliers to provide materials of the requisite quality or by increased costs of such raw materials or components if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers because we maintain a relatively small inventory of raw materials and component parts our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers or alternative raw materials or component parts the lengthy and expensive faa and oem certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier raw material or component part 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under such environmental laws and regulations 

our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things discharges of pollutants into the air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and the remediation of contamination we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and sanctions andor third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws relevant common law or the environmental permits required for our operations 

pursuant to certain environmental laws a current or previous owner or operator of a contaminated site may be held liable for the entire cost of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous materials at such property whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of any hazardous materials persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials may also be held liable for such costs related to a disposal or treatment site regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by them contaminants have been detected at some of our present and former sites principally in connection with historical operations and investigations andor cleanups have been undertaken by us or by former owners of the sites we also receive inquiries and notices of potential liability with respect to offsite disposal facilities from time to time although we are not aware of any sites for which material obligations exist the discovery of additional contaminants the imposition of additional cleanup obligations or the initiation of suits for personal injury or damages to property or natural resources could result in significant liability 

  

we have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets which may never generate the returns we expect 

mergers and acquisitions have resulted in significant increases in identifiable intangible assets and goodwill identifiable intangible assets which primarily include trademarks trade names trade secrets license agreements and technology were approximately 3729 million at september 30 2009 representing approximately 15 of our total assets goodwill recognized in accounting for the mergers and acquisitions was approximately 14623 million at september 30 2009 representing approximately 60 of our total assets we may never realize the full value of our identifiable intangible assets and goodwill and to the extent we were to determine that our identifiable intangible assets or our goodwill were impaired within the meaning of applicable accounting regulations we would be required to writeoff the amount of any impairment 

we face significant competition 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry and compete against a number of companies including divisions of larger companies some of which have significantly greater resources than we do and therefore may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can competitors in our product lines are both us and foreign companies and range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privately held entities we believe that our ability to compete depends on high product performance consistent high quality short leadtime and timely delivery competitive pricing superior customer service and support and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs we may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive 

we could be adversely affected if one of our components causes an aircraft to crash 

our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we have designed manufactured or serviced while we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future products liability claims in the event of product liability claims our insurers may attempt to deny coverage or any coverage we have may not be adequate we also may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost any liability not covered by insurance or for which third party indemnification is not available could result in significant liability to us 

in addition a crash caused by one of our components could damage our reputation for quality products we believe our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting a provider of aircraft components if a crash were to be caused by one of our components or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected 

our stock prices may be volatile and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 

there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities which is unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities these broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the purchase price due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects including possible changes due to the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry and other factors such as fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering which could cause shortterm swings in profit margins or unrelated to our operating performance including market conditions affecting the stock market generally or the stocks of aerospace companies more specifically 

  

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our share price 

we may sell additional shares of common stock into the public markets or issue convertible debt securities to raise capital in the future the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public markets or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities to raise capital at a time and price that we deem appropriate 

our corporate documents and delaware law contain certain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable for example our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 149600000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock without stockholder approval the board of directors has the authority to attach special rights including voting and dividend rights to this preferred stock with these rights holders of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us in addition our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered board of directors whereby directors serve for threeyear terms with approximately onethird of the directors coming up for reelection each year having a staggered board will make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of our board of directors through a proxy contest which may be a necessary step in an acquisition of us that is not favored by our board of directors our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75 of the voting power of our issued and outstanding capital stock voting together as a single class is required for the alteration amendment or repeal of certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation including the provisions authorizing a staggered board and certain provisions of our amended and restated bylaws including the provisions relating to our stockholders’ ability to call special meetings notice provisions for stockholder business to be conducted at an annual meeting requests for stockholder lists and corporate records nomination and removal of directors and filling of vacancies on our board of directors 

we are also subject to the antitakeover provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law under these provisions if anyone becomes an “interested stockholder” we may not enter into a “business combination” with that person for three years without special approval which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change of control for purposes of section 203 “interested stockholder” means generally someone owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years subject to certain exceptions as described in section 203 

we do not intend to pay regular cash dividends on our stock 

notwithstanding the special cash dividend paid in october 2009 we do not anticipate declaring or paying regular cash dividends on our common stock or any other equity security in the foreseeable future the amounts that may be available to us to pay cash dividends are restricted under our debt and other agreements any payment of cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations earnings capital requirements financial condition future prospects contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors therefore you should not rely on dividend income from shares of our common stock

overview 

we believe we are a leading global designer producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers some of our more significant product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and components gear pumps specialized valves engineered connectors power conditioning devices specialized fluorescent lighting specialized acdc electric motors aircraft audio systems engineered latches and cockpit security devices lavatory hardware and components hold open rods and locking devices specialized cockpit displays elastomers nicad batteries and chargers starter generators and related components each of these product offerings consists of many individual products that are typically customized to meet the needs of a particular aircraft platform or customer 

for fiscal year 2009 we generated net sales of 7616 million and net income of 1629 million in addition for fiscal year 2009 our ebitda was 3629 million or 477 of net sales our ebitda as defined was 3747 million or 492 of net sales and our capital expenditures were 132 million or 17 of net sales see “ebitda and ebitda as defined” below for certain information regarding ebitda and ebitda as defined including a reconciliation of net income to ebitda and ebitda as defined and a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to ebitda and ebitda as defined 

we estimate that over 95 of our net sales for fiscal year 2009 were generated by proprietary products for which we own the design these products are generally approved and certified by airframe manufacturers who often certify only one manufacturer’s component design for a specific application on an aircraft government agencies andor the faa and similar entities or agencies in addition for fiscal year 2009 we estimate that we generated approximately 80 of our net sales from products for which we are the sole source provider 

most of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue once our parts are designed into and sold as original equipment on an aircraft we generate net sales from recurring aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft this installed base and our sole source provider position generate a longterm stream of aftermarket revenues over the estimated 30year life of an individual aircraft we estimate that approximately 60 of our net sales in fiscal year 2009 were generated from aftermarket sales the vast majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets these aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and have been more stable than sales to oems 

in fiscal year 2009 our top two customers accounted for approximately 22 of our net sales and during this same period our top ten customers accounted for approximately 44 of our net sales however our components are ultimately used on a large diverse installed base of aircraft and therefore we are not overly dependent on any single airframe produced by any of our customers or other ultimate endusers of our products in the commercial aerospace sector which generated approximately 65 of our net sales for fiscal year 2009 we sell to distributors of aftermarket components as well as directly to commercial airlines aircraft maintenance facilities systems suppliers and aircraft and engine oems in addition for fiscal year 2009 approximately 32 of our net sales were attributable to the defense aerospace sector net sales to the defense sector are generated 

  

primarily through sales to the united states and foreign militaries brokers distributors and defense oems the remaining portion of our net sales in fiscal year 2009 or approximately 3 of our net sales during this period were derived from industries with similar niche engineered product characteristics such as the mining and power generation industries 

public offerings 

on may 25 2007 certain of td group’s stockholders including certain members of our management sold an aggregate of 115 million shares of td group’s common stock in an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of 3525 per share td group did not sell any shares in the offering and did not receive any proceeds from the offering 

on march 20 2006 certain stockholders of td group and certain members of our management sold an aggregate of 126 million shares of td group’s common stock in the initial public offering at a price of 2100 per share td group did not offer any shares of its common stock for sale in the initial public offering and td group did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of such shares by the selling stockholders as a result of the initial public offering td group’s common stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “tdg”

      trend information 

we predominantly serve customers in the commercial regional business jet and general aviation aftermarket which accounts for approximately 40 of total sales the commercial aerospace oem market comprising large commercial transport manufacturers and regional and business jet manufacturers which accounts for approximately 25 of total sales and the defense market which accounts for approximately 32 of total sales nonaerospace sales comprise approximately 3 of our total sales 

the commercial aerospace industry including the aftermarket and oem market is impacted by the health of the global economy and geopolitical events around the world the commercial aerospace industry had shown strength with increases in revenue passenger miles or rpms between 2003 and 2008 as well as increases in oem production and backlog however the global economic downturn airline capacity reductions and concerns over the financial credit markets have negatively impacted the commercial aerospace industry causing rpms to decline slightly in 2009 the defense aerospace market is dependent on government budget constraints the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts it is not necessarily affected by general economic conditions that affect the commercial aerospace industry 

our presence in both the commercial aerospace and military sectors of the aerospace industry may mitigate the impact on our business of any specific industry risk we service a diversified customer base in the commercial and military aerospace industry and we provide components to a diverse installed base of aircraft which mitigates our exposure to any individual airframe platform at times declines in sales in one sector have been offset by increased sales in another however due to differences between the profitability of our products sold to oem and aftermarket customers variation in product mix can cause variation in gross margin 

there are many shortterm factors including inventory corrections unannounced changes in order patterns strikes and mergers and acquisitions that can cause shortterm disruptions in our quarterly shipment patterns as compared to previous quarters and the same periods in prior years to normalize for shortterm fluctuations we tend to look at our performance over several quarters or years of activity rather than discreet shortterm periods as such it can be difficult to determine longerterm trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons 

there are also fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering and delivery requests from quartertoquarter as well as variations in product mix from quartertoquarter that may cause positive or negative variations in gross profit margins since commercial aftermarket sales have historically produced a higher gross margin than sales to commercial oems again in many instances these are timing events between quarters and must be balanced with macro aerospace industry indicators

the key growth factors in the commercial aftermarket include worldwide rpms and the size and activity level of the worldwide fleet of aircraft although rpms increased annually between 2003 and 2008 industry consensus indicates that 2009 will have had negative growth as a result of expected reductions in air traffic and capacity due to the slowdown in the global economy industry reports expect rpms to stabilize in 2010 and return to positive growth thereafter 

commercial oem market 

there is industry consensus that aircraft deliveries in the large commercial transport market sector aircraft with 100 or more seats may reach its peak in 2009 however there are conflicting industry opinions regarding the level of future deliveries but we believe deliveries may be flat or decrease going forward another indicator of future oem sales in this market is the order backlog at the boeing company and airbus sas despite a significant number of airplanes in the backlog current year orders for new airplanes have decreased from the prior year and the availability of financing is uncertain due to the current state of the credit markets furthermore the business jet oem market significantly declined in 2009 and is expected to continue to decrease in the near future this market has also been negatively impacted by the slowdown in economic growth corporate profits commodity prices and stock market returns across the world 

defense 

in recent years defense spending has reached historic highs due in part to the military engagements in afghanistan and iraq and the war on terrorism our military business fluctuates from year to year and is dependent to a degree on government budget constraints the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts we anticipate that military related sales of our types of products will be flat in 2010 over the current high levels 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations however investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 

we have identified the following as the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial status depends these critical policies were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments our most critical accounting policies are as follows 

revenue recognition and related allowances substantially all of our revenues are recognized based upon shipment of products to the customer at which time title and risk of loss passes to the customer substantially all sales are made pursuant to firm fixedprice purchase orders received from customers provisions for returns uncollectible accounts and the cost of repairs under contract warranty provisions are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are principally based on historical results modified as appropriate by the most current information available we have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of such allowances however due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process it is possible that actual results may vary from the estimates and the differences could be material 

management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable and customer creditworthiness the allowance also incorporates a provision for the estimated impact of disputes with customers management’s estimate of the allowance amounts that are necessary includes amounts for specifically identified losses and a general amount for estimated losses based on historical information the 

  

determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to significant levels of judgment and estimation by management if circumstances change or economic conditions deteriorate management may need to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company provides limited warranties in connection with the sale of its products the warranty period for products sold varies throughout the company’s operations ranging from 90 days to six years in addition certain contracts with distributors contain right of return provisions the company accrues for estimated returns and warranty claims based on knowledge of product performance issues and excess inventories provided by its customers and industry sources the company also provides a general amount based on historical results historically actual product returns and warranty claims have not differed materially from the estimates originally established 

inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost of inventories is determined by the average cost and the firstin firstout fifo methods for all locations except cef which determines the cost of inventories using the lastin firstout lifo method because the company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be inservice for 30 or more years it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use provision for potentially obsolete or slowmoving inventory is made based on our analysis of inventory levels past usage and future sales forecasts although management believes that the company’s estimates of obsolete and slowmoving inventory are reasonable actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future in addition in accordance with industry practice all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year 

intangible assets mergers and acquisitions have resulted in significant amounts of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights or if the intangible asset can be sold transferred licensed or exchanged regardless of the company’s intent to do so goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates the determination of undiscounted cash flows is based on the company’s strategic plans and longrange planning forecasts the revenue growth rates included in the plans are based on industry and company specific data the profit margin assumptions included in the plans are projected based on the current cost structure and anticipated cost changes if different assumptions were used in these plans the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different and the recognition of an impairment loss might be required intangible assets such as goodwill trademarks and trade names that have an indefinite useful life are not amortized all other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 

gaap requires that the annual and any interim impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level the reporting unit level is the operating subsidiary level for the company substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each operating subsidiary pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction and therefore the allocation of goodwill among reporting units was immaterial for purposes of the impairment assessment certain of the acquisitions were or are being integrated into an existing operating subsidiary and therefore any related goodwill is combined with goodwill of the operating subsidiary 

stock options and deferred compensation plans the company accounts for the cost of its stock options in accordance with gaap  which requires the measurement of compensation expense under the stock option plan to be based on the fair value of the awards under the plan on the grant dates and amortizes the expense over the options’ vesting periods compensation expense is recorded over the service period using the straightline method for servicebased awards and in the service period corresponding to the performance target for performancebased awards in addition the company accounts for its deferred compensation plans by recording the cost of deferred compensation arrangements over the service period of the related employees in a systematic and rational manner 

  

purchase accounting our mergers and acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method accordingly fair value adjustments to the company’s assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition we generally use thirdparty appraisals to assist us in determining the fair value adjustments 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain operating data of the company including presentation of the amounts as a percentage of net sales amounts in thousands 

 

 fiscal year ended september 30 2009 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2008 

net sales net sales increased by 478 million or 67 to 7615 million for fiscal year 2009 from 7137 million for fiscal year 2008 sales of 647 million resulted from the acquisitions of cef and the unison product line in fiscal 2008 as well as the recent acquisitions of aircraft parts corporation acme and the woodward hrt product line 

sales declined excluding acquisitions by 169 million or 24 from the prior year the organic sales decline was primarily due to i a decrease of 304 million of commercial oem sales resulting primarily from the impact of the significant decline in production rates in the business jet market resulting from the continued impact of global economic conditions negatively impacting the business jet market and a reduction in sales to the boeing company due to its employee strike and ii a decrease of 201 million in commercial aftermarket sales due to the impact of the global economic downturn resulting in a decline in worldwide airline traffic and business jet activity partially offsetting the decline in organic commercial sales was an increase of 379 million in defense sales primarily due to increased demand for oem and aftermarket spare parts and repairs across most of our product lines 

cost of sales  cost of sales increased by 44 million or 14 to 3322 million for fiscal year 2009 from 3278 from fiscal year 2008 cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased to 436 for fiscal year 2009 from 459 for fiscal year 2008 the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to increased volume associated with the higher net sales of 478 million discussed above and higher acquisitionrelated costs of 34 million the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was primarily due the strength of the company’s proprietary products productivity improvements from continued cost reduction efforts and favorable product mix partially offset by the dilutive impact from recent acquisitions and higher acquisitionrelated costs 

selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased by 54 million or 72 to 800 million 105 of net sales for fiscal year 2009 from 746 million or 105 of net sales for fiscal year 2008 this increase was primarily due to the higher sales discussed above

the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was primarily due a decrease from acquisitionrelated costs discussed above the strength of the company’s proprietary products and continued productivity efforts partially offset by the impact from the acquisitions of ati bruce and cef

income taxes  income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately 356 for fiscal year 2008 compared to 376 for fiscal year 2007 the lower effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in state and local taxes an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction and the favorable resolution of a prior year irs audit and state tax refund of 12 million partially offset by a lower research and development tax credit 

net income net income increased 445 million or 502 to 1331 million for fiscal year 2008 compared to 886 million for fiscal year 2007 primarily as a result of the factors referred to above 

backlog 

as of september 30 2009 the company estimated its sales order backlog at 402 million compared to an estimated sales order backlog of 418 million as of september 30 2008 this decrease in backlog of 16 million is mainly due to lower commercial oem and aftermarket demand including the impact of order cancellations and pushouts as well as significant reductions in business jet production rates these declines were partially offset by the impact of the acquisitions of aircraft parts corporation acme and the woodward hrt product line the majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of september 30 2009 are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months purchase orders may be subject to cancellation by the customer prior to shipment the level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of the company’s receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled accordingly the company’s backlog as of september 30 2009 may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period 

foreign operations 

although we manufacture substantially all of our products in the united states we manufacture some products in malaysia through our whollyowned malaysian subsidiary we sell our products in the united states as well as in foreign countries substantially all of our foreign sales are transacted in us dollars and therefore we have no material exposure to fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the us dollar as a result of foreign sales in addition the amount of components or other raw materials or supplies that we purchase from foreign suppliers including our malaysian manufacturing subsidiary are not material with substantially all such transactions being made in us dollars accordingly we have no material exposure to currency fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the us dollar arising from these transactions 

our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately 1504 million 1443 million and 1430 million for fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively sales to foreign customers are subject to 

  

numerous additional risks including the impact of foreign government regulations political uncertainties and differences in business practices there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments’ countries furthermore there can be no assurance that the political cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 

inflation 

many of the company’s raw materials and operating expenses are sensitive to the effects of inflation which could result in changing operating costs the effects of inflation on the company’s businesses during the fiscal years 2009 2008 and 2007 were not significant 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating activities the company generated 1971 million of cash from operating activities during fiscal 2009 compared to 1896 million generated during fiscal 2008 the increase of 75 million in fiscal 2009 is primarily due to an increase in net income of 298 million partially offset by the payout of the deferred compensation liability of 62 and the change in income taxes receivable including the impact of the excess tax benefit from exercise of stock options of 128 million 

the company generated 1896 million of cash from operating activities during fiscal 2008 compared to 1124 million generated during fiscal 2008 the increase of 772 million in fiscal 2008 is primarily due to an increase in net income of 445 million and favorable changes in accounts receivable and inventory of approximately 310 million

description of current senior secured credit facility and indenture 

in june 2006 transdigm refinanced its entire debt structure in connection with the refinancing transdigm inc obtained a new senior secured credit facility the senior secured credit facility consisted of a 650 million term loan facility which was fully drawn at closing and a 150 million revolving loan facility in addition under 

  

the terms of the senior secured credit facility transdigm inc had the right to request but no lender was committed to provide additional term loans of up to 250 million subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions including pro forma compliance with the financial covenant contained in the senior secured credit facility after giving effect to any such incremental term loan borrowings 

in connection with the acquisition of ati in february 2007 transdigm inc entered into an amendment of the senior secured credit facility which provided for among other things i an additional term loan of 130 million ii a 50 million increase in the revolving credit facility bringing the total available revolver to 200 million and iii a 50 million increase in the uncommitted incremental loan facility to 300 million at september 30 2009 1980 million of the revolving credit facility was available 

the term loan facility will mature in june 2013 and is not subject to interim scheduled amortization but is subject to certain prepayment requirements under the amended terms of the senior secured credit facility commencing 90 days after the end of fiscal 2008 and each fiscal year thereafter transdigm inc is required to prepay outstanding term loans in a principal amount equal to 50 of excess cash flow as defined in the senior secured credit facility provided that the amount of the prepayment will be reduced to 25 of excess cash flow if the consolidated leverage ratio at the end of the applicable fiscal year is less than 500 to 100 but greater than 450 to 100 transdigm inc will not be required to prepay any of the term loans if the consolidated leverage ratio as of the end of the applicable fiscal year is equal to or less than 450 to 100 or if the term loans achieve certain minimum credit ratings at the end of such fiscal year “excess cash flow” is a negotiated definition generally designed to capture the cash that was generated by our business in excess of cash used in the business “consolidated leverage ratio” means the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to the aggregate amount of ebitda as defined calculated on a pro forma basis transdigm’s consolidated leverage ratio was approximately 35 to 100 at september 30 2009 thus the company was not obligated to make a prepayment of the term loans based upon the excess cash flow provision 

in addition subject to exceptions including reinvestment in productive assets transdigm inc is required to offer to prepay the term loans with the net proceeds of certain asset sales the revolving loan facility will mature and the commitments thereunder will terminate in june 2012 

the senior secured credit facility is guaranteed by td group and all of transdigm inc’s current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries and is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the existing and future property and assets of transdigm inc and all of transdigm inc’s existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries and a first priority pledge of the capital stock of transdigm inc and transdigm inc’s domestic subsidiaries 

the interest rates per annum applicable to loans other than swingline loans under the senior secured credit facility are at the company’s option equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted libo rate for one two three or sixmonth or to the extent available to each lender nine or twelve month interest periods chosen by transdigm inc in each case plus an applicable margin percentage the alternate base rate is the greater of 1 credit suisse’s prime rate or 2 50 basis points over the weighted average rates on overnight federal funds as published by the federal reserve bank of new york the adjusted libo rate is determined by reference to settlement rates established for deposits in dollars in the london interbank market for a period equal to the interest period of the loan as adjusted for the maximum reserve percentages established by the board of governors of the united states federal reserve the applicable margin percentage is a percentage per annum equal to 1 100 for alternate base rate term loans 2 200 for adjusted libo rate term loans 3 in the case of alternate base rate revolving loans and adjusted libo rate revolving loans a percentage which varies based on the consolidated leverage ratio of transdigm inc as of the relevant date of determination 

transdigm inc entered into a three year interest rate swap in june 2006 with credit suisse for an initial notional amount of 187 million at a fixed rate of 763 the notional amount decreased to 150 million on september 23 2008 and the swap agreement expired on june 23 2009 transdigm inc entered into an additional three year interest rate swap in january 2008 with credit suisse for the notional amount of 300 million at a fixed rate of 50 through march 2011 

  

in connection with the refinancing transdigm inc also issued 275 million aggregate principal amount of 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes as a result of the acquisition of ati transdigm inc issued an additional 300 million aggregate principal amount of 7   3  4  senior subordinated notes under the indenture dated as of june 23 2006 

such notes do not require principal payments prior to their maturity in july 2014 the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed jointly and severally and on an unsecured senior subordinated basis by td group and all of our existing domestic subsidiaries 

upon the closing of the ati acquisition the additional term loan of 130 million together with the net proceeds from the 300 million from the additional 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes and a portion of our cash balances was drawn to fund the approximately 430 million purchase price of ati 

new 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes 

in october 2009 transdigm issued 425 million aggregate principal amount of new 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes at an issue price of 97125 of the principal amount thereof pursuant to the new indenture dated october 6 2009 the terms of the new 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes are substantially identical to the terms of the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes that were issued and sold by transdigm in june 2006 and february 2007 

the proceeds from the issuance of the new 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes after the original issue discount were used to make a cash distribution to td group which paid a special cash dividend to its stockholders of approximately 375 million made dividend equivalent payments to its holders of stock options of approximately 30 million and paid for transactionrelated fees and expenses 

certain restrictive covenants in our debt documents 

both the senior secured credit facility and the indentures contain restrictive covenants that among other things limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness the payment of dividends transactions with affiliates asset sales acquisitions mergers and consolidations liens and encumbrances and prepayments of other indebtedness in addition the revolving loan facility under the senior secured credit facility requires transdigm inc to comply with a first lien leverage ratio a breach of any of the covenants or an inability to comply with the required leverage ratio could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the indentures if any such default occurs the lenders under the senior secured credit facility and the holders of the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes or the new 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder to be immediately due and payable the lenders under the senior secured credit facility also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings in addition following an event of default under the senior secured credit facility the lenders thereunder will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which includes our available cash and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes and the new 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes 

stock repurchase program 

in october 2008 we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed 50 million in the aggregate during 2009 we repurchased under this program 494100 shares of at an aggregate cost of approximately 152 million 

  

contractual obligations 

the following is a summary of contractual cash obligations as of september 30 2009 in millions 

 

  

  in addition to the contractual obligations set forth above the company issued 425 of new 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes due 2014 the annual scheduled interest payments under the new 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes will be approximately 33 million also the company incurs capital expenditures for the purpose of maintaining and replacing existing equipment and facilities and from time to time for facility expansion capital expenditures totaled approximately 132 million 109 million and 103 million during fiscal 2009 2008 and fiscal 2007 respectively the company expects its capital expenditures in fiscal 2010 to be between 15 million and 20 million and such expenditures are projected to increase moderately thereafter 

the company intends to pursue acquisitions that present opportunities consistent with the company’s business direction the company regularly engages in discussions with respect to potential acquisitions and investments however there can be no assurance that the company will be able to consummate an agreement with respect to any future acquisition the company’s acquisition strategy may require substantial capital and no assurance can be given that the company will be able to raise any necessary funds on acceptable terms or at all if the company incurs additional debt to finance acquisitions total interest expense will increase 

if the company has excess cash it may consider methods by which it can provide cash to its debt or equity holders through a dividend prepayment of indebtedness repurchase of stock or other means in october 2008 the company announced that its board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million in the aggregate of the company’s common stock during fiscal 2009 the company repurchased a total of 494100 shares at an aggregate cost of 152 million whether the company undertakes additional stock repurchases or other aforementioned activities will depend on prevailing market conditions the company’s liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material in addition the company may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so 

the company’s ability to make scheduled interest payments on or to refinance the company’s indebtedness or to fund nonacquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on the company’s ability to generate cash in the future this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control based on its current levels of operations and anticipated cost savings and operating improvements and absent any disruptive events management believes that internally generated funds and borrowings available under our revolving loan facility should provide sufficient resources to finance its operations nonacquisition related capital expenditures research and development efforts and longterm indebtedness obligations through at least fiscal 2010 there can be no assurance however that the company’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all or that future 

  

borrowings will be available to the company under the senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its indebtedness or to fund its other liquidity needs the company may need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness on or before maturity also to the extent the company accelerates its growth plans consummates acquisitions or has lower than anticipated sales or increases in expenses the company may also need to raise additional capital in particular increased working capital needs occur whenever the company consummates acquisitions or experiences strong incremental demand there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

new accounting standards 

new accounting standards adopted in fiscal 2009 

in june 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued authoritative guidance codifying gaap while the guidance was not intended to change gaap it did change the way the company references these accounting principles in the notes to the consolidated financial statements this guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after september 15 2009 the company’s adoption of this authoritative guidance as of september 30 2009 changed how it references gaap in its disclosures 

in may 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance establishing general standards of accounting and disclosures for events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued application of this authoritative guidance was required for interim or annual financial periods ending after june 15 2009 the company’s adoption of this guidance during fiscal 2009 resulted in additional disclosures see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued authoritative guidance that defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with gaap and also expands disclosures about fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date the adoption of this guidance for financial assets and liabilities effective october 1 2008 did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

in addition at various dates the fasb has issued authoritative guidance requiring additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments and derivatives and hedging activities that were effective for the company during fiscal 2009 the company’s adoption of this guidance resulted in additional disclosures see notes 17 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

new accounting standards not yet adopted 

in december 2007 the fasb issued authoritative guidance requiring assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination contingent consideration and certain acquired contingencies to be measured at their fair values as of the date of acquisition this guidance also requires that acquisitionrelated costs and restructuring costs be recognized separately from the business combination this authoritative guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and is therefore applicable to the company effective october 1 2009 the implementation of this guidance will affect the company’s results of operations and financial position after its effective date only to the extent it completes applicable business combinations subsequent to the effective date and therefore the impact of this guidance cannot be determined prior to the completion of any applicable business combination transactions 

additional disclosure required by indenture 

separate financial statements of transdigm inc are not presented since td group has no operations or significant assets separate from its investment in transdigm inc and since the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes and the new 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes are guaranteed by td group and all direct and indirect domestic

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixedrate and floatingrate longterm debt at september 30 2009 we had borrowings under our senior secured credit facility of 780 million that were subject to interest rate risk borrowings under our senior secured credit facility bear interest at our option at a rate equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted libo rate for a one two three or sixmonth or to the extent available to each lender nine or twelvemonth interest period chosen by us in each case plus an applicable margin percentage accordingly the company’s cash flows and earnings will be exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes resulting from variable rate borrowings under our senior secured credit facility the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the annual interest costs under our senior secured credit facility by approximately 78 million based on the amount of outstanding borrowings at september 30 2009 the weighted average interest rate on the 780 million of borrowings under our senior secured credit facility on september 30 2009 was 23 

at september 30 2009 we had an agreement in place to swap variable interest rates on our senior secured credit facility for fixed interest rates through march 23 2011 for the notional amount of 300 million the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement is adjusted at each balance sheet date with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income at september 30 2009 the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was a liability of 78 million 

the fair value of the 780 million aggregate principal amount of borrowings under the senior secured credit facility is exposed to the market risk of interest rates the estimated fair value of such term loan approximated 749 million at september 30 2009 based upon information provided to the company from its agent under the credit facility the fair value of the 575 million aggregate principal amount of our 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes is exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes the estimated fair value of such notes approximated 571 million at september 30 2009 based upon quoted market rates

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

 item 1 business tableend the company 

transdigm inc was formed in july 1993 in connection with the acquisition of certain businesses from imo industries inc transdigm group incorporated formerly known as td holding corporation or td group was formed in july 2003 at the direction of warburg pincus private equity viii lp or warburg pincus to facilitate the acquisition of transdigm inc 

on march 20 2006 certain stockholders of td group and certain members of our management sold an aggregate of approximately 126 million shares of td group common stock in an underwritten initial public offering or the initial public offering at a price of 2100 per share td group did not offer any shares of common stock for sale in the initial public offering and td group did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders as a result of the initial public offering td group’s common stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “tdg” 

on may 25 2007 certain of td group’s stockholders including certain members of our management sold an aggregate of 115 million shares of td group’s common stock in an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of 3525 per share as a result of this offering td group was no longer a “controlled company” for the purposes of the nyse listing requirements td group did not sell any shares in the offering and did not receive any proceeds from the offering 

we believe we are a leading global designer producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers some of our more significant product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and components gear pumps specialized valves engineered connectors power conditioning devices specialized fluorescent lighting and acdc electric motors aircraft audio systems engineered latches and cockpit security devices lavatory hardware and components hold open rods and locking devices specialized cockpit displays elastomers and nicad batterieschargers each of these product offerings consists of many individual products that are typically customized to meet the needs of a particular aircraft platform or customer 

we estimate that over 90 of our net sales for fiscal year 2008 were generated by proprietary products for which we own the design in addition for fiscal year 2008 we estimate that we generated approximately 75 of our net sales from products for which we are the sole source provider 

most of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue once our parts are designed into and sold as original equipment on an aircraft we generate net sales from recurring aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft which is generally estimated to be approximately 30 years we estimate that approximately 60 of our net sales in fiscal year 2008 were generated from aftermarket sales the vast majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets these aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and been more stable than sales to original equipment manufacturers or oems 

products 

we primarily design produce and supply highlyengineered proprietary aerospace components and certain systemsubsystems with significant aftermarket content we seek to develop highly customized products to solve specific needs for aircraft operators and manufacturers we attempt to differentiate ourselves based on engineering service and manufacturing capabilities we typically choose not to compete for nonproprietary “build to print” business because it frequently offers lower margins than proprietary products we believe that our products have strong brand names within the industry and that we have a reputation for high quality reliability and customer support 

  

our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products that we offer to our customers some of our more significant product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include 1 mechanical electromechanical actuators and controls used in numerous actuation applications2 ignition systems and components such as igniters exciters and spark plugs used to start and spark turbine and reciprocating aircraft engines 3 gear pumps used primarily in lubrication and fuel applications 4 specialized valves used in fuel hydraulic and pneumatic applications 5 engineered connectors used in fuel pneumatic and hydraulic applications 6 power conditioning devices used to modify and control electrical power 7 specialized fluorescent lighting 8 specialized acdc electric motors and components used in various defense and commercial applications 9 aircraft audio systems 10 engineered latching and locking devices used in various bin security and other applications 11 lavatory hardware and components 12 rods and locking devices used primarily to hold open cowlings to allow access to engines for maintenance 13 specialized cockpit displays 14 elastomers used in various clamping and heating applications and 15 nicad batterieschargers used to provide starting and backup power 

sales and marketing 

consistent with our overall strategy our sales and marketing organization is structured to continually develop technical solutions that meet customer needs in particular we attempt to focus on products and programs that will lead to highmargin repeatable sales in the aftermarket 

we have structured our sales efforts along our major product offerings assigning a product manager to certain products each product manager is expected to grow the sales and profitability of the products for which he or she is responsible and to achieve the targeted annual level of bookings sales new business and profitability for such products the product managers are assisted by account managers and sales engineers who are responsible for covering major oem and aftermarket accounts account managers and sales engineers are expected to be familiar with the personnel organization and needs of specific customers to achieve total bookings and new business goals at each account and together with the product managers to determine when additional resources are required at customer locations most of our sales personnel are compensated in part on their bookings and their ability to identify and obtain new business opportunities 

though typically performed by employees the account manager function may be performed by independent representatives depending on the specific customer product and geographic location we also use a number of distributors to provide logistical support as well as primary customer contact with certain smaller accounts our major distributors are aviall inc a subsidiary of the boeing company and satair as 

manufacturing and engineering 

we maintain twelve principal manufacturing facilities each manufacturing facility comprises manufacturing distribution and engineering as well as administrative functions including management sales and finance we continually strive to improve productivity and reduce costs including rationalization of operations developing improved control systems that allow for accurate product profit and loss accounting investing in equipment tooling and information systems and implementing broadbased employee training programs management believes that our manufacturing systems and equipment contribute to our ability to compete by permitting us to meet the rigorous tolerances and cost sensitive price structure of aircraft component customers 

we attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by producing uniquely engineered products with high quality and timely delivery our engineering costs are recorded in cost of sales and in selling and administrative captions in our statements of income total engineering expense represents approximately 8 to 9 of our operating units’ costs or approximately 4 to 5 of our net sales our proprietary products are designed by our engineering staff and are intended to serve the needs of the aircraft component industry particularly through our new product initiatives these proprietary designs must withstand the extraordinary conditions and stresses that will be endured by products during use and meet the rigorous demands of our customers’ tolerance and quality requirements 

  

we use sophisticated equipment and procedures to attempt to ensure the quality of our products and comply with military specifications and federal aviation administration or faa and oem certification requirements we perform a variety of testing procedures including testing under different temperature humidity and altitude levels shock and vibration testing and xray fluorescent measurement these procedures together with other customer approved techniques for document process and quality control are used throughout our manufacturing facilities 

customers 

our customers include 1 distributors of aerospace components 2 worldwide commercial airlines including national and regional airlines 3 large commercial transport and regional and business aircraft oems 4 various armed forces of the united states and friendly foreign governments 5 defense oems 6 system suppliers and 7 various other industrial customers for the year ended september 30 2008 boeing which includes aviall inc a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world accounted for approximately 14 of our net sales and honeywell international inc accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales products supplied to many of our customers including the two largest customers are used on multiple platforms 

active commercial production programs include the boeing 737 747 767 and 777 the airbus a300 a3192021 a330a340 and a380 the bombardier crj’s and challenger the embraer rj’s the cessna citation family the raytheon premier and hawker and most gulfstream airframes military platforms include aircraft such as the boeing c17 f15 and f18 the lockheed martin c130j and f16 the northrop grumman e2c hawkeye the joint strikefighter and the blackhawk chinook and apache helicopters transdigm has been awarded numerous contracts to develop engineered products for production on the boeing 787 and airbus a400m programs 

we believe that we have strong customer relationships with almost all large commercial transport regional general aviation and military oems the demand for our aftermarket parts and services depends on among other things the breadth of our installed oem base revenue passenger miles or rpms the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and to a lesser extent airline profitability we believe that we are also a leading supplier of components used on us designed military aircraft including components that are used on a variety of fighter aircraft military freighters and military helicopters 

competition 

the niche markets within the aerospace industry that we serve are relatively fragmented and we face several competitors for many of the products and services we provide due to the global nature of the commercial aircraft industry competition in these categories comes from both us and foreign companies competitors in our product offerings range in size from divisions of large public corporations that have significantly greater financial technological and marketing resources than we do to small privatelyheld entities with only one or two components in their entire product portfolios 

we compete on the basis of engineering manufacturing and marketing high quality products which we believe meet or exceed the performance and maintenance requirements of our customers consistent and timely delivery and superior customer service and support the industry’s stringent regulatory certification and technical requirements and the investments necessary in the development and certification of products create barriers to entry for potential new competitors so long as customers receive products that meet or exceed expectations and performance standards we believe that they will have a reduced incentive to certify another supplier because of the cost and time of the technical design and testing certification process in addition we believe that concerns about safety and flight delays if products are unavailable or undependable make our customers continue longterm supplier relationships 

  

government contracts 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 1 suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations 2 terminate existing contracts 3 reduce the value of existing contracts 4 audit our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs and 5 control and potentially prohibit the export of our products 

most of our us government contracts can be terminated by the us government either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the contract termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination termination for default provisions provide for the contractor to be liable for excess costs incurred by the us government in procuring undelivered items from another source 

as described elsewhere in this report five of our divisions and subsidiaries have been subject to a us department of defense or the dod office of inspector general review of our records for the purpose of determining whether the dod’s various buying offices negotiated “fair and reasonable” prices for spare parts purchased from those five divisions and subsidiaries in fiscal years 2002 through 2004 for additional information regarding the details and status of the pricing review please refer to “risk factors—certain of our divisions and subsidiaries have been subject to a pricing review by the dod office of inspector general” 

governmental regulation 

the commercial aircraft component industry is highly regulated by both the faa in the united states and by the joint aviation authorities in europe and other agencies throughout the world while the military aircraft component industry is governed by military quality specifications we and the components we manufacture are required to be certified by one or more of these entities or agencies and in some cases by individual oems in order to engineer and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models 

we must also satisfy the requirements of our customers including oems and airlines that are subject to faa regulations and provide these customers with products and services that comply with the government regulations applicable to commercial flight operations in addition the faa requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components and we believe that we currently satisfy or exceed these maintenance standards in our repair and overhaul services we also maintain several faa approved repair stations 

in addition sales of many of our products that will be used on aircraft owned by nonus entities are subject to compliance with us export control laws 

our operations are also subject to a variety of worker and community safety laws the occupational safety and health act or osha mandates general requirements for safe workplaces for all employees in addition osha provides special procedures and measures for the handling of certain hazardous and toxic substances 

raw materials and patents 

we require the use of various raw materials including titanium aluminum nickel powder nickel screen stainless steel iridium and cadmium in our manufacturing processes we also purchase a variety of manufactured component parts from various suppliers at times we concentrate our orders among a few suppliers in order to strengthen our supplier relationships raw materials and component parts are generally available from multiple suppliers at competitive prices 

we have various trade secrets proprietary information trademarks trade names patents copyrights and other intellectual property rights which we believe in the aggregate but not individually are important to our business 

  

backlog 

as of september 30 2008 we estimated our sales order backlog at 4178 million compared to an estimated 3652 million as of september 30 2007 this increase in backlog is primarily due to the acquisitions of the business of cef industries inc or cef and a product line of unison industries llc “unison” totaling approximately 341 million the majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of september 30 2008 are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months purchase orders may be subject to cancellation by the customer prior to shipment the level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of our receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled accordingly our backlog as of september 30 2008 may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period 

foreign operations 

although we manufacture substantially all of our products in the united states we manufacture some products in malaysia through our whollyowned malaysian subsidiary we sell our products in the united states as well as in foreign countries substantially all of our foreign sales are transacted in us dollars and therefore we have no material exposure to fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the us dollar as a result of foreign sales in addition the amount of components or other raw materials or supplies that we purchase from foreign suppliers including our malaysian manufacturing subsidiary are not material with substantially all such transactions being made in us dollars accordingly we have no material exposure to currency fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the us dollar arising from these transactions 

our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately 1443 million 1430 million and 1027 million for fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks including the impact of foreign government regulations political uncertainties and differences in business practices there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments’ countries furthermore there can be no assurance that the political cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 

environmental matters 

our operations and facilities are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations governing among other matters the emission discharge generation management transportation and disposal of hazardous materials wastes and pollutants the investigation and remediation of contaminated sites and permits required in connection with our operations although management believes that our operations and facilities are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws management cannot provide assurance that future changes in such laws or the regulations or requirements thereunder or in the nature of our operations will not require us to make significant additional expenditures to ensure compliance in the future further we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and sanctions and third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws relevant common law or the environmental permits required for our operations 

under some environmental laws a current or previous owner or operator of a contaminated site may be held liable for the entire cost of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous materials at such property whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials persons who arrange for disposal or treatment of hazardous materials also may be liable for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of those substances at a disposal or treatment site regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by them because we own andor operate a number of facilities that have a history of industrial or commercial use and because we arrange for the disposal of hazardous materials at many disposal sites we may and do incur costs for investigation removal and remediation contaminants have been 

  

detected at some of our present and former sites principally in connection with historical operations and investigations andor cleanups have been undertaken by us or by former owners of the sites we receive inquiries and notices of potential liability with respect to offsite disposal facilities from time to time although we have not incurred any material investigation or cleanup costs to date and investigation and cleanup costs are not expected to be material in the future the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at these or other sites or the failure of any other potentially liable party to meet its obligations could result in significant liability for us 

employees 

as of september 30 2008 we had approximately 2100 employees approximately 5 of our employees were represented by the united steelworkers union approximately 3 were represented by the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america and approximately 4 were represented by the international brotherhood of electrical workers collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire in april 2011 november 2012 and may 2009 respectively we consider our relationship with our employees generally to be satisfactory 

legal proceedings 

we are from time to time subject to and are presently involved in litigation or other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of business based upon information currently known to us we believe the outcome of such proceedings will not have individually or in the aggregate a material adverse effect on our business our financial condition or results of operations

 item 1a risk factors tableend set forth below are important risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business and financial condition and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

our business is sensitive to the number of flight hours that our customers’ planes spend aloft the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and our customers’ profitability these items are in turn affected by general economic conditions 

our business is directly affected by among other factors changes in revenue passenger miles or rpms the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and to a lesser extent changes in the profitability of the commercial airline industry rpms and airline profitability have historically been correlated with the general economic environment although national and international events also play a key role for example in recent years the airline industry has been severely affected by the downturn in the global economy higher fuel prices the increased security concerns among airline customers following the events of september 11 2001 the severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars epidemic and the conflicts in afghanistan and iraq as a result of the substantial reduction in airline traffic resulting from these events the airline industry incurred and some in the industry continue to incur large losses and financial difficulties some carriers have also parked or retired a portion of their fleets and have reduced workforces and flights during periods of reduced airline profitability some airlines may delay purchases of spare parts preferring instead to deplete existing inventories if demand for new aircraft and spare parts decreases there would be a decrease in demand for certain of our products 

future terrorist attacks may have a material adverse impact on our business 

following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks passenger traffic on commercial flights was significantly lower than prior to the attacks and many commercial airlines reduced their operating schedules overall the terrorist attacks resulted in billions of dollars in losses to the airline industry any future acts of terrorism and any military response to such acts could result in further acts of terrorism and additional hostilities including possible retaliatory attacks on sovereign nations as well as financial economic and political instability while the precise effects of any such terrorist attack military response or instability on our industry and our business is difficult to determine it could result in further reductions in the use of commercial aircraft if demand for new aircraft and spare parts decreases demand for certain of our products would also decrease 

our sales to manufacturers of large aircraft are cyclical and a downturn in sales to these manufacturers may adversely affect us 

our sales to manufacturers of large commercial aircraft such as the boeing company airbus sas and related oem suppliers which accounted for approximately 14 of our net sales in fiscal year 2008 have historically experienced periodic downturns in the past these sales have been affected by airline profitability which is impacted by among other things fuel and labor costs price competition downturns in the global economy and national and international events such as the events of september 11 2001 prior downturns have adversely affected our net sales gross margin and net income 

we rely heavily on certain customers for much of our sales 

our two largest customers for fiscal year 2008 were boeing which includes aviall inc a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world and honeywell international inc these two customers accounted for approximately 14 and 10 respectively of our net sales in fiscal year 2008 our top ten customers for fiscal year 2008 accounted for approximately 46 of our net sales a reduction in purchasing by one of our larger customers for any reason such as economic downturn decreased production or strike could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and net income see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—overview” 

  

we generally do not have guaranteed future sales of our products further when we enter into fixed price contracts with some of our customers we take the risk for cost overruns 

as is customary in our business we do not generally have longterm contracts with most of our aftermarket customers and therefore do not have guaranteed future sales although we have longterm contracts with many of our oem customers some of those customers may terminate the contracts on short notice and in many other cases our customers have not committed to buy any minimum quantity of our products in addition in certain cases we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon the historic purchasing patterns of customers and upon our discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements and this anticipated future volume of orders may not materialize 

we also have entered into multiyear fixedprice contracts with some of our customers pursuant to which we have agreed to perform the work for a fixed price and accordingly realize all the benefit or detriment resulting from any decreases or increases in the costs of making these products sometimes we accept a fixedprice contract for a product that we have not yet produced and this increases the risk of cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product most of our contracts do not permit us to recover for increases in raw material prices taxes or labor costs although some contracts provide for renegotiation to address certain material adverse changes 

us military spending is dependent upon the us defense budget 

the us department of defense or the dod budget has generally increased for each fiscal year from fiscal 1997 to the budget for fiscal 2008 and based on the bush administration’s current future year defense program the dod budget is expected to continue to increase modestly through fiscal 2010 however future dod budgets after fiscal 2008 could be negatively impacted by several factors including but not limited to a change in defense spending policy following the 2008 presidential elections the us government’s budget deficits spending priorities the cost of sustaining the us military presence in iraq and afghanistan and possible political pressure to reduce us government military spending each of which could cause the dod budget to remain unchanged or to decline a significant decline in us military expenditures in the future could result in a reduction in the amount of our products sold to the various agencies and buying organizations of the us government 

we intend to pursue future acquisitions our business may be adversely affected if we cannot consummate acquisitions on satisfactory terms or if we cannot effectively integrate acquired operations 

a significant portion of our growth has occurred through acquisitions any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions we intend to pursue acquisitions that we believe will present opportunities consistent with our overall business strategy however we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates to purchase or may be unable to acquire desired businesses or assets on economically acceptable terms in addition we may not be able to raise the capital necessary to fund future acquisitions in addition acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect 

we regularly engage in discussions with respect to potential acquisition and investment opportunities if we consummate an acquisition our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly future acquisitions could likely result in the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest and amortization expenses or periodic impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets as well as significant charges relating to integration costs 

in addition we may not be able to successfully integrate any business we acquire into our existing business the successful integration of new businesses depends on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess 

  

costs the successful integration of future acquisitions may also require substantial attention from our senior management and the management of the acquired business which could decrease the time that they have to service and attract customers and develop new products and services in addition because we may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously we may encounter unforeseen expenses complications and delays including difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight 

we are subject to certain unique business risks as a result of supplying equipment and services to the us government in addition government contracts contain unfavorable termination provisions and are subject to modification and audit 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 

 

  

  

  

 most of our us government contracts can be terminated by the us government either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the contract termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination termination for default provisions provide for the contractor to be liable for excess costs incurred by the us government in procuring undelivered items from another source 

on contracts where the price is based on cost the us government may review our costs and performance as well as our accounting and general business practices based on the results of such audits the us government may adjust our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs in addition under us government purchasing regulations some of our costs including most financing costs amortization of intangible assets portions of research and development costs and certain marketing expenses may not be subject to reimbursement 

in addition to these us government contract risks we are at times required to obtain approval from us government agencies to export our products additionally we are not permitted to export some of our products a determination by the us government that we failed to receive required approvals or licenses could eliminate or restrict our ability to sell our products outside the united states and the penalties that could be imposed by the us government for failure to comply with these laws could be significant 

certain of our divisions and subsidiaries have been subject to a pricing review by the dod office of inspector general 

five of our divisions and subsidiaries have been the subject of a dod office of inspector general review of our records for the purpose of determining whether the dod’s various buying offices negotiated “fair and reasonable” prices for spare parts purchased from those divisions and subsidiaries during fiscal years 2002 through 2004 on april 19 2006 the inspector general issued its final report dated february 23 2006 and made public a redacted version of the report the report recommends i that the defense logistics agency request that those five subsidiaries and divisions voluntarily refund in the aggregate approximately 26 million for allegedly overpriced parts and ii that defense logistics agency contracting officers reevaluate their procedures for determining the reasonableness of pricing for sole source spare parts purchased from those divisions and subsidiaries and seek to develop strategic supplier alliances with those divisions and subsidiaries 

  

our position has been and continues to be that our pricing has been fair and reasonable and that there is no legal basis for the amount suggested as a refund by the inspector general in its report in response to the report we offered reasons why we disagree with the inspector general’s overall analysis and why computations related to the voluntary refund contained in the report fail to consider key data such as actual historical sales if the defense logistics agency requests a voluntary refund from any of our divisions or subsidiaries we would consider such a request under the circumstances existing at that time 

in february 2006 the defense logistics agency made a request to initiate discussions regarding future pricing and developing an acquisition strategy that would mutually strengthen our business relationship with the defense logistics agency around that time the parties discussed future purchasing but did not engage in negotiations regarding strategic supplier alliances negotiations regarding strategic supplier alliances may occur at a later date as a result of those negotiations it is possible that the divisions and subsidiaries subject to the pricing review will enter into strategic supplier alliances with the defense logistics agency it is likely that in connection with any strategic supplier alliance the defense logistics agency will seek prices for parts based on cost it is also possible that the dod may seek alternative sources of supply for such parts the entry into strategic supplier alliances or a decision by the dod to pursue alternative sources of supply for parts we currently provide could reduce the amount of revenue we derive from and the profitability of certain of our supply arrangements with certain agencies and buying organizations for the us government 

our business may be adversely affected if we would lose our government or industry approvals or if more stringent government regulations are enacted or if industry oversight is increased 

the aerospace industry is highly regulated in the united states and in other countries in order to sell our components we and the components we manufacture must be certified by the faa the dod and similar agencies in foreign countries and by individual manufacturers if new and more stringent government regulations are adopted or if industry oversight increases we might incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or heightened industry oversight in addition if material authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended our business would be adversely affected 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and could harm our ability to react to changes to our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness including the notes 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of september 30 2008 our total indebtedness was approximately 13572 million including premium received net of amortization in connection with the issuance of the original notes which was approximately 675 of our total capitalization in addition we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future for example as of september 30 2008 we had 1985 million of unused commitments under our revolving loan facility although the senior secured credit facility or the senior secured credit facility and the indenture or indenture governing the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes or the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these qualifications and exceptions could be substantial if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage would increase 

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to investors for example it could 

 

  

  

   

  

 in addition all of our debt under the senior secured credit facility which includes a 780 million term loan facility and a revolving loan facility of 200 million will bear interest at floating rates accordingly in the event that interest rates increase our debt service expense will also increase in order to reduce the floating interest rate risk the company has entered into interest rate swaps that fix the rate of interest on 450 million of debt as of september 30 2008 under the senior secured credit facility 

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness including the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital 

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make payments on our indebtedness including the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes and amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility and to fund our operations will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future which to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

we cannot assure you however that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness including the amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility and the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes or to fund our other liquidity needs if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital we cannot assure you that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations the terms of existing or future debt instruments the indenture and the senior secured credit facility may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives in addition any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms and would otherwise adversely affect the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes 

the terms of the senior secured credit facility and the indenture may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

the senior secured credit facility and the indenture contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indenture and may limit their ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests the senior secured credit 

  

facility and indenture include covenants restricting among other things the ability of td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indenture to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the indenture if any such default occurs the lenders under the senior secured credit facility and the holders of the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder to be immediately due and payable the lenders under the senior secured credit facility also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings in addition following an event of default under the senior secured credit facility the lenders under that facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which includes our available cash and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes if the debt under the senior secured credit facility or the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt 

we are dependent on our highly trained employees and any work stoppage or difficulty hiring similar employees could adversely affect our business 

because our products are complicated and highly engineered we depend on an educated and trained workforce there is substantial competition for skilled personnel in the aircraft component industry and we could be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled employees we may not be able to fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover or attract and retain qualified personnel 

as of september 30 2008 we had approximately 2100 employees approximately 5 of our employees were represented by the united steelworkers union approximately 3 were represented by the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america and approximately 4 were represented by the international brotherhood of electrical workers collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire in april 2011 november 2012 and may 2009 respectively although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory we cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory renewal of these collective bargaining agreements or that our employee relations will remain stable because we maintain a relatively small inventory of finished goods any work stoppage could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide products to our customers 

  

our business is dependent on the availability of certain components and raw materials from suppliers 

our business is affected by the price and availability of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our components our business therefore could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our suppliers such as the destruction of our suppliers’ facilities or their distribution infrastructure a work stoppage or strike by our suppliers’ employees or the failure of our suppliers to provide materials of the requisite quality or by increased costs of such raw materials or components if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers because we maintain a relatively small inventory of raw materials and component parts our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers or alternative raw materials or component parts the lengthy and expensive faa and oem certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier raw material or component part 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under such environmental laws and regulations 

our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things discharges of pollutants into the air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and the remediation of contamination we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and sanctions andor third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws relevant common law or the environmental permits required for our operations 

pursuant to certain environmental laws a current or previous owner or operator of a contaminated site may be held liable for the entire cost of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous materials at such property whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of any hazardous materials persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials may also be held liable for such costs related to a disposal or treatment site regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by them contaminants have been detected at some of our present and former sites principally in connection with historical operations and investigations andor cleanups have been undertaken by us or by former owners of the sites we also receive inquiries and notices of potential liability with respect to offsite disposal facilities from time to time although we are not aware of any sites for which material obligations exist the discovery of additional contaminants the imposition of additional cleanup obligations or the initiation of suits for personal injury or damages to property or natural resources could result in significant liability 

we have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets which may never generate the returns we expect 

mergers and acquisitions have resulted in significant increases in identifiable intangible assets and goodwill identifiable intangible assets which primarily include trademarks trade names trade secrets license agreements and technology were approximately 3562 million at september 30 2008 representing approximately 158 of our total assets goodwill recognized in accounting for the mergers and acquisitions was approximately 13548 million at september 30 2008 representing approximately 601 of our total assets we may never realize the full value of our identifiable intangible assets and goodwill and to the extent we were to determine that our identifiable intangible assets and our goodwill were impaired within the meaning of applicable accounting regulations we would be required to writeoff the amount of any impairment 

we face significant competition 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry and compete against a number of companies including divisions of larger companies some of which have significantly greater resources than we do and therefore may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can competitors in our product lines are 

  

both us and foreign companies and range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privately held entities we believe that our ability to compete depends on high product performance consistent high quality short leadtime and timely delivery competitive pricing superior customer service and support and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs we may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive 

we could be adversely affected if one of our components causes an aircraft to crash 

our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we have designed manufactured or serviced while we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future products liability claims in the event of product liability claims our insurers may attempt to deny coverage or any coverage we have may not be adequate we also may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost any liability not covered by insurance or for which third party indemnification is not available could result in significant liability to us 

in addition a crash caused by one of our components could damage our reputation for quality products we believe our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting a provider of aircraft components if a crash were to be caused by one of our components or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected 

our stock prices may be volatile and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 

there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities which is unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities these broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the purchase price due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects including possible changes due to the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry and other factors such as fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering which could cause shortterm swings in profit margins or unrelated to our operating performance including market conditions affecting the stock market generally or the stocks of aerospace companies more specifically 

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our share price 

a significant amount of our outstanding stock is held by affiliates and not currently traded in the public market while the sale of these shares into the open market may be limited by applicable regulations the stockholders of these shares are not bound by any contractual obligations not to sell thus our existing stockholders may sell additional shares of common stock into the public markets in addition we may sell additional shares of common stock into the public markets or issue convertible debt securities to raise capital in the future the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public markets or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities to raise capital at a time and price that we deem appropriate 

our principal stockholder and its affiliates will be able to influence matters requiring stockholder approval and could discourage the purchase of our outstanding shares at a premium 

warburg pincus through its control of td group llc is deemed to beneficially own approximately 23 of our outstanding common stock as of october 31 2008 this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of our company and may negatively affect the market price of our common stock these transactions might include proxy contests tender offers mergers or other purchase of common stock that could give you the opportunity to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for shares of our common stock 

  

as a result of warburg pincus’ ownership of td group llc and representation on our board of directors warburg pincus will be able to influence the affairs and actions of our company including matters requiring stockholder approval such as the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions the interest of warburg pincus may differ from the interest of our other stockholders for example warburg pincus could oppose a third party offer to acquire us that you might consider attractive and the third party may not be able or willing to proceed unless warburg pincus supports the offer in addition if our board of directors supports a transaction requiring a vote of stockholders warburg pincus is in a position to affect any required stockholder approval in each of these cases and in similar situations you may disagree with warburg pincus as to whether the action opposed or supported by warburg pincus is in the best interest of our stockholders 

our corporate documents and delaware law contain certain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable for example our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 149600000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock without stockholder approval the board of directors has the authority to attach special rights including voting and dividend rights to this preferred stock with these rights holders of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us in addition our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered board of directors whereby directors serve for threeyear terms with approximately onethird of the directors coming up for reelection each year having a staggered board will make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of our board of directors through a proxy contest which may be a necessary step in an acquisition of us that is not favored by our board of directors our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75 of the voting power of our issued and outstanding capital stock voting together as a single class is required for the alteration amendment or repeal of certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation including the provisions authorizing a staggered board and certain provisions of our amended and restated bylaws including the provisions relating to our stockholders’ ability to call special meetings notice provisions for stockholder business to be conducted at an annual meeting requests for stockholder lists and corporate records nomination and removal of directors and filling of vacancies on our board of directors 

we are also subject to the antitakeover provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law under these provisions if anyone becomes an “interested stockholder” we may not enter into a “business combination” with that person for three years without special approval which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change of control for purposes of section 203 “interested stockholder” means generally someone owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years subject to certain exceptions as described in section 203 td group llc warburg pincus and their affiliates do not constitute “interested stockholders” for the purposes of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law 

we do not intend to pay regular cash dividends on our stock 

we do not anticipate declaring or paying regular cash dividends on our common stock or any other equity security in the foreseeable future the amounts that may be available to us to pay cash dividends are restricted under out debt and other agreements any payment of cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations earnings capital requirements financial condition future prospects contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors therefore you should not rely on dividend income from shares of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected financial data” and td group’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report the following discussion may contain predictions estimates and other forwardlooking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties including those discussed under the heading entitled “risk factors” included elsewhere in this report these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 

overview 

we believe we are a leading global designer producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers some of our more significant product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls ignition systems and components gear pumps specialized valves engineered connectors power conditioning devices specialized fluorescent lighting and acdc electric motors aircraft audio systems engineered latches and cockpit security devices lavatory hardware and components hold open rods and locking devices specialized cockpit displays elastomers and nicad batterieschargers each of these product offerings consists of many individual products that are typically customized to meet the needs of a particular aircraft platform or customer 

for fiscal year 2008 we generated net sales of 7137 million and net income of 1331 million in addition for fiscal year 2008 our ebitda was 3245 million or 455 of net sales our ebitda as defined was 3331 million or 467 of net sales and our capital expenditures were 109 million or 15 of net sales see “ebitda and ebitda as defined” below for certain information regarding ebitda and ebitda as defined including a reconciliation of ebitda and ebitda as defined to net income 

we estimate that over 90 of our net sales for fiscal year 2008 were generated by proprietary products for which we own the design these products are generally approved and certified by airframe manufacturers who often certify only one manufacturer’s component design for a specific application on an aircraft government agencies andor the faa and similar entities or agencies in addition for fiscal year 2008 we estimate that we generated approximately 75 of our net sales from products for which we are the sole source provider 

most of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue once our parts are designed into and sold as original equipment on an aircraft we generate net sales from recurring aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft this installed base and our sole source provider position generate a longterm stream of aftermarket revenues over the estimated 30year life of an individual aircraft we estimate that approximately 60 of our net sales in fiscal year 2008 were generated from aftermarket sales the vast majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets these aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and been more stable than sales to oems 

in fiscal year 2008 our top two customers accounted for approximately 24 of our net sales and during this same period our top ten customers accounted for approximately 46 of our net sales however our components are ultimately used on a large diverse installed base of aircraft and therefore we are not overly dependent on any single airframe produced by any of our customers or other ultimate endusers of our products in the commercial aerospace sector which generated approximately 70 of our net sales for fiscal year 2008 we sell to distributors of aftermarket components as well as directly to commercial airlines aircraft maintenance facilities systems suppliers and aircraft and engine oems in addition for fiscal year 2008 approximately 27 of our net sales were attributable to the defense aerospace sector net sales to the defense sector are generated primarily through sales to the united states and foreign militaries brokers distributors and defense oems the 

  

remaining portion of our net sales in fiscal year 2008 or approximately 3 of our net sales during this period were derived from industries with similar niche engineered product characteristics such as the mining and power generation industries

trend information 

we predominantly serve customers in the commercial aerospace oem market which accounts for approximately 29 of total sales and includes large commercial transport manufacturers and regional business jet manufacturers the commercial regional business jet and general aviation aftermarket which accounts for approximately 42 of total sales and the defense market which accounts for approximately 26 of total sales nonaerospace sales comprise approximately 3 of our total sales 

the commercial aerospace industry including the oem market and aftermarket is impacted by the health of the global economy and geopolitical events around the world although the commercial aerospace industry had shown strength with increases in revenue passenger miles or rpms between 2003 and the first half of 2008 as well as increases in oem production and backlog rising fuel prices the global economic downturn airline capacity reductions and concerns over the financial credit markets have negatively impacted the commercial aerospace industry the defense aerospace market is dependent on government budget constraints the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts it is not necessarily affected by general economic conditions that affect the commercial aerospace industry 

our presence in both the commercial aerospace and military sectors of the aerospace industry may mitigate the impact on our business of any specific industry risk we service a diversified customer base in the commercial and military aerospace industry and we provide components to a diverse installed base of aircraft which mitigates our exposure to any individual airframe platform at times declines in sales in one sector have been offset by increased sales in another however due to differences between the profitability of our products sold to oem and aftermarket customers variation in product mix can cause variation in gross margin 

there are many shortterm factors including inventory corrections unannounced changes in order patterns strikes and mergers and acquisitions that can cause shortterm disruptions in our quarterly shipment patterns as compared to previous quarters and the same periods in prior years to normalize for shortterm fluctuations we tend to look at our performance over several quarters or years of activity rather than discreet shortterm periods as such it can be difficult to determine longerterm trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons 

there are also fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering and delivery requests from quartertoquarter as well as variations in product mix from quartertoquarter that may cause positive or negative variations in 

  

gross profit margins since commercial aftermarket sales have historically produced a higher gross margin than sales to commercial oems again in many instances these are timing events between quarters and must be balanced with macro aerospace industry indicators 

commercial oem market 

there is industry consensus that aircraft deliveries in the large commercial transport market sector aircraft with 100 or more seats may reach its peak in 2009 and that deliveries may be flat or decrease going forward another indicator of future oem sales in this market is the order backlog at the boeing company and airbus sas despite a significant number of airplanes in the backlog current year orders for new airplanes has decreased from the prior year and the availability of financing is uncertain due to the current state of the credit markets indicating that 2009 oem production may be somewhat lower than originally anticipated in addition although the labor strike at boeing has concluded we believe we will lose two to three months of effective production in our fiscal 2009 commercial oem sales from the strike furthermore the business jet oem market may also peak in 2009 and decrease thereafter this market similarly appears to have been negatively impacted by a slowdown in economic growth corporate profits commodity prices and stock market returns across the world and we may see corresponding reductions in 2009 production 

commercial aftermarket 

the key growth factors in the commercial aftermarket include worldwide rpms and the size and activity level of the worldwide fleet of aircraft although rpms increased annually between 2003 and the first half of 2008 industry consensus indicates that 2009 may show flat to modest negative growth as a result of expected reductions in air traffic and capacity due to the increasing cost of fuel and the slowdown in the global economy industry reports expect rpms to stabilize in 2010 and return to positive growth thereafter 

defense 

in recent years defense spending has reached historic highs due in part to the military engagements in afghanistan and iraq and the war on terrorism our military business fluctuates from year to year and is dependent to a degree on government budget constraints the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts we anticipate that military related sales of our types of products will experience modest growth in 2009 over the current high levels 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations however investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 

we have identified the following as the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial status depends these critical policies were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments our most critical accounting policies are as follows 

revenue recognition and related allowances substantially all of our revenues are recognized based upon shipment of products to the customer at which time title and risk of loss passes to the customer substantially all sales are made pursuant to firm fixedprice purchase orders received from customers provisions for returns uncollectible accounts and the cost of repairs under contract warranty provisions are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are principally based on historical results modified as appropriate by the most current information available we have a history of making reasonably dependable 

  

estimates of such allowances however due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process it is possible that actual results may vary from the estimates and the differences could be material 

management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable and customer creditworthiness the allowance also incorporates a provision for the estimated impact of disputes with customers management’s estimate of the allowance amounts that are necessary includes amounts for specifically identified losses and a general amount for estimated losses based on historical information the determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to significant levels of judgment and estimation by management if circumstances change or economic conditions deteriorate management may need to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company provides limited warranties in connection with the sale of its products the warranty period for products sold varies throughout the company’s operations ranging from 90 days to six years in addition certain contracts with distributors contain right of return provisions the company accrues for estimated returns and warranty claims based on knowledge of product performance issues and excess inventories provided by its customers and industry sources the company also provides a general amount based on historical results historically actual product returns and warranty claims have not differed materially from the estimates originally established 

inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost of inventories is determined by the average cost and the firstin firstout fifo methods for all locations except cef which determines the cost of inventories using the lastin firstout lifo method because the company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be inservice for 30 or more years it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use provision for potentially obsolete or slowmoving inventory is made based on our analysis of inventory levels past usage and future sales forecasts although management believes that the company’s estimates of obsolete and slowmoving inventory are reasonable actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future in addition in accordance with industry practice all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year 

intangible assets mergers and acquisitions have resulted in significant amounts of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights or if the intangible asset can be sold transferred licensed or exchanged regardless of the company’s intent to do so goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and under financial accounting standards board statement no 142 “ goodwill and other intangible assets ” “sfas 142” are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates the determination of undiscounted cash flows is based on the company’s strategic plans and longrange planning forecasts the revenue growth rates included in the plans are based on industry and company specific data the profit margin assumptions included in the plans are projected based on the current cost structure and anticipated cost changes if different assumptions were used in these plans the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different and the recognition of an impairment loss might be required intangible assets such as goodwill trademarks and trade names that have an indefinite useful life are not amortized all other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 

stock options and deferred compensation plans the company accounts for the cost of its stock options under the provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment”  which requires the measurement of compensation expense under the stock option plan to be based on the fair value of the awards under the plan on the grant dates and amortizes the expense over the options’ vesting periods in addition the company accounts for the cost of the deferred compensation plans of td group in accordance with opinion no 12 of the accounting principles board which requires the cost of deferred compensation arrangements to be accrued over the service period of the related employees in a systematic and rational manner 

  

purchase accounting our mergers and acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method accordingly fair value adjustments to the company’s assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in its consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition we generally use thirdparty appraisals to assist us in determining the fair value adjustments 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain operating data of the company including presentation of the amounts as a percentage of net sales amounts in thousands 

 

 fiscal year ended september 30 2008 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2007

cost of sales  cost of sales increased by 440 million or 155 to 3278 million for fiscal year 2008 from 2838 from fiscal year 2007 cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased to 459 for fiscal year 2008 from 479 for fiscal year 2007 the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to increased volume associated with the higher net sales of 1209 million discussed above partially offset by a 61 million decrease or 1 of net sales in acquisitionrelated costs the decrease in acquisitionrelated expenses was primarily due to inventory purchase accounting charges and integration costs recorded in the prior year of 84 million related to the acquisitions of ati and cda partially offset by current year inventory purchase accounting charges and integration costs of 23 million primarily related to the acquisitions of bruce and cef 

the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was primarily due a decrease from acquisitionrelated costs discussed above the strength of the company’s proprietary products and continued productivity efforts partially offset by the impact from the acquisitions of ati bruce and cef 

selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased by 118 million or 187 to 747 million for fiscal year 2008 from 629 million for fiscal year 2007 this increase was primarily 

  

due to the higher sales discussed above and an increase in research and development expenses of 35 million primarily relating to the boeing 787 program partially offset by the nonrecurring charge of 17 million relating to the secondary offering recorded in the prior year 

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles decreased by 03 million to 120 million for fiscal year 2008 from 123 million for fiscal year 2007 

income from operations operating income increased by 654 million or 280 to 2992 million for fiscal year 2008 from 2338 million for fiscal year 2007 primarily due to higher sales and other factors described above 

interest expense  interest expense increased 09 million or 10 to 927 million for fiscal year 2008 from 918 million for fiscal year 2007 due to an increase in our debt of approximately 430 million from the acquisition ati in february 2007 partially offset by lower interest rates and higher interest income of 23 million the company’s weighted average level of outstanding borrowings was approximately 136 billion during fiscal 2008 compared to approximately 120 billion during the comparable period last year while the average interest rate decreased to approximately 69 during fiscal 2008 from 76 for the comparable period last year see “liquidity and capital resources” below 

income taxes  income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately 356 for fiscal year 2008 compared to 376 for fiscal year 2007 the lower effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in state and local taxes an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction and the favorable resolution of a prior year irs audit and state tax refund of 12 million partially offset by a lower research and development tax credit 

net income net income increased 445 million or 502 to 1331 million for fiscal year 2008 compared to 886 million for fiscal year 2007 primarily as a result of the factors referred to above 

fiscal year ended september 30 2007 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2006 

net sales net sales increased by 1576 million or 362 to 5928 million for fiscal year 2007 from 4352 million for fiscal year 2006 sales growth excluding acquisitions was 615 million and represented a 141 increase over the prior year the organic sales growth was primarily due to i an increase of 349 million of commercial aftermarket sales resulting from the strong underlying demand in the worldwide commercial aerospace market and the strength of our proprietary products and market position ii an increase of 143 million of commercial oem sales primarily resulting from the increase in the business jet market and iii an increase of 118 million of military sales the remaining 961 million increase resulted from the acquisitions of the businesses of cda ati and bruce industries in fiscal 2007 and businesses of electramotion and sweeney in fiscal 2006 

cost of sales  cost of sales increased by 699 million or 327 to 2838 million for fiscal year 2007 from 2139 from fiscal year 2006 cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased approximately 12 percentage points to 479 for fiscal year 2007 from 491 for fiscal year 2006 the absolute dollar increase in cost of sales was primarily due to increased volume associated with the higher net sales of 1576 million discussed above a 64 million charge or 11 of net sales that resulted from inventory purchase price accounting charges pertaining to the acquisitions of the businesses of cda ati and bruce industries and an increase in acquisition integration costs of approximately 10 million relating to recent acquisitions the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was primarily due to favorable product mix on the increase in commercial aftermarket sales productivity improvements and to a lesser extent favorable fixed cost leverage on greater volume 

selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased by 146 million or 302 to 629 million for fiscal year 2007 from 483 million for fiscal year 2006 the prior year period included nonrecurring costs of 62 million for a onetime special bonus and 27 million of costs associated 

  

with the initial public offering these prior year costs were partially offset by a 38 million reversal of charges resulting from the termination of two deferred compensation plans in fiscal 2006 the net reduction of prior year non operating activity of approximately 51 million or 12 of prior year net sales was partially offset by an increase in selling and administrative costs associated with higher sales volume discussed above higher research and development costs of 58 million or 10 of net sales relating to the boeing 787 and other new programs and 17 million or 03 of net sales of costs associated with the secondary offering 

selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 106 for fiscal year 2007 from 111 for the comparable period last year primarily due to the factors described above 

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles increased by 61 million to 123 million for fiscal year 2007 from 62 million for fiscal year 2006 the increase was primarily due to the additional identifiable intangible assets recognized in connection with the acquisitions of the businesses of cda ati and bruce industries of which 36 million related to order backlog amortization that is typically amortized over 12 months 

refinancing costs refinancing costs represented a onetime charge that was recorded in june 2006 as a result of the refinancing of transdigm’s entire debt structure the charge of 486 million consisted of the premium of 256 million paid to redeem our 8 3  8  senior subordinated notes and the writeoff of 229 million of debt issue costs associated with our former senior credit facility our 8 3  8  senior subordinated notes and the td group loan facility and other expenses of 01 million 

income from operations operating income increased by 1156 million or 979 to 2338 million for fiscal year 2007 from 1182 million for fiscal year 2006 primarily due to higher sales the refinancing costs of 486 million recorded in fiscal 2006 and other factors described above 

interest expense  interest expense increased 151 million or 196 to 918 million for fiscal year 2007 from 767 million for fiscal year 2006 the net increase was primarily the result of an increase of our outstanding borrowings of approximately 430 million related to the acquisition of ati in february 2007 partially offset by lower interest rates from the refinancing of our debt structure during june 2006 the company’s weighted average level of outstanding borrowings increased to approximately 12 billion during fiscal 2007 from approximately 904 million during fiscal 2006 while the average interest rate decreased to 76 during fiscal 2007 from 82 during fiscal 2006 

income taxes  income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately 376 for fiscal year 2007 compared to 394 for fiscal year 2006 the lower effective tax rate was primarily due to lower state and local taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes and a decrease in nondeductible public offering expenses these reductions were partially offset by an income tax benefit of 15 million or 38 of the income before income taxes recorded in fiscal 2006 resulting from the adoption of a change in texas tax law enacted in may 2006 

net income net income increased 635 million or 253 to 886 million for fiscal year 2007 compared to 251 million for fiscal year 2006 primarily as a result of the refinancing in fiscal 2006 and other factors referred to above 

backlog 

as of september 30 2008 the company estimated its sales order backlog at 4178 million compared to an estimated sales order backlog of 3652 million as of september 30 2007 this increase in backlog of 526 million is primarily due to the acquisitions of the businesses of cef and unison discussed above totaling approximately 341 million the majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of september 30 2008 are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months purchase orders may be subject to cancellation by the 

  

customer prior to shipment the level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of the company’s receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled accordingly the company’s backlog as of september 30 2008 may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period 

foreign operations 

although we manufacture substantially all of our products in the united states we manufacture some products in malaysia through our whollyowned malaysian subsidiary we sell our products in the united states as well as in foreign countries substantially all of our foreign sales are transacted in us dollars and therefore we have no material exposure to fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the us dollar as a result of foreign sales in addition the amount of components or other raw materials or supplies that we purchase from foreign suppliers including our malaysian manufacturing subsidiary are not material with substantially all such transactions being made in us dollars accordingly we have no material exposure to currency fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the us dollar arising from these transactions 

our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately 1443 million 1430 million and 1027 million for fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks including the impact of foreign government regulations political uncertainties and differences in business practices there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments’ countries furthermore there can be no assurance that the political cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 

inflation 

many of the company’s raw materials and operating expenses are sensitive to the effects of inflation which could result in changing operating costs the effects of inflation on the company’s businesses during the fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 were not significant 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating activities the company generated 1896 million of cash from operating activities during fiscal 2008 compared to 1124 million generated during fiscal 2007 the increase of 772 million in fiscal 2008 is primarily due to an increase in net income of 445 million and favorable changes in accounts receivable and inventory of approximately 310 million 

we generated 1124 million of cash from operating activities during fiscal 2007 compared to 31 million generated during fiscal 2006 the increase of 1093 million is primarily due to i the absence in 2007 of the 627 million of interest paid in fiscal 2006 relating to the 12 senior unsecured promissory notes ii the absence in 2007 of the distributions to participants in our deferred compensation plans totaling approximately 260 million in november 2005 in connection with the distributions under the deferred compensation plans our board of directors approved the termination of the plans during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 iii the absence in 2007 of the payment in november 2005 of a onetime special bonus to certain members of management of 62 million and iv the increase in operating cash flows from higher sales and other factors 

investing activities cash used in investing activities decreased to 1650 million during fiscal 2008 consisting of the acquisitions of the businesses of cef for 848 million and unison for 693 million discussed above and capital expenditures of 109 million cash used in investing activities was 5217 million during fiscal 2007 consisting of the acquisitions of the businesses of ati cda and bruce industries for a total of 5114 million discussed above and capital expenditures of 103 million cash used in investing activities was 353 million during fiscal 2006 consisting of the acquisitions of the businesses of sweeney and electramotion for 270 million and capital expenditures of 83 million 

  

financing activities cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2008 was 285 million compared to cash generated in financing activities of 4540 million in fiscal 2007 the cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2008 related to the exercise of stock options 

cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2007 was 4540 million compared to cash used in financing activities of 107 million in fiscal 2006 the cash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2007 consisted of the proceeds received of 2965 million net of fees from the issuance of additional 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes and additional term loans of 1254 million net of fees to finance the acquisition of ati and 321 million related to the exercise of stock options 

the cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2006 of 107 million was primarily due to i the use of 59 million associated with the refinancing in june 2006 and ii the repayment of the unsecured promissory notes of 2000 million the cash used in these financing activities in june 2006 was partially offset by the proceeds from td group loan facility of 1938 million and 14 million related to the exercise of stock options 

description of current senior secured credit facility and indenture 

in june 2006 transdigm refinanced its entire debt structure in connection with the refinancing transdigm inc obtained a new senior secured credit facility the “senior secured credit facility” the senior secured credit facility consisted of a 650 million term loan facility which was fully drawn at closing and a 150 million revolving loan facility in addition under the terms of the senior secured credit facility transdigm inc had the right to request but no lender was committed to provide additional term loans of up to 250 million subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions including pro forma compliance with the financial covenant contained in the senior secured credit facility after giving effect to any such incremental term loan borrowings 

in connection with the acquisition of ati in february 2007 transdigm inc entered into an amendment of the senior secured credit facility which provided for among other things i an additional term loan of 130 million ii a 50 million increase in the revolving credit facility bringing the total available revolver to 200 million and iii a 50 million increase in the uncommitted incremental loan facility to 300 million at september 30 2008 1985 million of the revolving credit facility was available 

the term loan facility including the additional borrowings in february 2007 will mature in june 2013 and will not be subject to interim scheduled amortization but will be subject to certain prepayment requirements under the amended terms of the senior secured credit facility commencing 90 days after the end of fiscal 2008 and each fiscal year thereafter transdigm inc is required to prepay outstanding term loans in a principal amount equal to 50 of excess cash flow as defined provided that the amount of the prepayment will be reduced to 25 of excess cash flow if the consolidated leverage ratio as defined at the end of the applicable fiscal year is less than 500 to 100 but greater than 450 to 100 and transdigm inc will not be required to prepay any of the term loan of the consolidated leverage ratio as of the end of the applicable fiscal year is equal to or less than 450 to 100 or if the term loan achieves certain minimum credit ratings at the end of such fiscal year transdigm’s consolidated leverage ratio is less than 450 to 100 at september 30 2008 thus the company is not obligated to make the prepayment of the term loans based upon the excess cash flow provision

contractual obligations 

the following is a summary of contractual cash obligations as of september 30 2008 in millions 

 

  

  in addition to the contractual obligations set forth above the company incurs capital expenditures for the purpose of maintaining and replacing existing equipment and facilities and from time to time for facility expansion capital expenditures totaled approximately 109 million 103 million and 83 million during fiscal 2008 2007 and fiscal 2006 respectively the company expects its capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 to be between 15 million to 20 million and such expenditures are projected to increase moderately thereafter 

the company intends to pursue acquisitions that present opportunities consistent with the company’s business direction the company regularly engages in discussions with respect to potential acquisitions and investments however there can be no assurance that the company will be able to consummate an agreement with respect to any future acquisition the company’s acquisition strategy may require substantial capital and no assurance can be given that the company will be able to raise any necessary funds on acceptable terms or at all if the company incurs additional debt to finance acquisitions total interest expense will increase 

if the company has excess cash it may consider methods by which it can provide cash to its debt or equity holders through a dividend prepayment of indebtedness repurchase of stock or other means in october 2008 the company announced that its board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million in the aggregate of the company’s common stock whether the company undertakes a stock repurchase or other 

  

aforementioned activities will depend on prevailing market conditions the company’s liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material in addition the company may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so 

the company’s ability to make scheduled interest payments on or to refinance the company’s indebtedness or to fund nonacquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on the company’s ability to generate cash in the future this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control based on its current levels of operations and anticipated cost savings and operating improvements and absent any disruptive events management believes that internally generated funds and borrowings available under our revolving loan facility should provide sufficient resources to finance its operations nonacquisition related capital expenditures research and development efforts and longterm indebtedness obligations through at least fiscal 2009 there can be no assurance however that the company’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all or that future borrowings will be available to the company under the senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its indebtedness or to fund its other liquidity needs the company may need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness on or before maturity also to the extent the company accelerates its growth plans consummates acquisitions or has lower than anticipated sales or increases in expenses the company may also need to raise additional capital in particular increased working capital needs occur whenever the company consummates acquisitions or experiences strong incremental demand there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

 item 1 business tableend the company 

transdigm inc was formed in july 1993 in connection with the acquisition of certain companies from imo industries inc transdigm group incorporated formerly known as td holding corporation or td group was formed in july 2003 at the direction of warburg pincus private equity viii lp or warburg pincus to facilitate the acquisition of transdigm inc or the warburg merger 

on march 20 2006 certain stockholders of td group and certain members of our management sold an aggregate of approximately 126 million shares of td group common stock in an underwritten initial public offering or the initial public offering at a price of 2100 per share td group did not offer any shares of common stock for sale in the initial public offering and td group did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders as a result of the initial public offering td group’s common stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “tdg” 

on may 25 2007 certain of td group’s stockholders including certain members of our management sold an aggregate of 115 million shares of td group’s common stock in an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of 3525 per share as a result of this offering td group is no longer a “controlled company” for the purposes of the nyse listing requirements td group did not sell any shares in the offering and did not receive any proceeds from the offering 

we believe we are a leading global designer producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers some of our more significant product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include ignition systems and components mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls gear pumps engineered connectors specialized valving power conditioning devices engineered latches and cockpit security devices specialized acdc electric motors lavatory hardware and components holdopen rods and locking devices aircraft audio systems nicad batterieschargers and specialized fluorescent lighting and cockpit displays each of these product offerings consists of many individual products that are typically customized to meet the needs of a particular aircraft platform or customer 

we estimate that over 90 of our net sales for fiscal year 2007 were generated by proprietary products for which we own the design in addition for fiscal year 2007 we estimate that we generated approximately 75 of our net sales from products for which we are the sole source provider 

most of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue once our parts are designed into and sold as original equipment on an aircraft we generate net sales from recurring aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft which is generally estimated to be approximately 30 years we estimate that approximately 60 of our net sales in fiscal year 2007 were generated from aftermarket sales the vast majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets these aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and been more stable than sales to original equipment manufacturers or oems 

products 

we primarily design produce and supply highlyengineered proprietary aerospace components and limited systemsubsystems with significant aftermarket content we seek to develop highly customized products to solve specific needs for aircraft operators and manufacturers we attempt to differentiate ourselves based on engineering service and manufacturing capabilities we typically choose not to compete for nonproprietary “build to print” business because it frequently offers lower margins than proprietary products we believe that our products have strong brand names within the industry and that we have a reputation for high quality reliability and customer support 

  

our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products that we offer to our customers some of our more significant product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include 1 ignition systems and components such as igniters exciters and spark plugs used to start and spark turbine and reciprocating aircraft engines 2 mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls used in numerous actuation applications 3 gear pumps used primarily in lubrication and fuel applications 4 engineered connectors used in fuel pneumatic and hydraulic applications 5 specialized valving used in fuel hydraulic and pneumatic applications 6 power conditioning devices used to modify and control electrical power 7 engineered latching and locking devices used in various bin security and other applications 8 specialized acdc electric motors and components used in various defense and commercial applications 9 lavatory hardware and components 10 rods and locking devices used primarily to hold open cowlings to allow access to engines for maintenance 11 aircraft audio systems 12 nicad batterieschargers used to provide starting and backup power 13 specialized fluorescent lighting and 14 specialized cockpit displays 

sales and marketing 

consistent with our overall strategy our sales and marketing organization is structured to continually develop technical solutions that meet customer needs in particular we attempt to focus on products and programs that will lead to highmargin repeatable sales in the aftermarket 

we have structured our sales efforts along our major product offerings assigning a product manager to certain products each product manager is expected to grow the sales and profitability of the products for which he is responsible and to achieve the targeted annual level of bookings sales new business and profitability for such products the product managers are assisted by account managers and sales engineers who are responsible for covering major oem and aftermarket accounts account managers and sales engineers are expected to be familiar with the personnel organization and needs of specific customers to achieve total bookings and new business goals at each account and together with the product managers to determine when additional resources are required at customer locations most of our sales personnel are compensated in part on their bookings and their ability to identify and obtain new business opportunities 

though typically performed by employees the account manager function may be performed by independent representatives depending on the specific customer product and geographic location we also use a number of distributors to provide logistical support as well as primary customer contact with certain smaller accounts our major distributors are aviall inc a subsidiary of the boeing company and satair as 

manufacturing and engineering 

we maintain eleven principal manufacturing facilities each manufacturing facility comprises manufacturing distribution and engineering as well as administrative functions including management sales and finance we continually strive to improve productivity and reduce costs including rationalization of operations developing improved control systems that allow for accurate product profit and loss accounting investing in equipment tooling and information systems and implementing broadbased employee training programs management believes that our manufacturing systems and equipment contribute to our ability to compete by permitting us to meet the rigorous tolerances and cost sensitive price structure of aircraft component customers 

we attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by producing uniquely engineered products with high quality and timely delivery our engineering costs are recorded in cost of sales and in selling and administrative captions in our statements of income total engineering expense represents approximately 8 to 9 of our operating units’ costs or approximately 4 to 5 of our net sales our proprietary products are designed by our engineering staff and are intended to serve the needs of the aircraft component industry particularly through our new product initiatives these proprietary designs must withstand the extraordinary conditions and stresses that will be endured by products during use and meet the rigorous demands of our customers tolerance and quality requirements 

  

we use sophisticated equipment and procedures to attempt to ensure the quality of our products and comply with military specifications and federal aviation administration or faa and oem certification requirements we perform a variety of testing procedures including testing under different temperature humidity and altitude levels shock and vibration testing and xray fluorescent measurement these procedures together with other customer approved techniques for document process and quality control are used throughout our manufacturing facilities 

customers 

our customers include 1 distributors of aerospace components 2 worldwide commercial airlines including national and regional airlines 3 large commercial transport and regional and business aircraft oems 4 various armed forces of the united states and friendly foreign governments 5 defense oems 6 system suppliers and 7 various other industrial customers for the year ended september 30 2007 boeing which includes aviall inc a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world accounted for approximately 16 of our net sales and honeywell international inc accounted for approximately 11 of our net sales products supplied to many of our customers including the two largest customers are used on multiple platforms 

active commercial production programs include the boeing 737 747 767 and 777 the airbus a300 a3192021 and a330a340 the bombardier crj’s and challenger the embraer rj’s the cessna citation family the raytheon premier and hawker and most gulfstream airframes military platforms include aircraft such as the boeing c17 f15 and f18 the lockheed martin c130j and f16 the northrop grumman e2c hawkeye the joint strikefighter and the blackhawk chinook and apache helicopters transdigm has been awarded numerous contracts to develop engineered products for production on the boeing 787 and airbus a380 and a400m programs 

we believe that we have strong customer relationships with almost all large commercial transport regional general aviation and military oems the demand for our aftermarket parts and services depends on among other things the breadth of our installed oem base revenue passenger miles or rpms the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and to a lesser extent airline profitability we believe that we are also a leading supplier of components used on us designed military aircraft including components that are used on a variety of fighter aircraft military freighters and military helicopters 

competition 

the niche markets within the aerospace industry that we serve are relatively fragmented and we face several competitors for many of the products and services we provide due to the global nature of the commercial aircraft industry competition in these categories comes from both us and foreign companies competitors in our product offerings range in size from divisions of large public corporations which have significantly greater financial technological and marketing resources than we do to small privatelyheld entities with only one or two components in their entire product portfolios 

we compete on the basis of engineering manufacturing and marketing high quality products which we believe meet or exceed the performance and maintenance requirements of our customers consistent and timely delivery and superior customer service and support the industrys stringent regulatory certification and technical requirements and the investments necessary in the development and certification of products create barriers to entry for potential new competitors so long as customers receive products that meet or exceed expectations and performance standards we believe that they will have a reduced incentive to certify another supplier because of the cost and time of the technical design and testing certification process in addition we believe that concerns about safety and flight delays if products are unavailable or undependable make our customers continue longterm supplier relationships 

  

government contracts 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 1 suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations 2 terminate existing contracts 3 reduce the value of existing contracts 4 audit our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs and 5 control and potentially prohibit the export of our products 

most of our us government contracts can be terminated by the us government either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the contract termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination termination for default provisions provide for the contractor to be liable for excess costs incurred by the us government in procuring undelivered items from another source 

as described elsewhere in this report five of our divisions and subsidiaries have been subject to a dod office of inspector general review of our records for the purpose of determining whether the dod’s various buying offices negotiated “fair and reasonable” prices for spare parts purchased from those five divisions and subsidiaries in fiscal years 2002 through 2004 for additional information regarding the details and status of the pricing review please refer to “risk factors—certain of our divisions and subsidiaries have been subject to a pricing review by the dod office of inspector general” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—government pricing review” 

governmental regulation 

the commercial aircraft component industry is highly regulated by both the faa in the united states and by the joint aviation authorities in europe and other agencies throughout the world while the military aircraft component industry is governed by military quality specifications we and the components we manufacture are required to be certified by one or more of these entities or agencies and in some cases by individual oems in order to engineer and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models 

we must also satisfy the requirements of our customers including oems and airlines that are subject to faa regulations and provide these customers with products and services that comply with the government regulations applicable to commercial flight operations in addition the faa requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components and we believe that we currently satisfy or exceed these maintenance standards in our repair and overhaul services we also maintain several faa approved repair stations 

in addition sales of many of our products that will be used on aircraft owned by nonus entities are subject to compliance with us export control laws 

our operations are also subject to a variety of worker and community safety laws the occupational safety and health act or osha mandates general requirements for safe workplaces for all employees in addition osha provides special procedures and measures for the handling of certain hazardous and toxic substances 

raw materials and patents 

we require the use of various raw materials including titanium aluminum nickel powder nickel screen stainless steel iridium and cadmium in our manufacturing processes we also purchase a variety of manufactured component parts from various suppliers at times we concentrate our orders among a few suppliers in order to strengthen our supplier relationships raw materials and component parts are generally available from multiple suppliers at competitive prices 

  

we have various trade secrets proprietary information trademarks trade names patents copyrights and other intellectual property rights which we believe in the aggregate but not individually are important to our business 

backlog 

as of september 30 2007 we estimated our sales order backlog at 3652 million compared to an estimated 2513 million as of september 30 2006 this increase in backlog is due to the acquisitions of the businesses of cda intercorp or cda aviation technologies inc or ati and bruce industries inc or bruce industries totaling approximately 660 million and an increase in orders across existing product lines in both the oem and aftermarket segments the majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of september 30 2007 are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months purchase orders may be subject to cancellation by the customer prior to shipment the level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of our receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled accordingly our backlog as of september 30 2007 may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period 

foreign operations 

we manufacture substantially all of our products in the united states however as a result of our ati acquisition some of our products are manufactured in malaysia we sell our products in the united states as well as in foreign countries substantially all of our foreign sales are transacted in us dollars and therefore we have no material exposure to fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the us dollar as a result of foreign sales in addition the amount of components or other raw materials or supplies that we purchase from foreign suppliers including our malaysian manufacturing subsidiary are not material with substantially all such transactions being made in us dollars accordingly we have no material exposure to currency fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the us dollar arising from these transactions 

our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately 1430 million 1027 million and 815 million for fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks including the impact of foreign government regulations political uncertainties and differences in business practices there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments’ countries furthermore there can be no assurance that the political cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 

environmental matters 

our operations and facilities are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations governing among other matters the emission discharge generation management transportation and disposal of hazardous materials wastes and pollutants the investigation and remediation of contaminated sites and permits required in connection with our operations although management believes that our operations and facilities are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws management cannot provide assurance that future changes in such laws or the regulations or requirements thereunder or in the nature of our operations will not require us to make significant additional expenditures to ensure compliance in the future further we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and sanctions and third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws relevant common law or the environmental permits required for our operations 

under some environmental laws a current or previous owner or operator of a contaminated site may be held liable for the entire cost of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous materials at such property whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials 

  

persons who arrange for disposal or treatment of hazardous materials also may be liable for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of those substances at a disposal or treatment site regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by them because we own andor operate a number of facilities that have a history of industrial or commercial use and because we arrange for the disposal of hazardous materials at many disposal sites we may and do incur costs for investigation removal and remediation contaminants have been detected at some of our present and former sites principally in connection with historical operations and investigations andor cleanups have been undertaken by us or by former owners of the sites we receive inquiries and notices of potential liability with respect to offsite disposal facilities from time to time although we have not incurred any material investigation or cleanup costs to date and investigation and cleanup costs are not expected to be material in the future the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at these or other sites or the failure of any other potentially liable party to meet its obligations could result in significant liability for us 

employees 

as of september 30 2007 we had approximately 2100 employees approximately 5 of our employees were represented by the united steelworkers union approximately 4 were represented by the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america and approximately 4 were represented by the international brotherhood of electrical workers collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire in april 2008 november 2008 and may 2009 respectively we consider our relationship with our employees generally to be satisfactory 

legal proceedings 

we are from time to time subject to and are presently involved in litigation or other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of business based upon information currently known to us we believe the outcome of such proceedings will not have individually or in the aggregate a material adverse effect on our business our financial condition or results of operations

td group’s annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q and current reports on form 8k including any amendments will be made available free of charge on the company’s website wwwtransdigmcom  as soon as reasonably practicable following the filing of the reports with the securities and exchange commission 

  

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend set forth below are important risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business and financial condition and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

future terrorist attacks may have a material adverse impact on our business 

following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks passenger traffic on commercial flights was significantly lower than prior to the attacks and many commercial airlines reduced their operating schedules overall the terrorist attacks resulted in billions of dollars in losses to the airline industry any future acts of terrorism and any military response to such acts could result in further acts of terrorism and additional hostilities including possible retaliatory attacks on sovereign nations as well as financial economic and political instability while the precise effects of any such terrorist attack military response or instability on our industry and our business is difficult to determine it could result in further reductions in the use of commercial aircraft if demand for new aircraft and spare parts decreases demand for certain of our products would also decrease 

our business is sensitive to the number of flight hours that our customers’ planes spend aloft the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and our customers’ profitability these items are in turn affected by general economic conditions 

our business is directly affected by among other factors changes in revenue passenger miles or rpms the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and to a lesser extent changes in the profitability of the commercial airline industry rpms and airline profitability have historically been correlated with the general economic environment although national and international events also play a key role for example rpms declined primarily as a result of increased security concerns among airline customers following the events of september 11 2001 in addition to the events of september 11 2001 in recent years the airline industry has been severely affected by the downturn in the global economy higher fuel prices the severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars epidemic and the conflicts in afghanistan and iraq as a result of the substantial reduction in airline traffic resulting from these events the airline industry incurred and some in the industry continue to incur large losses and financial difficulties some carriers have also parked or retired a portion of their fleets and have reduced workforces and flights during periods of reduced airline profitability some airlines may delay purchases of spare parts preferring instead to deplete existing inventories if demand for new aircraft and spare parts decreases there would be a decrease in demand for certain of our products 

our sales to manufacturers of large aircraft are cyclical and a downturn in sales to these manufacturers may adversely affect us 

our sales to manufacturers of large commercial aircraft which accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales in fiscal year 2007 have historically experienced periodic downturns in the past these sales have been affected by airline profitability which is impacted by among other things fuel and labor costs price competition downturns in the global economy and national and international events such as the events of september 11 2001 prior downturns have adversely affected our net sales gross margin and net income 

we rely heavily on certain customers for much of our sales 

our two largest customers for fiscal year 2007 were boeing which includes aviall inc a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world and honeywell international inc these customers accounted for approximately 16 and 11 respectively of our net sales in fiscal year 2007 our top ten customers for fiscal year 2007 accounted for approximately 51 of our net sales in addition during the second half of fiscal 2006 the boeing company acquired aviall inc during fiscal 2006 the boeing company accounted for approximately 7 of our net sales and aviall inc accounted for approximately 9 of our net sales therefore boeing’s acquisition of aviall inc increases our reliance on the boeing company as a customer see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—overview” 

  

we generally do not have guaranteed future sales of our products further when we enter into fixed price contracts with some of our customers we take the risk for cost overruns 

as is customary in our business we do not generally have longterm contracts with most of our aftermarket customers and therefore do not have guaranteed future sales although we have longterm contracts with many of our oem customers some of those customers may terminate the contracts on short notice and in many other cases our customers have not committed to buy any minimum quantity of our products in addition in certain cases we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon the historic purchasing patterns of customers and upon our discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements and this anticipated future volume of orders may not materialize 

we also have entered into multiyear fixedprice contracts with some of our customers pursuant to which we have agreed to perform the work for a fixed price and accordingly realize all the benefit or detriment resulting from any decreases or increases in the costs of making these products sometimes we accept a fixedprice contract for a product that we have not yet produced and this increases the risk of cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product most of our contracts do not permit us to recover for increases in raw material prices taxes or labor costs although some contracts provide for renegotiation to address certain material adverse changes 

us military spending is dependent upon the us defense budget 

the us department of defense or the dod budget has generally increased for each fiscal year from fiscal 1997 to the budget for fiscal 2007 and based on the bush administration’s current future year defense program the dod budget is expected to continue to increase modestly through fiscal 2010 however future dod budgets after fiscal 2007 could be negatively impacted by several factors including but not limited to the us government’s budget deficits spending priorities the cost of sustaining the us military presence in iraq and afghanistan and possible political pressure to reduce us government military spending each of which could cause the dod budget to remain unchanged or to decline a significant decline in us military expenditures in the future could result in a reduction in the amount of our products sold to the various agencies and buying organizations of the us government 

we are subject to certain unique business risks as a result of supplying equipment and services to the us government in addition government contracts contain unfavorable termination provisions and are subject to modification and audit 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 

 

  

  

  

 most of our us government contracts can be terminated by the us government either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the contract termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination termination for default provisions provide for the contractor to be liable for excess costs incurred by the us government in procuring undelivered items from another source 

  

on contracts where the price is based on cost the us government may review our costs and performance as well as our accounting and general business practices based on the results of such audits the us government may adjust our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs in addition under us government purchasing regulations some of our costs including most financing costs amortization of intangible assets portions of research and development costs and certain marketing expenses may not be subject to reimbursement 

in addition to these us government contract risks we are at times required to obtain approval from us government agencies to export our products additionally we are not permitted to export some of our products a determination by the us government that we failed to receive required approvals or licenses could eliminate or restrict our ability to sell our products outside the united states and the penalties that could be imposed by the us government for failure to comply with these laws could be significant 

certain of our divisions and subsidiaries have been subject to a pricing review by the dod office of inspector general 

five of our divisions and subsidiaries have been the subject of a dod office of inspector general review of our records for the purpose of determining whether the dod’s various buying offices negotiated “fair and reasonable” prices for spare parts purchased from those divisions and subsidiaries during fiscal years 2002 through 2004 on april 19 2006 the inspector general issued its final report dated february 23 2006 and made public a redacted version of the report the report recommends i that the defense logistics agency request that those five subsidiaries and divisions voluntarily refund in the aggregate approximately 26 million for allegedly overpriced parts and ii that defense logistics agency contracting officers reevaluate their procedures for determining the reasonableness of pricing for sole source spare parts purchased from those divisions and subsidiaries and seek to develop strategic supplier alliances with those divisions and subsidiaries 

our position has been and continues to be that our pricing has been fair and reasonable and that there is no legal basis for the amount suggested as a refund by the inspector general in its report in response to the report we offered reasons why we disagree with the inspector general’s overall analysis and why computations related to the voluntary refund contained in the report fail to consider key data such as actual historical sales if the defense logistics agency requests a voluntary refund from any of our divisions or subsidiaries we would consider such a request under the circumstances existing at that time 

in february 2006 the defense logistics agency made a request to initiate discussions regarding future pricing and developing an acquisition strategy that would mutually strengthen our business relationship with the defense logistics agency the parties have discussed future purchasing but negotiations regarding strategic supplier alliances have not commenced but will likely occur at a later date as a result of those negotiations it is possible that the divisions and subsidiaries subject to the pricing review will enter into strategic supplier alliances with the defense logistics agency it is likely that in connection with any strategic supplier alliance the defense logistics agency will seek prices for parts based on cost it is also possible that the dod may seek alternative sources of supply for such parts the entry into strategic supplier alliances or a decision by the dod to pursue alternative sources of supply for parts we currently provide could reduce the amount of revenue we derive from and the profitability of certain of our supply arrangements with certain agencies and buying organizations for the us government 

our business may be adversely affected if we would lose our government or industry approvals or if more stringent government regulations are enacted or if industry oversight is increased 

the aerospace industry is highly regulated in the united states and in other countries in order to sell our components we and the components we manufacture must be certified by the faa the dod and similar agencies in foreign countries and by individual manufacturers if new and more stringent government regulations are adopted or if industry oversight increases we might incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or heightened industry oversight in addition if material authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended our business would be adversely affected 

  

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and could harm our ability to react to changes to our business and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness including the notes 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of september 30 2007 our total indebtedness was approximately 13579 million including premium received net of amortization in connection with the issuance of the original notes which was approximately 736 of our total capitalization in addition we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future for example as of september 30 2007 we had 1984 million of unused commitments under our revolving loan facility although the senior secured credit facility or the senior secured credit facility and the indenture or indenture governing the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes or the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these qualifications and exceptions could be substantial if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage would increase 

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to investors for example it could 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition all of our debt under the senior secured credit facility which includes a 780 million term loan facility and a revolving loan facility of 200 million will bear interest at floating rates accordingly in the event that interest rates increase our debt service expense will also increase in order to reduce the floating interest rate risk the company entered into an interest rate swap in june 2006 for fixed interest rates on 187 million of the senior secured credit facility this interest rate swap decreased to 170 million on september 23 2007 and will decrease to 150 million on september 23 2008 through june 23 2009 

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness including the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital 

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make payments on our indebtedness including the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes and amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility and to fund our operations will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future which to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

  

we cannot assure you however that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all or that future borrowings will be available to us under the senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness including the amounts borrowed under the senior secured credit facility and the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes or to fund our other liquidity needs if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital we cannot assure you that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations the terms of existing or future debt instruments the indenture and the senior secured credit facility may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives in addition any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms and would otherwise adversely affect the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes 

the terms of the senior secured credit facility and the indenture may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

the senior secured credit facility and the indenture contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indenture and may limit their ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests the senior secured credit facility and indenture include covenants restricting among other things the ability of td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indenture to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the senior secured credit facility or the indenture if any such default occurs the lenders under the senior secured credit facility and the holders of the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder to be immediately due and payable the lenders under the senior secured credit facility also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings in addition following an event of default under the senior secured credit facility the lenders under that facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which includes our available cash and they will also have the right to prevent us from making debt service payments on the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes if the debt under the senior secured credit facility or the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt 

  

we are dependent on our highly trained employees and any work stoppage or difficulty hiring similar employees could adversely affect our business 

because our products are complicated and highly engineered we depend on an educated and trained workforce there is substantial competition for skilled personnel in the aircraft component industry and we could be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled employees we may not be able to fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover or attract and retain qualified personnel 

as of september 30 2007 we had approximately 2100 employees approximately 5 of our employees were represented by the united steelworkers union approximately 4 were represented by the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america and approximately 4 were represented by the international brotherhood of electrical workers collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire in april 2008 november 2008 and may 2009 respectively although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory we cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory renewal of these collective bargaining agreements or that our employee relations will remain stable because we maintain a relatively small inventory of finished goods any work stoppage could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide products to our customers 

our business is dependent on the availability of certain components and raw materials from suppliers 

our business is affected by the price and availability of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our components our business therefore could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our suppliers such as the destruction of our suppliers’ facilities or their distribution infrastructure a work stoppage or strike by our suppliers’ employees or the failure of our suppliers to provide materials of the requisite quality or by increased costs of such raw materials or components if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers because we maintain a relatively small inventory of raw materials and component parts our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers or alternative raw materials or component parts the lengthy and expensive faa and oem certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier raw material or component part 

we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under such environmental laws and regulations 

our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things discharges of pollutants into the air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and the remediation of contamination we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and sanctions andor third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws relevant common law or the environmental permits required for our operations 

pursuant to certain environmental laws a current or previous owner or operator of a contaminated site may be held liable for the entire cost of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous materials at such property whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of any hazardous materials persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials may also be held liable for such costs related to a disposal or treatment site regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by them contaminants have been detected at some of our present and former sites principally in connection with historical operations and investigations andor cleanups have been undertaken by us or by former owners of the sites we also receive inquiries and notices of potential liability with respect to offsite disposal facilities from time to time although we are not aware of any sites for which material obligations exist the discovery of additional contaminants the imposition of additional cleanup obligations or the initiation of suits for personal injury or damages to property or natural resources could result in significant liability 

  

we intend to pursue future acquisitions our business may be adversely affected if we cannot consummate acquisitions on satisfactory terms or if we cannot effectively integrate acquired operations 

a significant portion of our growth has occurred through acquisitions any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions we intend to pursue acquisitions that we believe will present opportunities consistent with our overall business strategy however we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates to purchase or may be unable to acquire desired businesses or assets on economically acceptable terms in addition we may not be able to raise the capital necessary to fund future acquisitions in addition acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect 

we regularly engage in discussions with respect to potential acquisition and investment opportunities if we consummate an acquisition our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly future acquisitions could likely result in the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest and amortization expenses or periodic impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets as well as significant charges relating to integration costs 

in addition we may not be able to successfully integrate any business we acquire into our existing business the successful integration of new businesses depends on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs the successful integration of future acquisitions may also require substantial attention from our senior management and the management of the acquired business which could decrease the time that they have to service and attract customers and develop new products and services in addition because we may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously we may encounter unforeseen expenses complications and delays including difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight 

we have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets which may never generate the returns we expect 

our acquisitions have resulted in significant increases in identifiable intangible assets and goodwill identifiable intangible assets which primarily include trademarks trade names trade secrets license agreements and technology were approximately 3349 million at september 30 2007 representing approximately 162 of our total assets goodwill recognized in accounting for the warburg merger and other recent acquisitions was approximately 12479 million at september 30 2007 representing approximately 605 of our total assets we may never realize the full value of our identifiable intangible assets and goodwill and to the extent we were to determine that our identifiable intangible assets and our goodwill were impaired within the meaning of applicable accounting regulations we would be required to writeoff the amount of any impairment 

we face significant competition 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry and compete against a number of companies including divisions of larger companies some of which have significantly greater resources than we do and therefore may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can competitors in our product lines are both us and foreign companies and range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privately held entities we believe that our ability to compete depends on high product performance consistent high quality short leadtime and timely delivery competitive pricing superior customer service and support and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs we may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive 

  

we could be adversely affected if one of our components causes an aircraft to crash 

our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we have designed manufactured or serviced while we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future products liability claims in the event of product liability claims our insurers may attempt to deny coverage or any coverage we have may not be adequate we also may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost any liability not covered by insurance or for which third party indemnification is not available could result in significant liability to us 

in addition a crash caused by one of our components could damage our reputation for quality products we believe our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting a provider of aircraft components if a crash were to be caused by one of our components or if we were to otherwise fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected 

our stock prices may be volatile and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 

there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities which is unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities these broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the purchase price due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects including possible changes due to the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry and other factors such as fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering which could cause shortterm swings in profit margins 

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our share price 

a substantial amount of our outstanding stock is held by affiliates and not currently traded in the public market while the sale of these shares into the open market may be limited by applicable regulations the stockholders of these shares are not bound by any contractual obligations not to sell thus our existing stockholders may sell additional shares of common stock into the public markets in addition we may sell additional shares of common stock into the public markets or issue convertible debt securities to raise capital in the future the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public markets or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities to raise capital at a time and price that we deem appropriate 

our principal stockholder and its affiliates will be able to influence matters requiring stockholder approval and could discourage the purchase of our outstanding shares at a premium 

warburg pincus through its control of td group llc is deemed to beneficially own approximately 45 of our outstanding common stock as of november 1 2007 this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying preventing or deterring a change in control of our company could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale or merger of our company and may negatively affect the market price of our common stock these transactions might include proxy contests tender offers mergers or other purchase of common stock that could give you the opportunity to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for shares of our common stock 

as a result of warburg pincus’ significant ownership of td group llc and representation on our board of directors warburg pincus will be able to influence the affairs and actions of our company including matters requiring stockholder approval such as the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions the interest of warburg pincus may differ from the interest of our other stockholders for example warburg pincus could oppose a third party offer to acquire us that you might consider attractive and the third party may not be able or willing to proceed unless warburg pincus supports the offer in addition if our board of 

  

directors supports a transaction requiring a vote of stockholders warburg pincus is in a position to affect any required stockholder approval in each of these cases and in similar situations you may disagree with warburg pincus as to whether the action opposed or supported by warburg pincus is in the best interest of our stockholders 

our corporate documents and delaware law contain certain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable for example our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 149600000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock without stockholder approval the board of directors has the authority to attach special rights including voting and dividend rights to this preferred stock with these rights holders of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us in addition our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered board of directors whereby directors serve for threeyear terms with approximately onethird of the directors coming up for reelection each year having a staggered board will make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of our board of directors through a proxy contest which may be a necessary step in an acquisition of us that is not favored by our board of directors our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75 of the voting power of our issued and outstanding capital stock voting together as a single class is required for the alteration amendment or repeal of certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation including the provisions authorizing a staggered board and certain provisions of our amended and restated bylaws including the provisions relating to our stockholders’ ability to call special meetings notice provisions for stockholder business to be conducted at an annual meeting requests for stockholder lists and corporate records nomination and removal of directors and filling of vacancies on our board of directors 

we are also subject to the antitakeover provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law under these provisions if anyone becomes an “interested stockholder” we may not enter into a “business combination” with that person for three years without special approval which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change of control for purposes of section 203 “interested stockholder” means generally someone owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years subject to certain exceptions as described in section 203 td group llc warburg pincus and their affiliates do not constitute “interested stockholders” for the purposes of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law 

we do not intend to pay regular cash dividends on our stock 

we do not anticipate declaring or paying regular cash dividends on our common stock or any other equity security in the foreseeable future the amounts that may be available to us to pay cash dividends are restricted under out debt and other agreements any payment of cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations earnings capital requirements financial condition future prospects contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors therefore you should not rely on dividend income from shares of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected consolidated financial data” and td group’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report references to “transdigm” “the company” “we” “us” “our” and similar references refer to td group transdigm inc and transdigm inc’s subsidiaries unless the context otherwise indicates the following discussion may contain predictions estimates and other forwardlooking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties including those discussed under the heading entitled “risk factors” included elsewhere in this report these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 

overview 

we believe we are a leading global designer producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers some of our more significant product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include ignition systems and components mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls gear pumps engineered connectors specialized valving power conditioning devices engineered latches and cockpit security devices specialized acdc electric motors lavatory hardware and components holdopen rods and locking devices aircraft audio systems nicad batterieschargers and specialized fluorescent lighting and cockpit displays each of these product offerings consists of many individual products that are typically customized to meet the needs of a particular aircraft platform or customer 

for fiscal year 2007 we generated net sales of 5928 million and net income of 886 million in addition for fiscal year 2007 our ebitda was 2578 million or 435 of net sales our ebitda as defined was 2747 million or 463 of net sales and our capital expenditures were 103 million or 17 of net sales see “ebitda and ebitda as defined” below for certain information regarding ebitda and ebitda as defined including a reconciliation of ebitda and ebitda as defined to net income 

we estimate that over 90 of our net sales for fiscal year 2007 were generated by proprietary products for which we own the design these products are generally approved and certified by airframe manufacturers who often certify only one manufacturer’s component design for a specific application on an aircraft government agencies andor the faa and similar entities or agencies in addition for fiscal year 2007 we estimate that we generated approximately 75 of our net sales from products for which we are the sole source provider 

most of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue once our parts are designed into and sold as original equipment on an aircraft we generate net sales from recurring aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft this installed base and our sole source provider position generate a longterm stream of aftermarket revenues over the estimated 30year life of an individual aircraft we estimate that approximately 60 of our net sales in fiscal year 2007 were generated from aftermarket sales the vast majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets these aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and been more stable than sales to oems 

in fiscal year 2007 our top two customers accounted for approximately 27 of our net sales and during this same period our top ten customers accounted for approximately 51 of our net sales however our components are ultimately used on a large diverse installed base of aircraft and therefore we are not overly dependent on any single airframe produced by any of our customers or other ultimate endusers of our products in the commercial aerospace sector which generated approximately 73 of our net sales for fiscal year 2007 we sell to distributors of aftermarket components as well as directly to commercial airlines aircraft maintenance facilities systems suppliers and aircraft and engine oems in addition for fiscal year 2007 approximately 24 of our net sales were attributable to the defense aerospace sector net sales to the defense sector are generated 

  

primarily through sales to the united states and foreign militaries brokers distributors and defense oems the remaining portion of our net sales in fiscal year 2007 or approximately 3 of our net sales during this period were derived from industries with similar niche engineered product characteristics such as the mining and power generation industries 

public offerings 

on may 25 2007 certain of td group’s stockholders including certain members of our management sold an aggregate of 115 million shares of td group’s common stock in an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of 3525 per share as a result of this offering td group is no longer a “controlled company” for the purposes of the nyse listing requirements td group did not sell any shares in the offering and did not receive any proceeds from the offering 

on march 20 2006 certain stockholders of td group and certain members of our management sold an aggregate of approximately 12 6 million shares of td group’s common stock in the initial public offering at a price of 2100 per share td group did not offer any shares of its common stock for sale in the initial public offering and td group did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of such shares by the selling stockholders as a result of the initial public offering td group’s common stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “tdg” 

certain acquisitions 

bruce acquisition 

on august 10 2007 pursuant to an asset purchase agreement among transdigm inc bruce industries and the shareholders of bruce industries bruce aerospace inc a newly formed whollyowned subsidiary of transdigm inc acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of bruce industries for approximately 356 million in cash bruce designs and manufactures specialized fluorescent lighting used in the aircraft industry the proprietary nature established positions and aftermarket content fit well with our overall business direction 

ati acquisition 

on february 7 2007 transdigm inc acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of aviation technologies inc “ati” for 4301 million in cash ati consists of two primary operating units that service the commercial and military aerospace markets—avtech corporation “avtech” and transicoil llc which together with transicoil malaysia sendirian berhad is referred to as “adstransicoil” avtech is a leading supplier of flight deck and passenger audio systems cabin lighting and power control products and related components adstransicoil is a leading supplier of displays clocks brushless motors and related components and instruments through avtech and adstransicoil ati manufactures proprietary products for the aerospace industry with broad platform positions and high aftermarket content all of which fit well with transdigm’s overall direction 

the purchase price consideration and costs associated with the acquisition of 4301 million were funded through additional borrowings under our senior secured credit facility of 1254 million net of fees of 46 million the proceeds from the issuance by transdigm inc of additional 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes of 2965 net of fees of 65 million and the use of 82 million of our available cash balances 

mr w nicholas howley chairman and chief executive officer of td group and mr douglas peacock a director of td group each indirectly owned less than onehalf of 1 of ati’s outstanding equity on a fully diluted basis in addition prior to the acquisition mr howley and mr peacock were directors of ati commencing in 2003 and mr peacock served as ati’s chairman from 2003 through february 2007 

  

cda acquisition 

on october 3 2006 transdigm inc acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of cda for an aggregate purchase price of 457 million in cash cda designs and manufactures specialized controllable drive actuators motors transducers and gearing cda’s products are used on a range of defense space and commercial aircraft applications the proprietary nature established positions and aftermarket content of cda’s products fit well with our overall business direction 

sweeney acquisition 

on june 12 2006 transdigm inc acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of sweeney engineering corp “sweeney” for approximately 254 million in cash sweeney designs and manufactures specialized aerospace valving used primarily in fuel environmental control and deicing applications sweeneys products are used on a range of defense and commercial aircraft applications sweeney’s product characteristics and market position fit well with our existing valving business the acquired business was consolidated into our aerocontrolex business in painesville ohio during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 

electramotion acquisition 

on may 1 2006 skurka our whollyowned subsidiary acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of electramotion the acquired business designs and manufactures specialized acdc motors for a broad range of aerospace applications the acquired business was consolidated into skurka’s existing aerospace motor business in camarillo california during fiscal 2006 

  

ebitda and ebitda as defined 

the following table sets forth the calculation of ebitda and ebitda as defined 

 

           

   

  

  

  

  

 because of these limitations ebitda and ebitda as defined should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business management compensates for these limitations by not viewing ebitda or ebitda as defined in isolation and specifically by using other gaap measures such as net income net sales and operating profit to measure our operating performance neither ebitda nor ebitda as defined is a measurement of financial performance under gaap and neither should be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations determined in accordance with gaap and our calculation of ebitda and ebitda as defined may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

trend information 

the commercial aerospace industry is impacted by the health of the global economy and geopolitical events around the world the commercial aerospace industry suffered after the events of september 11 2001 and the subsequent downturn in the global economy the sars epidemic and more recently from rising fuel prices and the conflicts in the middle east recently the industry has shown strength with increases in rpms as well as oem production and backlog rising fuel prices conflicts in the middle east and the risk of additional terrorist activity have tempered the recovery somewhat 

  

our presence in both the commercial transport and military sectors of the aerospace industry may mitigate the impact on our business of any specific industry risk we service a diversified customer base in the commercial and military aerospace industry and we provide components to a diverse installed base of aircraft which mitigates our exposure to any individual airframe platform at times declines in sales in any one sector have been offset by increased sales in another for example the commercial transport sector that we serve was adversely affected by the events of september 11 2001 but the downturn in that market was partially offset by an increase in military aircraft spending that resulted from the military engagements in afghanistan and iraq and the war on terrorism 

there is industry consensus that conditions in the commercial transport market sector has improved recently we are experiencing increased activity in the large commercial oem sector aircraft with 100 or more seats driven by order announcements by the boeing company and airbus sas the business jet oem sector has also shown increased activity driven by the overall recovery of the economy we expect this level of activity to continue in the near future 

rpms have surpassed the preseptember 11 2001 level and absent any disruptive events we are hopeful our aftermarket business will continue to follow this trend 

in recent years defense spending has reached historic highs due in part to the military engagements in afghanistan and iraq and the war on terrorism the military business showed some modest gains from the prior year our military business fluctuates from year to year and is dependent to a degree on government budget constraints the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts we anticipate that military related sales of our types of products will experience modest growth over the current high levels 

the aerospace industry is cyclical and fragmented there are many shortterm factors including inventory corrections unannounced changes in order patterns and mergers and acquisitions that can cause shortterm disruptions in our quarterly shipment patterns as compared to previous quarters and the same periods in prior years to normalize for shortterm fluctuations we tend to look at our performance over several quarters or years of activity rather than discreet shortterm periods as such it can be difficult to determine longerterm trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons 

there are also fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering and delivery requests from quartertoquarter due to the differences between the profitability of our products sold to oem and aftermarket customers variation in product mix can cause shortterm swings in gross margins again in many instances these are timing events between quarters and must be balanced with macro aerospace industry indicators 

we believe that the boeing company and airbus sas are in a period of increased production and we think we are well positioned on the new aircraft platforms recently announced having significant content on these new aircraft platforms could negatively impact our margin over the near term given that oem revenues tend to produce lower gross margins than aftermarket revenues but should positively impact our business in future years as replacement aftermarket parts will be required to service these new aircrafts 

although the aerospace industry is in a cycle of increased production our business would be adversely affected by significant changes in the us or global economy historically aircraft travel as measured by rpms generally correlates to economic conditions and a reduction in aircraft travel would result in a decrease in the need for aftermarket parts which in turn would adversely affect our business 

  

government pricing review 

certain parts sold by five of our divisions and subsidiaries to the department of defense “dod” through various buying agencies of the defense logistics agency have been the subject of a pricing review by the dod office of inspector general the pricing review examined whether the various buying offices within the defense logistics agency had negotiated “fair and reasonable” prices for certain sole source spare parts purchased from those divisions and subsidiaries during fiscal years 2002 through 2004 on february 28 2006 we received a copy of the inspector general’s final report dated february 23 2006 and on april 19 2006 a redacted version of such report was made publicly available the report recommends among other things that the defense logistics agency contracting officers reevaluate their procedures for determining the reasonableness of pricing for sole source spare parts purchased from those divisions and subsidiaries and seek to develop strategic supplier alliances with those divisions and subsidiaries 

we believe that the pricing review is part of a continuing effort by the inspector general to monitor and evaluate prices paid to defense contractors for sole source spare parts the report is consistent with reports issued with respect to sole source spare parts supplied by other companies and like those other reports it advocates the negotiation of strategic supplier alliances incorporating prices for parts based on cost rather than based on prices of comparable commercial parts or other methods we believe that our pricing of spare parts comports with the regulations applicable to contracts with agencies of the federal government nonetheless the report recommends that the defense logistics agency request that the applicable divisions and subsidiaries of transdigm inc voluntarily refund in the aggregate approximately 26 million for allegedly overpriced parts and negotiate strategic supplier alliances incorporating costbased prices for future defense logistics agency purchases of sole source spare parts 

the company’s position has been and continues to be that our pricing has been fair and reasonable and that there is no legal basis for the amount suggested as a refund by the inspector general in its report in response to the report we offered reasons why we disagree with the inspector general’s overall analysis the defense logistics agency requested additional information from the company and the company’s position on the voluntary refund the company responded to such request 

in february 2006 the defense logistics agency made a request to initiate discussions regarding future pricing and develop an acquisition strategy that will mutually strengthen transdigm’s and the defense logistics agency’s business relationship the parties have discussed and are considering future purchasing approaches but negotiations with the defense logistics agency regarding strategic supplier alliances or any specific approach have not yet commenced but will likely occur at a later date as a result of those negotiations it is possible that the divisions and subsidiaries subject to the pricing review will enter into strategic supplier alliances with the defense logistics agency it is likely in connection with any strategic supplier alliance the defense logistics agency will seek prices for parts based on cost or may seek volume discounts or other favorable pricing andor the applicable division or subsidiary may agree to cost or pricing justification or appropriate discounts it is also possible that the dod may seek alternative sources of supply for such parts 

the entry into strategic supplier alliances or a decision by the dod to pursue alternative sources of supply for our sole source parts could reduce the amount of revenue we derive from and the profitability of certain of our supply arrangements with certain agencies and buying organizations of the us government while management believes that the entry into strategic supplier alliances with the defense logistics agency will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity or capital resources there is no means to determine the outcome of any future negotiations or discussions at this time 

  

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations however investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 

we have identified the following as the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial status depends these critical policies were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments our most critical accounting policies are as follows 

revenue recognition and related allowances substantially all of our revenues are recognized based upon shipment of products to the customer at which time title and risk of loss passes to the customer substantially all sales are made pursuant to firm fixedprice purchase orders received from customers provisions for returns uncollectible accounts and the cost of repairs under contract warranty provisions are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are principally based on historical results modified as appropriate by the most current information available we have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of such allowances however due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process it is possible that actual results may vary from the estimates and the differences could be material 

management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable and customer creditworthiness the allowance also incorporates a provision for the estimated impact of disputes with customers management’s estimate of the allowance amounts that are necessary includes amounts for specifically identified losses and a general amount for estimated losses based on historical information the determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to significant levels of judgment and estimation by management if circumstances change or economic conditions deteriorate management may need to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company provides limited warranties in connection with the sale of its products the warranty period for products sold varies throughout the company’s operations ranging from 90 days to five years in addition certain contracts with distributors contain right of return provisions the company accrues for estimated returns and warranty claims based on knowledge of product performance issues and excess inventories provided by its customers and industry sources the company also provides a general amount based on historical results historically actual product returns and warranty claims have not differed materially from the estimates originally established 

inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost of inventories is determined by the average cost and the firstin firstout fifo methods because the company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be inservice for 30 or more years it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use provision for potentially obsolete or slowmoving inventory is made based on our analysis of inventory levels past usage and future sales forecasts although management believes that the company’s estimates of obsolete and slowmoving inventory are reasonable actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future in addition in accordance with industry practice all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year 

intangible assets mergers and acquisitions have resulted in significant amounts of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights or if the intangible asset can be sold transferred licensed or exchanged regardless of the company’s intent to do so goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and under financial accounting standards board statement no 142 

  

“ goodwill and other intangible assets ” “sfas 142” are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates the determination of undiscounted cash flows is based on the company’s strategic plans and longrange planning forecasts the revenue growth rates included in the plans are based on industry and company specific data the profit margin assumptions included in the plans are projected based on the current cost structure and anticipated cost changes if different assumptions were used in these plans the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different and the recognition of an impairment loss might be required intangible assets such as goodwill trademarks and trade names that have an indefinite useful life are not amortized all other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 

stock options and deferred compensation plans the company accounts for the cost of its stock options under the provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment”  which requires the measurement of compensation expense under the stock option plan to be based on the fair value of the awards under the plan on the grant dates and amortizes the expense over the options’ vesting periods in addition the company accounts for the cost of the deferred compensation plans of td group in accordance with opinion no 12 of the accounting principles board which requires the cost of deferred compensation arrangements to be accrued over the service period of the related employees in a systematic and rational manner 

purchase accounting the warburg merger and our other acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method accordingly fair value adjustments to the company’s assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in its consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition we generally use thirdparty appraisals to assist us in determining the fair value adjustments

selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased by 146 million or 302 to 629 million for fiscal year 2007 from 483 million for fiscal year 2006 the prior year period included nonrecurring costs of 62 million for a onetime special bonus and 27 million of costs associated with the initial public offering these prior year costs were partially offset by a 38 million reversal of charges resulting from the termination of two deferred compensation plans in fiscal 2006 the net reduction of prior year non operating activity of approximately 51 million or 12 of prior year net sales was partially offset by an increase in selling and administrative costs associated with higher sales volume discussed above higher research and development costs of 58 million or 10 of net sales relating to the boeing 787 and other new programs and 17 million or 03 of net sales of costs associated with the secondary offering 

selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 106 for fiscal year 2007 from 111 for the comparable period last year primarily due to the factors described above 

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles increased by 61 million to 123 million for fiscal year 2007 from 62 million for fiscal year 2006 the increase was primarily due to the additional identifiable intangible assets recognized in connection with the acquisitions of the businesses of cda ati and bruce industries of which 36 million related to order backlog amortization that is typically amortized over 12 months 

refinancing costs refinancing costs represented a onetime charge that was recorded in june 2006 as a result of the refinancing of transdigm’s entire debt structure the charge of 486 million consisted of the premium of 256 million paid to redeem our 8 3  8  senior subordinated notes and the writeoff of 229 million of debt issue costs associated with our former senior credit facility our 8 3  8  senior subordinated notes and the td group loan facility and other expenses of 01 million

interest expense  interest expense increased 151 million or 196 to 918 million for fiscal year 2007 from 767 million for fiscal year 2006 the net increase was primarily the result of an increase of our outstanding borrowings of approximately 430 million related to the acquisition of ati in february 2007 partially offset by lower interest rates from the refinancing of our debt structure during june 2006 the company’s weighted average level of outstanding borrowings increased to approximately 12 billion during fiscal 2007 from approximately 904 million during fiscal 2006 while the average interest rate decreased to 76 during fiscal 2007 from 82 during fiscal 2006 see “liquidity and capital resources” below 

income taxes  income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately 376 for fiscal year 2007 compared to 394 for fiscal year 2006 the lower effective tax rate was primarily due to lower state and local taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes and a decrease in nondeductible public offering expenses these reductions were partially offset by an income tax benefit of 15 million or 38 of the income before income taxes recorded in fiscal 2006 resulting from the adoption of a change in texas tax law enacted in may 2006 

  

net income net income increased 635 million or 253 to 886 million for fiscal year 2007 compared to 251 million for fiscal year 2006 primarily as a result of the refinancing in fiscal 2006 and other factors referred to above

selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased by 94 million or 241 to 483 million for fiscal year 2006 from 389 million for fiscal year 2005 the increase was due to i a onetime special bonus of 62 million or 14 of net sales paid to certain members of management ii the costs associated with higher net sales discussed above and iii initial public offing costs of 27 million or 06 of net sales these increases were partially offset by i reversal of previously recorded charges of 38 million or 09 of net sales resulting from the termination in fiscal 2006 of the rollover deferred compensation plan and management deferred compensation plan and ii the decrease of 32 million due to lower compensation expense recorded under the new management deferred compensation plan adopted in december 2005

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles decreased by 16 million to 62 million for fiscal year 2006 from 78 million for fiscal year 2005 the decrease was primarily due to order backlog that was recorded in accounting for acquisitions made in fiscal 2005 that was subsequently fully amortized in fiscal 2006 

refinancing costs refinancing costs represent a onetime charge that was recorded in june 2006 as a result of the refinancing of transdigm’s entire debt structure the charge of 486 million consisted of the premium of 256 million paid to redeem our 8 3  8  senior subordinated notes and the writeoff of 229 million of debt issue costs associated with our former senior credit facility our 8 3  8  senior subordinated notes and the td group loan facility and other expenses of 01 million

backlog 

as of september 30 2007 the company estimated its sales order backlog at 3652 million compared to an estimated sales order backlog of 2513 million as of september 30 2006 this increase in backlog of 1139 million is due in part to the acquisitions of the businesses of cda ati and bruce industries discussed above totaling approximately 660 million the balance of the increase in sales order backlog is due to increases in orders across existing product lines in both the oem and aftermarket segments the majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of september 30 2007 are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months purchase orders may be subject to cancellation by the customer prior to shipment the level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of the company’s receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled accordingly the company’s backlog as of september 30 2007 may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period 

foreign operations 

we manufacture substantially all of our products in the united states however as a result of our ati acquisition some of our products are manufactured in malaysia we sell our products in the united states as well as in foreign countries substantially all of our foreign sales are transacted in us dollars and therefore we have no material exposure to fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the us dollar as a result of foreign sales in addition the amount of components or other raw materials or supplies that we purchase from foreign suppliers including our malaysian manufacturing subsidiary are not material with substantially all such transactions being made in us dollars accordingly we have no material exposure to currency fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the us dollar arising from these transactions 

our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately 1430 million 1027 million and 815 million for fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks including the impact of foreign government regulations political uncertainties and differences in business practices there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments’ countries furthermore there can be no assurance that the political cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 

inflation

liquidity and capital resources 

operating activities the company generated 1124 million of cash from operating activities during fiscal 2007 compared to 31 million generated during fiscal 2006 the increase of 1093 million is primarily due to i the absence in 2007 of the 627 million of interest paid in fiscal 2006 relating to the 12 senior unsecured promissory notes ii the absence in 2007 of the distributions to participants in our deferred compensation plans totaling approximately 260 million in november 2005 in connection with the distributions under the deferred compensation plans our board of directors approved the termination of the plans during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 iii the absence in 2007 of the payment in november 2005 of a onetime special bonus to certain members of management of 62 million and iv the increase in operating cash flows from higher sales and other factors 

we generated 31 million of cash from operating activities during fiscal 2006 compared to 807 million generated during fiscal 2005 the decrease of 776 million is primarily due to i the payment of accrued interest of 627 million relating to the 12 senior unsecured promissory notes and 123 million relating to the td group loan facility ii the distributions to participants in our deferred compensation plans totaling approximately 260 million in november 2005 and iii the payment of a onetime special bonus to certain members of management of 62 million these decreases are partially offset by a 296 million increase in operating cash flows as a result of an increase in net sales and other factors

contractual obligations 

the following is a summary of contractual cash obligations as of september 30 2007 in millions 

 

    

  in addition to the contractual obligations set forth above the company incurs capital expenditures for the purpose of maintaining and replacing existing equipment and facilities and from time to time for facility expansion capital expenditures totaled approximately 103 million 83 million and 80 million during fiscal 2007 2006 and fiscal 2005 respectively the company expects its capital expenditures in fiscal 2008 to be approximately 17 million and such expenditures are projected to increase moderately thereafter 

the company intends to pursue acquisitions that present opportunities consistent with the company’s business direction the company regularly engages in discussions with respect to potential acquisitions and investments however there can be no assurance that the company will be able to consummate an agreement with respect to any future acquisition the company’s acquisition strategy may require substantial capital and no assurance can be given that the company will be able to raise any necessary funds on acceptable terms or at all if the company incurs additional debt to finance acquisitions total interest expense will increase 

if the company has excess cash it may consider methods by which it can provide cash to its debt or equity holders through a dividend prepayment of indebtedness repurchase of stock or other means such activities will depend on prevailing market conditions the company’s liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material in addition the company may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend at september 30 2007 the company had borrowings under its senior secured credit facility of 780 million that was subject to interest rate risk borrowings under the senior secured credit facility bear interest at its option at a rate equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted libo rate for a one two three or sixmonth or to the extent available to each lender nine or twelve month interest period chosen by transdigm inc in each case plus an applicable margin percentage accordingly the company’s cash flows and earnings 

  

will be exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes resulting from variable rate borrowings under its senior secured credit facility the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the annual interest costs under the senior secured credit facility by approximately 78 million based on the amount of outstanding borrowings at september 30 2007 the weighted average interest rate on the 780 million of borrowings under the senior secured credit facility on september 30 2007 was 72 

at september 30 2007 we had an agreement in place to swap variable interest rates on the senior secured credit facility for fixed interest rates through june 23 2009 for the notional amount of 170 million which will decrease to 150 million on september 23 2008 through june 23 2009 the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement is adjusted at each balance sheet date with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income at september 30 2007 the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was a liability of 29 million 

because the interest rates on borrowings under the senior secured credit facility vary with market conditions the amount of outstanding borrowings under the senior secured credit facility approximates the fair value of the indebtedness the fair value of the 575 million aggregate principal amount of the transdigm inc’s 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes is exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes the estimated fair value of such notes approximated 581 million at september 30 2007 based upon the quoted market rates

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

the board of directors and shareholders of 

transdigm group incorporated 

we have audited transdigm group incorporated’s internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2007 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria transdigm group incorporated’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

as indicated in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include an assessment of the effectiveness of the internal controls over financial reporting of aviation technologies inc which was acquired on february 7 2007 aviation technologies inc is included in the 2007 consolidated financial statements of transdigm group incorporated since february 7 2007 and constituted 4872 million of total assets as of september 30 2007 and approximately 710 million and 25 million of revenues and income before income taxes respectively for the year ended september 30 2007 our audit of internal control over financial reporting of transdigm group incorporated also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of aviation technologies inc 

in our opinion transdigm group incorporated maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2007 based on the coso criteria 

  

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of transdigm group incorporated and subsidiaries as of september 30 2007 and 2006 and the related consolidated statements of income shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended september 30 2007 and our report dated november 21 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

we believe we are a leading global designer producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers some of our more significant product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include ignition systems and components gear pumps mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls nicad batterieschargers power conditioning devices holdopen rods and locking devices engineered connectors engineered latches and cockpit security devices lavatory hardware and components specialized acdc electric motors and specialized valving each of these product offerings consists of many individual products that are typically customized to meet the needs of a particular aircraft platform or customer 

we estimate that over 90 of our net sales for fiscal year 2006 were generated by proprietary products for which we own the design in addition for fiscal year 2006 we estimate that we generated approximately 75 of our net sales from products for which we are the sole source provider 

most of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue once our parts are designed into and sold as original equipment on an aircraft we generate net sales from recurring aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft which is generally estimated to be approximately 30 years we estimate that approximately 60 of our net sales in fiscal year 2006 were generated from aftermarket sales the vast majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets these aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and been more stable than sales to original equipment manufacturers or oems 

  

products 

we primarily design produce and supply highlyengineered proprietary aerospace components and limited systemsubsystems with significant aftermarket content we seek to develop highly customized products to solve specific needs for aircraft operators and manufacturers we attempt to differentiate ourselves based on engineering service and manufacturing capabilities we typically choose not to compete for nonproprietary “build to print” business because it usually offers lower margins than proprietary products we believe that our products have strong brand names within the industry and that we have a reputation for high quality reliability and customer support 

our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products that we offer to our customers some of our more significant product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include 1 ignition systems and components such as igniters exciters and spark plugs used to start and spark turbine and reciprocating aircraft engines 2 gear pumps used primarily in lubrication and fuel applications 3 mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls used in numerous actuation applications 4 nicad batterieschargers used to provide starting and backup power 5 power conditioning devices used to modify and control electrical power 6 rods and locking devices used primarily to hold open cowlings to allow access to engines for maintenance 7 engineered connectors used in fuel pneumatic and hydraulic applications 8 engineered latching and locking devices used in various bin security and other applications 9 lavatory hardware and components 10 specialized acdc electric motors and components used in various defense and commercial applications and 11 specialized valving used in fuel hydraulic and pneumatic applications

consistent with our overall strategy our sales and marketing organization is structured to continually develop technical solutions that meet customer needs in particular we attempt to focus on products and programs that will lead to highmargin repeatable sales in the aftermarket 

we have structured our sales efforts along our major product offerings assigning a product manager to certain products each product manager is expected to grow the sales and profitability of the products for which he is responsible and to achieve the targeted annual level of bookings sales new business and profitability for such products the product managers are assisted by account managers and sales engineers who are responsible for covering major oem and airline accounts account managers and sales engineers are expected to be familiar with the personnel organization and needs of specific customers to achieve total bookings and new business goals at each account and together with the product managers to determine when additional resources are required at customer locations most of our sales personnel are compensated in part on their bookings and their ability to identify and obtain new business opportunities 

though typically performed by employees the account manager function may be performed by independent representatives depending on the specific customer product and geographic location we also use a number of distributors to provide logistical support as well as primary customer contact with certain smaller accounts our major distributors are aviall inc and satair as 

manufacturing and engineering 

we maintain nine principal manufacturing facilities each manufacturing facility comprises manufacturing distribution and engineering as well as administrative functions including management sales and finance we continually strive to improve productivity and reduce costs including rationalization of operations developing improved control systems that allow for accurate product profit and loss accounting investing in equipment tooling and information systems and implementing broadbased employee training programs management believes that our manufacturing systems and equipment contribute to our ability to compete by permitting us to meet the rigorous tolerances and cost sensitive price structure of aircraft component customers 

  

we attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by producing uniquely engineered products with high quality and timely delivery our engineering costs are recorded in cost of sales and in selling and administrative captions in our statement of operations total engineering expense represents approximately 8 to 9 of our manufacturing cost of sales or approximately 4 to 5 of our net sales our proprietary products are designed by our engineering staff and are intended to serve the needs of the aircraft component industry particularly through our new product initiatives these proprietary designs must withstand the extraordinary conditions and stresses that will be endured by products during use and meet the rigorous demands of our customers’ tolerance and quality requirements 

we use sophisticated equipment and procedures to attempt to ensure the quality of our products and comply with military specifications and federal aviation administration or faa and oem certification requirements we perform a variety of testing procedures including testing under different temperature humidity and altitude levels shock and vibration testing and xray fluorescent measurement these procedures together with other customer approved techniques for document process and quality control are used throughout our manufacturing facilities 

customers 

our customers include 1 distributors of aerospace components 2 worldwide commercial airlines including national and regional airlines 3 large commercial transport and regional and business aircraft oems 4 various armed forces of the united states and friendly foreign governments 5 defense oems 6 system suppliers and 7 various other industrial customers for the year ended september 30 2006 honeywell international inc accounted for approximately 10 of our net sales and aviall inc a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world accounted for approximately 9 of our net sales products supplied to many of our customers including the two largest customers are used on multiple platforms 

active commercial production programs include the boeing 737 747 757 767 and 777 the airbus a300310 a3192021 and a330a340 the bombardier crj’s and challenger the embraer rj’s the cessna citation family the raytheon premier and hawker and most gulfstream airframes military platforms include aircraft such as the boeing c17 f15 and f18 the lockheed martin c130j and f16 the northrop grumman e2c hawkeye the joint strikefighter and the blackhawk chinook and apache helicopters although not in production yet transdigm has been awarded numerous contracts to develop engineered products for production on the boeing 787 and airbus a380 and a400m programs 

we believe that we have strong customer relationships with almost all large commercial transport regional general aviation and military oems the demand for our aftermarket parts and services depends on among other things the breadth of our installed oem base revenue passenger miles or rpms the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and to a lesser extent airline profitability we believe that we are also a leading supplier of components used on us designed military aircraft including components that are used on a variety of fighter aircraft military freighters and military helicopters 

competition 

the niche markets within the aerospace industry that we serve are relatively fragmented and we face several competitors for many of the products and services we provide due to the global nature of the commercial aircraft industry competition in these categories comes from both us and foreign companies competitors in our product offerings range in size from divisions of large public corporations which have significantly greater financial technological and marketing resources than we do to small privatelyheld entities with only one or two components in their entire product portfolio 

we compete on the basis of engineering manufacturing and marketing high quality products which we believe meet or exceed the performance and maintenance requirements of our customers consistent and timely delivery and superior customer service and support 

  

the industry’s stringent regulatory certification and technical requirements and the investments necessary in the development and certification of products create barriers to entry for potential new competitors so long as customers receive products that meet or exceed expectations and performance standards we believe that they will have a reduced incentive to certify another supplier because of the cost and time of the technical design and testing certification process in addition we believe that concerns about safety and flight delays if products are unavailable or undependable make our customers continue longterm supplier relationships 

government contracts 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 1 suspend us from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations 2 terminate existing contracts 3 reduce the value of existing contracts 4 audit our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs and 5 control and potentially prohibit the export of our products 

most of our us government contracts can be terminated by the us government either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the contract termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination termination for default provisions provide for the contractor to be liable for excess costs incurred by the us government in procuring undelivered items from another source 

as described elsewhere in this report five of our divisions and subsidiaries have been subject to a dod office of inspector general review of our records for the purpose of determining whether the dod’s various buying offices negotiated “fair and reasonable” prices for spare parts purchased from those five divisions and subsidiaries in fiscal years 2002 through 2004 for additional information regarding the details and status of the pricing review please refer to “risk factors—certain of our divisions and subsidiaries have been subject to a pricing review by the dod office of inspector general” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—recent developments” 

governmental regulation 

the commercial aircraft component industry is highly regulated by both the faa in the united states and by the joint aviation authorities in europe and other agencies throughout the world while the military aircraft component industry is governed by military quality specifications we and the components we manufacture are required to be certified by one or more of these entities or agencies and in some cases by individual oems in order to engineer and service parts and components used in specific aircraft models 

we must also satisfy the requirements of our customers including oems and airlines that are subject to faa regulations and provide these customers with products and services that comply with the government regulations applicable to commercial flight operations in addition the faa requires that various maintenance routines be performed on aircraft components and we believe that we currently satisfy or exceed these maintenance standards in our repair and overhaul services we also maintain several faa approved repair stations 

in addition sales of many of our products that will be used on aircraft owned by nonus entities are subject to compliance with us export control laws 

our operations are also subject to a variety of worker and community safety laws the occupational safety and health act or osha mandates general requirements for safe workplaces for all employees in addition osha provides special procedures and measures for the handling of certain hazardous and toxic substances management believes that our operations are in material compliance with osha’s health and safety requirements 

  

raw materials and patents 

we require the use of various raw materials including titanium aluminum nickel powder nickel screen stainless steel iridium and cadmium in our manufacturing processes we also purchase a variety of manufactured component parts from various suppliers at times we concentrate our orders among a few suppliers in order to strengthen our supplier relationships raw materials and component parts are generally available from multiple suppliers at competitive prices 

we have various trade secrets proprietary information trademarks trade names patents copyrights and other intellectual property rights which we believe in the aggregate but not individually are important to our business 

backlog 

as of september 30 2006 we estimated our sales order backlog at 2513 million compared to an estimated 2000 million as of september 30 2005 this increase in backlog is due to the acquisitions of sweeney engineering corp or sweeney and electramotion inc or electramotion totaling approximately 112 million and an increase in orders across existing product lines in both the oem and aftermarket segments the majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of september 30 2006 are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months purchase orders may be subject to cancellation by the customer prior to shipment the level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of our receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled accordingly our backlog as of september 30 2006 may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period 

foreign operations 

substantially all of our operations and assets are located within the united states we purchase certain of the components that we use in our products from foreign suppliers and a portion of our products are resold to foreign endusers our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately 1027 million 815 million and 699 million for fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks including the impact of foreign government regulations political uncertainties and differences in business practices there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments’ countries furthermore there can be no assurance that the political cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 

environmental matters 

our operations and facilities are subject to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations governing among other matters the emission discharge generation management transportation and disposal of hazardous materials wastes and pollutants the investigation and remediation of contaminated sites and permits required in connection with our operations although management believes that our operations and facilities are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws management cannot provide assurance that future changes in such laws or the regulations or requirements thereunder or in the nature of our operations will not require us to make significant additional expenditures to ensure compliance in the future further we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and sanctions and third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws relevant common law or the environmental permits required for our operations 

under some environmental laws a current or previous owner or operator of a contaminated site may be held liable for the entire cost of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous materials at such property whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous materials persons who arrange for disposal or treatment of hazardous materials also may be liable for the costs of 

  

investigation removal or remediation of those substances at a disposal or treatment site regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by them because we own andor operate a number of facilities that have a history of industrial or commercial use and because we arrange for the disposal of hazardous materials at many disposal sites we may and do incur costs for investigation removal and remediation contaminants have been detected at some of our present and former sites principally in connection with historical operations and investigations andor cleanups have been undertaken by us or by former owners of the sites we receive inquiries and notices of potential liability with respect to offsite disposal facilities from time to time although we have not incurred any material investigation or cleanup costs to date and investigation and cleanup costs are not expected to be material in the future the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at these or other sites or the failure of any other potentially liable party to meet its obligations could result in significant liability for us 

employees 

as of september 30 2006 we had approximately 1400 employees approximately 9 of our employees were represented by the united steelworkers union approximately 4 were represented by the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america and approximately 6 were represented by the international brotherhood of electrical workers collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire in april 2008 november 2008 and may 2009 respectively we consider our relationship with our employees generally to be satisfactory 

legal proceedings 

we are from time to time subject to and are presently involved in litigation or other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of business based upon information currently known to us we believe the outcome of such proceedings will not have individually or in the aggregate a material adverse effect on our business our financial condition or results of operations

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend set forth below are important risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business and financial condition and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

future terrorist attacks may have a material adverse impact on our business 

following the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks passenger traffic on commercial flights was significantly lower than prior to the attacks and many commercial airlines reduced their operating schedules overall the terrorist attacks resulted in billions of dollars in losses to the airline industry any future acts of terrorism and any military response to such acts could result in further acts of terrorism and additional hostilities including possible retaliatory attacks on sovereign nations as well as financial economic and political instability while the precise effects of any such terrorist attack military response or instability on our industry and our business is difficult to determine it could result in further reductions in the use of commercial aircraft if demand for new aircraft and spare parts decreases demand for certain of our products would also decrease 

our business is sensitive to the number of flight hours that our customers’ planes spend aloft the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and our customers’ profitability these items are in turn affected by general economic conditions 

our business is directly affected by among other factors changes in revenue passenger miles or rpms the size and age of the worldwide aircraft fleet and to a lesser extent changes in the profitability of the commercial airline industry revenue passenger miles and airline profitability have historically been correlated with the general economic environment although national and international events also play a key role for example rpms declined primarily as a result of increased security concerns among airline customers following the events of september 11 2001 in addition to the events of september 11 2001 in recent years the airline industry has been severely affected by the downturn in the global economy higher fuel prices the severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars epidemic and the conflicts in afghanistan and iraq as a result of the substantial reduction in airline traffic resulting from these events the airline industry incurred and some in the industry continue to incur large losses and financial difficulties some carriers have also parked or retired a portion of their fleets and have reduced workforces and flights during periods of reduced airline profitability some airlines may delay purchases of spare parts preferring instead to deplete existing inventories if demand for new aircraft and spare parts decreases there would be a decrease in demand for certain of our products 

our sales to manufacturers of large aircraft are cyclical and a downturn in sales to these manufacturers may adversely affect us 

our sales to manufacturers of large commercial aircraft which accounted for approximately 15 of our net sales in fiscal year 2006 have historically experienced periodic downturns in the past these sales have been affected by airline profitability which is impacted by among other things fuel and labor costs price competition downturns in the global economy and national and international events such as the events of september 11 2001 prior downturns have adversely affected our net sales gross margin and net income 

we rely heavily on certain customers for much of our sales 

our two largest customers for fiscal year 2006 were honeywell international inc and aviall inc a distributor of commercial aftermarket parts to airlines throughout the world these customers accounted for approximately 10 and 9 respectively of our net sales in fiscal year 2006 our top ten customers for fiscal year 2006 accounted for approximately 48 of our net sales see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—overview” 

  

we generally do not have guaranteed future sales of our products further when we enter into fixed price contracts with some of our customers we take the risk for cost overruns 

as is customary in our business we do not generally have longterm contracts with most of our aftermarket customers and therefore do not have guaranteed future sales although we have longterm contracts with many of our oem customers some of those customers may terminate the contracts on short notice and in many other cases our customers have not committed to buy any minimum quantity of our products in addition in certain cases we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon the historic purchasing patterns of customers and upon our discussions with customers as to their anticipated future requirements and this anticipated future volume of orders may not materialize 

we also have entered into multiyear fixedprice contracts with some of our oem customers pursuant to which we have agreed to perform the work for a fixed price and accordingly realize all the benefit or detriment resulting from any decreases or increases in the costs for making these products sometimes we accept a fixedprice contract for a product that we have not yet produced and the fact that we have not yet produced the product increases the risk of cost overruns or delays in the completion of the design and manufacturing of the product most of our contracts do not permit us to recover for increases in raw material prices taxes or labor costs although some contracts provide for renegotiation to address certain material adverse changes 

us military spending is dependent upon the us defense budget 

the us department of defense or the dod budget has generally increased for each fiscal year from fiscal 1997 to the recently approved budget for fiscal 2007 and based on the bush administration’s current future year defense program the dod budget is expected to continue to increase modestly through fiscal 2010 however future dod budgets after fiscal 2007 could be negatively impacted by several factors including but not limited to the us government’s budget deficits and spending priorities and the cost of sustaining the us military presence and rebuilding operations in iraq and afghanistan which could cause the dod budget to remain unchanged or to decline a significant decline in us military expenditures in the future could result in a reduction in the amount of our products sold to the various agencies and buying organizations of the us government 

we are subject to certain unique business risks as a result of supplying equipment and services to the us government in addition government contracts contain unfavorable termination provisions and are subject to modification and audit 

companies engaged in supplying defenserelated equipment and services to us government agencies are subject to business risks specific to the defense industry these risks include the ability of the us government to unilaterally 

 

  

  

  

 most of our us government contracts can be terminated by the us government either for its convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the contract termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination termination for default provisions provide for the contractor to be liable for excess costs incurred by the us government in procuring undelivered items from another source 

  

on contracts where the price is based on cost the us government may review our costs and performance as well as our accounting and general business practices based on the results of such audits the us government may adjust our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs in addition under us government purchasing regulations some of our costs including most financing costs amortization of intangible assets portions of research and development costs and certain marketing expenses may not be subject to reimbursement 

in addition to these us government contract risks we are at times required to obtain approval from us government agencies to export our products additionally we are not permitted to export some of our products a determination by the us government that we failed to receive required approvals or licenses could eliminate or restrict our ability to sell our products outside the united states and the penalties that could be imposed by the us government for failure to comply with these laws could be significant 

certain of our divisions and subsidiaries have been subject to a pricing review by the dod office of inspector general 

five of our divisions and subsidiaries have been the subject of a dod office of inspector general review of our records for the purchase of determining whether the dod’s various buying offices within the defense logistics agency had negotiated “fair and reasonable” prices for certain sole source spare parts purchased from those divisions and subsidiaries during fiscal years 2002 through 2004 on february 28 2006 we received a copy of the inspector general’s final report dated february 23 2006 and on april 19 2006 the inspector general issued its final report dated february 23 2006 and made public a redacted version thereof the report recommends i that the defense logistics agency request that those five subsidiaries and divisions voluntarily refund in the aggregate 26 million of allegedly overpriced parts and ii that defense logistics agency contracting officers reevaluate their procedures for determining the reasonableness of pricing for sole source spare parts purchased from those divisions and subsidiaries and seek to develop strategic supplier alliances with those divisions and subsidiaries 

the company’s position has been and continues to be that our pricing has been fair and reasonable and that there is no legal basis for the amount suggested as a refund by the inspector general in its report in response to the report we offered reasons why we disagree with the inspector general’s overall analysis the defense logistics agency has requested additional information from the company and the company’s position on the voluntary refund the company has responded to such request 

in february 2006 the defense logistics agency made a request to initiate discussions regarding future pricing and developing an acquisition strategy that will mutually strengthen transdigm and the defense logistics agency’s business relationship the parties have discussed and are considering future purchase approaches but negotiations regarding strategic supplier alliances or any specific approach have not yet commenced but may occur at a later date as a result of those negotiations it is possible that the divisions and subsidiaries subject to the pricing review will enter into strategic supplier alliances with the defense logistics agency it is likely that in connection with any strategic supplier alliance the defense logistics agency will seek prices for parts based on cost or may seek volume discounts or other favorable pricing andor the applicable division or subsidiary may agree to cost or pricing justification or appropriate discounts it is also possible that the dod may seek alternative sources of supply for such parts 

the entry into strategic supplier alliances or a decision by the dod to pursue alternative sources of supply for our sole source parts could reduce the amount of revenue we derive from and the profitability of certain of our supply arrangements with certain agencies and buying organizations of the us government 

see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—recent developments” for additional information with respect to the pricing review 

  

our business may be adversely affected if we would lose our government or industry approvals or if more stringent government regulations are enacted or if industry oversight is increased 

the aerospace industry is highly regulated in the united states and in other countries in order to sell our components we and the components we manufacture must be certified by the faa the dod and similar agencies in foreign countries and by individual manufacturers if new and more stringent government regulations are adopted or if industry oversight increases we might incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or heightened industry oversight in addition if material authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended our business would be adversely affected 

our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health harm our ability to react to changes to our business and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness including the notes 

we have a significant amount of indebtedness as of september 30 2006 our total indebtedness was approximately 925 million excluding unused commitments under our new revolving loan facility with an aggregate of 650 million outstanding under transdigm inc’s senior secured credit facility or the new senior secured credit facility and an aggregate 275 million of principal amount of transdigm inc’s 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes or the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes under the indenture governing such notes or indenture 

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness our substantial debt could also have other important consequences for example it could 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition all of our debt under the new senior secured credit facility which includes a 650 million term loan facility and a revolving loan facility of 150 million will bear interest at floating rates accordingly in the event that interest rates increase our debt service expense will also increase in order to reduce the floating interest rate risk the company entered into an interest rate swap in june 2006 for fixed interest rates on 187 million of the new senior secured credit facility this interest rate swap will decrease to 170 million on september 23 2007 and to 150 million on september 23 2008 through june 23 2009 

we cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt including the notes and to meet our other obligations if we do not have sufficient earnings we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or sell more securities none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do 

to service our indebtedness we will require a significant amount of cash our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could harm our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make payments on our indebtedness including the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes and amounts borrowed under the new senior secured credit facility and to fund our operations will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future which to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

  

we cannot assure you however that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all or that future borrowings will be available to us under the new senior secured credit facility or otherwise in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness including the amounts borrowed under the new senior secured credit facility and the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes or to fund our other liquidity needs if we cannot service our debt we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying capital investments selling assets restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital we cannot assure you that any of these remedies could if necessary be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants which could further restrict our business operations the terms of existing or future debt instruments the indenture and the new senior secured credit facility may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives in addition any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms and would otherwise adversely affect the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes 

the terms of the new senior secured credit facility and the indenture may restrict our current and future operations particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions 

the new senior secured credit facility and the indenture contain restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the new senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indenture and may limit their ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests the new senior secured credit facility and indenture include covenants restricting among other things the ability of td group transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the new senior secured credit facility and transdigm inc and its subsidiaries in the case of the indenture to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the new senior secured credit facility or the indenture if any such default occurs the lenders under the new senior secured credit facility and the holders of the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder to be immediately due and payable the lenders under the new senior secured credit facility also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings in addition following an event of default under the new senior secured credit facility the lenders under that facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which includes our available cash and they will also have the right to prevent us from making 

  

debt service payments on the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes if the debt under the new senior secured credit facility or the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes were to be accelerated we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes and our other debt 

we are dependent on our highly trained employees and any work stoppage or difficulty hiring similar employees could adversely affect our business 

because our products are complicated and highly engineered we depend on an educated and trained workforce there is substantial competition for skilled personnel in the aircraft component industry and we could be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled employees we may not be able to fill new positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover or attract and retain qualified personnel 

as of september 30 2006 we had approximately 1400 employees approximately 9 of our employees were represented by the united steelworkers union approximately 4 were represented by the united automobile aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america and approximately 6 were represented by the international brotherhood of electrical workers collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire in april 2008 november 2008 and may 2009 respectively although we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory we cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory renewal of these collective bargaining agreements or that our employee relations will remain stable because we maintain a relatively small inventory of finished goods any work stoppage could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide products to our customers 

our business is dependent on the availability of certain components and raw materials that we buy from suppliers 

our business is affected by the price and availability of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our components our business therefore could be adversely impacted by factors affecting our 

suppliers such as the destruction of our suppliers’ facilities or their distribution infrastructure a work stoppage or strike by our suppliers’ employees or the failure of our suppliers to provide materials of the requisite quality or by increased costs of such raw materials or components if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers because we maintain a relatively small inventory of raw materials and component parts our business could be adversely affected if we were unable to obtain these raw materials and components from our suppliers in the quantities we require or on favorable terms although we believe in most cases that we could identify alternative suppliers or alternative raw materials or component parts the lengthy and expensive faa and oem certification processes associated with aerospace products could prevent efficient replacement of a supplier raw material or component part 

we are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations and we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under such environmental laws and regulations 

our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern among other things discharges of pollutants into the air and water and the handling storage and disposal of hazardous materials we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and sanctions and third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws relevant common law or the environmental permits required for our operations 

pursuant to certain environmental laws a current or previous owner or operator of a contaminated site may be held liable for the entire cost of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous materials at such property whether or not the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of any hazardous materials persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials also may be held liable for such costs at a disposal or treatment site regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by them contaminants have been detected at some of our present and former sites principally in connection with historical operations 

  

and investigations andor cleanups have been undertaken by us or by former owners of the sites we also receive inquiries and notices of potential liability with respect to offsite disposal facilities from time to time although we are not aware of any sites for which material obligations exist the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations could result in significant liability 

we intend to pursue future acquisitions our business may be adversely affected if we cannot consummate acquisitions on satisfactory terms or if we cannot effectively integrate acquired operations 

a significant portion of our growth has occurred through acquisitions any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions we intend to pursue acquisitions that we believe will present opportunities consistent with our overall business strategy however we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates to purchase or we may be unable to acquire desired businesses or assets on economically acceptable terms in addition we may not be able to raise the money necessary to complete future acquisitions in addition acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect 

we regularly engage in discussions with respect to potential acquisition and investment opportunities if we consummate an acquisition our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly future acquisitions could likely result in the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest and amortization expenses or periodic impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets as well as significant charges relating to integration costs 

in addition we may not be able to successfully integrate any business we acquire into our existing business the successful integration of new businesses depends on our ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs the successful integration of future acquisitions may also require substantial attention from our senior management and the management of the acquired business which could decrease the time that they have to service and attract customers and develop new products and services in addition because we may actively pursue a number of opportunities simultaneously we may encounter unforeseen expenses complications and delays including difficulties in employing sufficient staff and maintaining operational and management oversight 

we have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets which may never generate the returns we expect 

our acquisitions have resulted in significant increases in identifiable intangible assets and goodwill identifiable intangible assets which primarily include trademarks trade names trade secrets license agreements and technology were approximately 2260 million at september 30 2006 representing approximately 159 of our total assets goodwill recognized in accounting for the mergers and other recent acquisitions was approximately 8778 million at september 30 2006 representing approximately 619 of our total assets we may never realize the full value of our identifiable intangible assets and goodwill and to the extent we were to determine that our identifiable intangible assets andour goodwill were impaired within the meaning of applicable accounting regulations we would be required to writeoff the amount of any impairment 

we face significant competition 

we operate in a highly competitive global industry and compete against a number of companies including divisions of larger companies some of which have significantly greater resources than we do and therefore may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we can competitors in our product lines are both us and foreign companies and range in size from divisions of large public corporations to small privately 

  

held entities we believe that our ability to compete depends on high product performance consistent high quality short leadtime and timely delivery competitive pricing superior customer service and support and continued certification under customer quality requirements and assurance programs we may have to adjust the prices of some of our products to stay competitive 

we could be adversely affected if one of our components causes an aircraft to crash 

our operations expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we have designed manufactured or serviced while we believe that our liability insurance is adequate to protect us from future products liability claims it may not be adequate we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost any such liability not covered by insurance or for which third party indemnification is not available could result in significant liability to us 

in addition a crash caused by one of our components could also damage our reputation for quality products we believe our customers consider safety and reliability as key criteria in selecting a provider of aircraft components if a crash were to be caused by one of our components or if we were otherwise to fail to maintain a satisfactory record of safety and reliability our ability to retain and attract customers may be materially adversely affected 

our stock prices may be volatile and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 

there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities which is unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities these broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the purchase price due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects including possible changes due to the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry and other factors such as fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering which could cause shortterm swings in profit margins 

future sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our share price 

a substantial amount of our outstanding stock is held by affiliates and not currently traded in the public market while the sale of these shares into the open market may be limited by applicable regulations the stockholders of these shares are not bound by any contractual obligations not to sell thus our existing stockholders may sell additional shares of common stock into the public markets in addition we may sell additional shares of common stock into the public markets or issue convertible debt securities to raise capital in the future the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public markets or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities to raise capital at a time and price that we deem appropriate 

our principal stockholder and its affiliates will be able to influence matters requiring stockholder approval and could discourage the purchase of our outstanding shares at a premium 

warburg pincus through its control of td group llc is deemed to beneficially own approximately 70 of our outstanding common stock as of november 1 2006 this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying preventing or deterring a change in control of our company could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale or merger of our company and may negatively affect the market price of our common stock these transactions might include proxy contests tender offers mergers or other purchase of common stock that could give you the opportunity to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for shares of our common stock 

  

as a result of warburg pincus’ control of td group llc and representation on our board of directors warburg pincus will be able to influence all affairs and actions of our company including matters requiring stockholder approval such as the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions the interest of warburg pincus may differ from the interest of our other stockholders for example warburg pincus could oppose a third party offer to acquire us that you might consider attractive and the third party may not be able or willing to proceed unless warburg pincus supports the offer in addition if our board of directors supports a transaction requiring an amendment to our certificate of incorporation warburg pincus through its control of td group llc is currently in a position to defeat any required stockholder approval of the proposed amendment if our board of directors supports an acquisition of us by means of a merger or similar transaction the vote of warburg pincus as the managing member of td group llc alone is currently sufficient to approve or block the transaction under delaware law in each of these cases and in similar situations you may disagree with warburg pincus as to whether the action opposed or supported by warburg pincus is in the best interest of our stockholders 

we are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements since we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the nyse rules and as a result you will not have the protections afforded by these corporate governance requirements 

because td group llc controls more than 50 of the voting power of our common stock we are considered to be a “controlled company” for the purposes of the nyse listing requirements under the nyse rules a “controlled company” may elect not to comply with certain nyse corporate government requirements including 1 the requirement that a majority of our board of directors consist of independent directors 2 the requirement that the nominating and corporate governance committee of our board of directors be composed entirely of independent directors and 3 the requirement that the compensation committee of our board of directors be composed entirely of independent directors given that td group llc controls a majority of the voting power of our common stock we are permitted and have elected to opt out of compliance with certain nyse corporate governance requirements accordingly you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the nyse corporate governance requirements 

our corporate documents and delaware law contain certain provisions that could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable for example our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 149600000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock without stockholder approval the board of directors has the authority to attach special rights including voting and dividend rights to this preferred stock with these rights holders of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us in addition our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered board of directors whereby directors serve for threeyear terms with approximately onethird of the directors coming up for reelection each year having a staggered board will make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of our board of directors through a proxy contest which may be a necessary step in an acquisition of us that is not favored by our board of directors our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75 of the voting power of our issued and outstanding capital stock voting together as a single class is required for the alteration amendment or repeal of certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation including the provisions authorizing a staggered board and certain provisions of our amended and restated bylaws including the provisions relating to our stockholders’ ability to call special meetings notice provisions for stockholder business to be conducted at an annual meeting requests for stockholder lists and corporate records nomination and removal of directors and filling of vacancies on our board of directors 

we are also subject to the antitakeover provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law under these provisions if anyone becomes an “interested stockholder” we may not enter into a “business 

  

combination” with that person for three years without special approval which could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change of control for purposes of section 203 “interested stockholder” means generally someone owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years subject to certain exceptions as described in section 203 td group llc warburg pincus and their affiliates do not constitute “interested stockholders” for the purposes of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law 

we do not intend to pay regular cash dividends on our stock 

we do not anticipate declaring or paying regular cash dividends on our common stock or any other equity security in the foreseeable future the amounts that may be available to us to pay cash dividends are restricted under out debt and other agreements any payment of cash dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our results of operations earnings capital requirements financial condition future prospects contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors therefore you should not rely on dividend income from shares of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with “selected consolidated financial data” and td group’s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report references to “transdigm” “the company” “we” “us” “our” and similar references refer to td group transdigm inc and transdigm inc’s subsidiaries unless the context otherwise indicates the following discussion may contain predictions estimates and other forwardlooking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties including those discussed under the heading entitled “risk factors” and elsewhere in this report these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 

overview 

we believe we are a leading global designer producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers some of our more significant product offerings substantially all of which are ultimately provided to endusers in the aerospace industry include ignition systems and components gear pumps mechanicalelectromechanical actuators and controls nicad batterieschargers power conditioning devices holdopen rods and locking devices engineered connectors engineered latches and cockpit security devices lavatory hardware and components specialized acdc electric motors and specialized valving each of these product offerings consists of many individual products that are typically customized to meet the needs of a particular aircraft platform or customer 

for fiscal year 2006 we generated net sales of 4352 million and net income of 251 million in addition for fiscal year 2006 our ebitda was 1343 million or 309 of net sales our ebitda as defined was 1944 million or 447 of net sales and our capital expenditures were 83 million or 19 of net sales see “ebitda and ebitda as defined” below for certain information regarding ebitda and ebitda as defined including a reconciliation of ebitda and ebitda as defined to net income 

we estimate that over 90 of our net sales for fiscal year 2006 were generated by proprietary products for which we own the design these products are generally approved and certified by airframe manufacturers who often certify only one manufacturer’s component design for a specific application on an aircraft government agencies andor the faa and similar entities or agencies in addition for fiscal year 2006 we estimate that we generated approximately 75 of our net sales from products for which we are the sole source provider 

most of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue once our parts are designed into and sold as original equipment on an aircraft we generate net sales from recurring aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft this installed base and our sole source provider position generate a longterm stream of aftermarket revenues over the estimated 30year life of an individual aircraft we estimate that approximately 60 of our net sales in fiscal year 2006 were generated from aftermarket sales the vast majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets these aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and been more stable than sales to oems 

in fiscal year 2006 our top two customers accounted for approximately 19 of our net sales and during this same period our top ten customers accounted for approximately 48 of our net sales however our components are ultimately used on a large diverse installed base of aircraft and therefore we are not overly dependent on any single airframe produced by any of our customers or other ultimate endusers of our products 

  

in the commercial aerospace sector which generated approximately 72 of our net sales for fiscal year 2006 we sell to distributors of aftermarket components as well as directly to commercial airlines aircraft maintenance facilities systems suppliers and aircraft and engine oems in addition for fiscal year 2006 approximately 24 of our net sales were attributable to the defense aerospace sector with approximately 7 of our overall net sales for this period being attributable to various agencies and buying organizations of the us government net sales to the defense sector are generated primarily through sales to the united states and foreign militaries brokers distributors and defense oems the remaining portion of our net sales in fiscal year 2006 or approximately 4 of our net sales during this period were derived from industries with similar niche engineered product characteristics such as the mining military ground vehicle and power generation industries 

recent developments 

financing transaction and intercompany merger 

on may 25 2006 we commenced a tender offer to purchase for cash any and all of our outstanding 8 3  8  senior subordinated notes and in connection therewith we solicited consents to amend the indenture governing such notes to among other things eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants and eliminate or modify certain events of default on june 23 2006 we closed the tender offer and consent solicitation for the 8 3  8  senior subordinated notes in connection with the closing we purchased all of the issued and outstanding 8 3  8  senior subordinated notes that were validly tendered totaling 3997 million in aggregate principal amount on august 7 2006 we redeemed all of the 8 3  8  senior subordinated notes that remained outstanding after the consummation of the tender offer 

in addition simultaneously with the closing of the tender offer and consent solicitation for the 8 3  8  senior subordinated notes we entered into the new senior secured credit facility which consists of a 650 million term loan facility all of which was funded at the closing of such financing transaction and a revolving loan facility with a total borrowing availability of 150 million none of which was drawn at the closing of such financing transaction 

on june 23 2006 simultaneously with the consummation of the other transactions described above we consummated the offering and sale of the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes we used the net proceeds from the offering and sale of the 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes together with the initial borrowings under the new senior secured credit facility and a portion of our existing cash balances to fund 1 the repayment of the entire 2884 million of principal amount outstanding under our former senior secured credit facility 2 the repayment of the entire 200 million of principal amount outstanding under the td group’s outstanding loan facility 3 the purchase of all of our 8 3  8  senior subordinated notes that were tendered in connection with the tender offer for such notes totaling 3997 million 4 the payment of accrued and unpaid interest on all such indebtedness and 5 the payment of all premiums and transaction expenses associated therewith 

in an effort to simplify our organizational structure on june 23 2006 td finance corporation a whollyowned subsidiary of transdigm inc was merged with and into transdigm inc with transdigm inc continuing as the surviving corporation td finance corporation did not conduct any operations and did not have assets other than an intercompany note receivable from transdigm holdings in addition on june 26 2006 transdigm holdings was merged with and into transdigm inc with transdigm inc continuing as the surviving corporation transdigm holdings did not conduct any operations and did not have any significant assets other than its ownership interest in transdigm inc accordingly transdigm inc is a whollyowned subsidiary of td group 

td group’s initial public offering 

on march 20 2006 certain stockholders of td group and certain members of our management sold an aggregate of 12597756 shares of td group’s common stock in the initial public offering at a price of 2100 per share td group did not offer any shares of its common stock for sale in the initial public offering and td 

  

group did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of such shares by the selling stockholders as a result of the initial public offering td group’s common stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “tdg” 

dividend and bonus payments 

on november 10 2005 td group closed on a 200 million loan facility in connection with the closing of that loan facility transdigm inc paid a cash dividend of approximately 980 million to transdigm holdings and made bonus payments of approximately 62 million to certain members of our management which bonus payments were in addition to amounts paid to certain members of our management under our deferred compensation plans as described below transdigm holdings used all of the proceeds received from transdigm inc to pay a cash dividend to td group on november 10 2005 td group used the net proceeds received from its loan facility of approximately 1938 million together with substantially all of the proceeds received from the dividend payment from transdigm holdings to 

 

  

  

 in connection with the distributions under the rollover deferred compensation plan the board of directors of td group approved the termination of the rollover deferred compensation plan with such termination becoming effective on november 10 2005 the management deferred compensation plan was terminated effective as of december 16 2005 in connection with our adoption of a new deferred compensation plan which is described in more detail elsewhere in this report 

government pricing review 

certain parts sold by five of our divisions and subsidiaries to the dod through various buying agencies of the defense logistics agency have been the subject of a pricing review by the dod office of inspector general the pricing review examined whether the various buying offices within the defense logistics agency had negotiated “fair and reasonable” prices for certain sole source spare parts purchased from those divisions and subsidiaries during fiscal years 2002 through 2004 on february 28 2006 we received a copy of the inspector general’s final report dated february 23 2006 and on april 19 2006 the inspector general made public a redacted version thereof the report recommends i that the defense logistics agency request that those five subsidiaries and divisions voluntarily refund in the aggregate approximately 26 million for allegedly overpriced parts and ii that defense logistics agency contracting officers reevaluate their procedures for determining the reasonableness of pricing for sole source spare parts purchased from those divisions and subsidiaries and seek to develop strategic supplier alliances with those divisions and subsidiaries 

we believe that the pricing review is part of a continuing effort by the inspector general to monitor and evaluate prices paid to defense contractors for sole source spare parts the report is consistent with reports issued with respect to sole source spare parts supplied by other companies and like those other reports it advocates the 

  

negotiation of strategic supplier alliances incorporating prices for parts based on cost rather than based on prices of comparable commercial parts or other methods we believe that our pricing of spare parts comports with the regulations applicable to contracts with agencies of the federal government nonetheless the report recommends that the defense logistics agency request that the applicable divisions and subsidiaries of transdigm inc voluntarily refund in the aggregate approximately 26 million for allegedly overpriced parts and negotiate strategic supplier alliances incorporating costbased prices for future defense logistics agency purchases of sole source spare parts 

the company’s position has been and continues to be that our pricing has been fair and reasonable and that there is no legal basis for the amount suggested as a refund by the inspector general in its report in response to the report we offered reasons why we disagree with the inspector general’s overall analysis the defense logistics agency has requested additional information from the company and the company’s position on the voluntary refund the company has responded to such request 

in february 2006 the defense logistics agency made a request to initiate discussions regarding future pricing and develop an acquisition strategy that will mutually strengthen transdigm’s and the defense logistics agency’s business relationship the parties have discussed and are considering future purchasing approaches but negotiations with the defense logistics agency regarding strategic supplier alliances or any specific approach have not yet commenced but may occur at a later date as a result of those negotiations it is possible that the divisions and subsidiaries subject to the pricing review will enter into strategic supplier alliances with the defense logistics agency it is likely in connection with any strategic supplier alliance the defense logistics agency will seek prices for parts based on cost or may seek volume discounts or other favorable pricing andor the applicable division or subsidiary may agree to cost or pricing justification or appropriate discounts it is also possible that the dod may seek alternative sources of supply for such parts 

the entry into strategic supplier alliances or a decision by the dod to pursue alternative sources of supply for our sole source parts could reduce the amount of revenue we derive from and the profitability of certain of our supply arrangements with certain agencies and buying organizations of the us government while management believes that the entry into strategic supplier alliances with the defense logistics agency will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity or capital resources there is no means to determine the outcome of any future negotiations or discussions at this time

 because of these limitations ebitda and ebitda as defined should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business management compensates for these limitations by not viewing ebitda or ebitda as defined in isolation and specifically by using other gaap measures such as net income net sales and operating profit to measure our operating performance neither ebitda nor ebitda as defined is a measurement of financial performance under gaap and neither should be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations determined in accordance with gaap and our calculation of ebitda and ebitda as defined may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

trend information 

the commercial aerospace industry is impacted by the health of the global economy and geopolitical events around the world the commercial aerospace industry suffered after the events of september 11 2001 and the subsequent downturn in the global economy the sars epidemic and more recently from rising fuel prices and the conflicts in the middle east recently the industry has shown signs of strengthening with increases in rpms although rising fuel prices conflicts in the middle east major airline financial distress and the risk of additional terrorist activity have tempered the recovery 

our presence in both the commercial transport and military sectors of the aerospace industry may mitigate the impact on our business of any specific industry risk we service a diversified customer base in the commercial and military aerospace industry and we provide components to a diverse installed base of aircraft which mitigates our exposure to any individual airframe platform at times declines in sales in any one sector 

  

have been offset by increased sales in another for example the commercial transport sector that we serve was adversely affected by the events of september 11 2001 but the downturn in that market was partially offset by an increase in military aircraft spending that resulted from the military engagements in afghanistan and iraq and the war on terrorism 

there is industry consensus that conditions in the commercial transport market sector have improved recently we are experiencing increased activity in the large commercial oem sector aircraft with 100 or more seats driven by order announcements by the boeing company and airbus sas we expect this level of activity to continue in the near future 

rpms are recovering to preseptember 11 2001 levels or higher and absent any disruptive events we are hopeful our aftermarket business will continue to follow this trend 

in recent years defense spending has reached historic highs due in part to the military engagements in afghanistan and iraq and the war on terrorism after several recent quarters of continued growth we have recently seen our military business level off our military business fluctuates from year to year and is dependent to a degree on government budget constraints the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts we anticipate that military related sales of our types of products will experience modest if any growth over the current high levels 

the aerospace industry is cyclical and fragmented there are many shortterm factors including inventory corrections unannounced changes in order patterns and mergers and acquisitions that can cause shortterm disruptions in our weekly monthly and quarterly shipment patterns as compared to previous quarters and the same periods in prior years to normalize for shortterm fluctuations we tend to look at our performance over several quarters or years of activity rather than discreet shortterm periods as such it can be difficult to determine longerterm trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons 

there are also fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering and delivery requests from quartertoquarter due to the differences between the profitability of our products sold to oem and aftermarket customers variation in product mix can cause shortterm swings in gross margins again in many instances these are timing events between quarters and must be balanced with macro aerospace industry indicators 

we believe that the boeing company and airbus sas are in a period of increased production and we think we are well positioned on the new aircraft platforms recently announced having significant content on these new aircraft platforms could negatively impact our margin over the near term given that oem revenues tend to produce lower gross margins than aftermarket revenues but should positively impact our business in future years as replacement aftermarket parts will be required to service these new aircrafts 

although the aerospace industry is in a cycle of increased production our business would be adversely affected by significant changes in the us or global economy historically aircraft travel as measured by rpms generally correlates to economic conditions and a reduction in aircraft travel would result in a decrease in the need for aftermarket parts which in turn would adversely affect our business 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations however investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 

  

we have identified the following as the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial status depends these critical policies were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments our most critical accounting policies are as follows 

revenue recognition and related allowances substantially all of our revenues are recognized based upon shipment of products to the customer at which time title and risk of loss passes to the customer substantially all sales are made pursuant to firm fixedprice purchase orders received from customers provisions for returns uncollectible accounts and the cost of repairs under contract warranty provisions are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are principally based on historical results modified as appropriate by the most current information available we have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of such allowances however due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process it is possible that actual results may vary from the estimates and the differences could be material 

management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable and customer creditworthiness the allowance also incorporates a provision for the estimated impact of disputes with customers management’s estimate of the allowance amounts that are necessary includes amounts for specifically identified losses and a general amount for estimated losses based on historical information the determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to significant levels of judgment and estimation by management if circumstances change or economic conditions deteriorate management may need to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 

the company provides limited warranties in connection with the sale of its products the warranty period for products sold varies throughout the company’s operations ranging from 90 days to five years however the warranty period for the majority of the company’s sales generally does not exceed one year in addition certain contracts with distributors contain right of return provisions the company accrues for estimated returns and warranty claims based on knowledge of product performance issues and excess inventories provided by its customers and industry sources the company also provides a general amount based on historical results historically actual product returns and warranty claims have not differed materially from the estimates originally established 

inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost of inventories is determined by the average cost and the firstin firstout fifo methods because the company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be inservice for 30 or more years it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use provision for potentially obsolete or slowmoving inventory is made based on our analysis of inventory levels past usage and future sales forecasts although management believes that the company’s estimates of obsolete and slowmoving inventory are reasonable actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future in addition in accordance with industry practice all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year 

intangible assets the mergers and other acquisitions have resulted in significant amounts of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights or if the intangible asset can be sold transferred licensed or exchanged regardless of the company’s intent to do so goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and under financial accounting standards board statement no 142 “ goodwill and other intangible assets ” “sfas 142” are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates the determination of undiscounted cash flows is based on the company’s strategic plans and longrange planning forecasts the revenue growth rates included in the plans are based on industry and company specific data the profit margin assumptions included in the plans are projected based on the current cost structure and anticipated cost changes if different assumptions were used in these plans the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different and the recognition of an impairment loss might be required intangible assets such as goodwill trademarks and trade names that have an indefinite useful life are not amortized all other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 

  

stock options and deferred compensation plans effective with the consummation of the mergers the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 123 “ accounting for stockbased compensation” which requires the measurement of compensation expense under the stock option plan to be based on the estimated fair values of the awards under the plan on the grant dates and amortizes the expense over the options’ vesting periods in addition the company accounts for the cost of the deferred compensation plans of td group in accordance with opinion no 12 of the accounting principles board which requires the cost of deferred compensation arrangements to be accrued over the service period of the related employees in a systematic and rational manner 

purchase accounting mergers and acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method accordingly fair value adjustments to the company’s assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in its consolidated financial statements from the effective date of merger or acquisition we generally use thirdparty appraisals to assist us in determining the fair value adjustments

the following tables set forth for the periods indicated certain operating data of the company including presentation of the amounts as a percentage of net sales amounts in thousands 

 

 fiscal year ended september 30 2006 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2005 

net sales net sales increased by 609 million or 163 to 4352 million for fiscal year 2006 from 3743 million for fiscal year 2005 sales growth excluding acquisitions was 400 million and represented a 107 increase over the prior year the organic sales growth was primarily due to i an increase of 209 million of commercial aftermarket sales resulting from the continuing recovery in the commercial aerospace market and the strength of our proprietary products and market position as well as new business initiatives and 

  

ii an increase of 172 million of commercial oem sales primarily resulting from the increase in production rates for the boeing company and airbus sas and related oem system suppliers as well as the business jet market partially offsetting the increase in organic sales was a slight decrease in military sales the remaining 209 million increase resulted from the acquisitions of skurka fluid regulators and a motor product line in fiscal 2005 and electramotion and sweeney in fiscal 2006 

cost of sales  cost of sales increased by 239 million or 126 to 2139 million for fiscal year 2006 from 1900 from fiscal year 2005 cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased approximately 17 percentage points to 491 for fiscal year 2006 from 508 for fiscal year 2005 the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to increase volume associated with the higher net sales of 609 million discussed above partially offset by a reduction in acquisition related costs of 16 million or 06 of net sales the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was primarily due to productivity improvements and the reduction in acquisition related costs partially offset by negative product mix from higher oem sales 

selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased by 94 million or 241 to 483 million for fiscal year 2006 from 389 million for fiscal year 2005 the increase was due to i a onetime special bonus of 62 million or 14 of net sales paid to certain members of management ii the costs associated with higher net sales discussed above and iii nonrecurring initial public offing costs of 27 million or 06 of net sales these increases were partially offset by i reversal of previously recorded charges of 38 million or 09 of net sales resulting from the termination in fiscal 2006 of the rollover deferred compensation plan and management deferred compensation plan and ii the decrease of 32 million due to lower compensation expense recorded under the new management deferred compensation plan adopted in december 2005 

selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 111 for fiscal year 2006 from 104 for the comparable period last year primarily due to the factors described above 

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles decreased by 16 million to 62 million for fiscal year 2006 from 78 million for fiscal year 2005 the decrease was primarily due to order backlog that was recorded in accounting for acquisitions made in fiscal 2005 that was subsequently fully amortized in fiscal 2006 

refinancing costs refinancing costs represent a onetime charge that was recorded in june 2006 as a result of the refinancing of transdigm’s entire debt structure the charge of 486 million consisted of the premium of 256 million paid to redeem our 8 3  8  senior subordinated notes and the writeoff of 229 million of debt issue costs associated with our former senior credit facility our 8 3  8  senior subordinated notes and the td group loan facility and other expenses of 01 million 

income from operations operating income decreased by 194 million or 141 to 1182 million for fiscal year 2006 from 1376 million for fiscal year 2005 primarily due to the refinancing costs of 486 million partially offset by other factors described above 

interest expense  interest expense decreased 35 million or 44 to 767 million for fiscal year 2006 from 803 million for fiscal year 2005 the net decrease was primarily the result of our refinancing of our debt structure during fiscal 2006 as a result of the refinancing despite an increase in our average level of outstanding borrowings to approximately 904 million during fiscal 2006 from 891 million during fiscal 2005 the average interest rate decreased to 82 during fiscal 2006 from 86 during fiscal 2005 see “liquidity and capital resources” below 

income taxes  income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was 394 for fiscal year 2006 and was comparable to 395 for fiscal year 2005 

net income net income decreased 96 million or 276 to 251 million for fiscal year 2006 compared to 347 million for fiscal year 2005 primarily as a result of the refinancing and other factors referred to above 

  

fiscal year ended september 30 2005 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2004 

net sales net sales increased by 736 million or 245 to 3743 million for fiscal year 2005 from 3007 million for fiscal year 2004 the increase is due to i net sales attributable to the acquisition of avionic in july 2004 skurka in december 2004 fluid regulators in january 2005 and a motor product line in june 2005 which we refer to collectively as the acquisitions totaling 400 million ii an increase in commercial oem net sales of 145 million resulting from the higher production rates for the boeing company airbus sas and regional and business jet markets iii an increase in military shipments of 95 million primarily due to the continued spending by the us government resulting in part from the conflicts in the middle east and iv an increase in commercial aftermarket sales of 96 million due to the continuing recovery of the commercial aerospace market 

cost of sales cost of sales increased by 258 million or 157 to 1900 million for fiscal year 2005 from 1642 million for fiscal year 2004 the increase was primarily attributable to the cost of the higher net sales of 736 discussed previously partially offset by the 185 million charge or 61 of net sales that was recorded in fiscal year 2004 that resulted in increased cost of sales due to inventory purchase price accounting charges pertaining to the writeup of inventory associated with the mergers that occurred in fiscal year 2003 

the improvement in cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales in fiscal year 2005 when compared to fiscal year 2004 was primarily due to the 185 million charge recorded in fiscal year 2004 that is discussed above partially offset by less favorable product mix ie higher oem shipments in fiscal year 2005 and the impact of lower margin revenues from the acquisitions 

selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased by 77 million or 248 to 389 million for fiscal year 2005 from 312 million for fiscal year 2004 primarily due to the higher net sales discussed above selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were the same for both fiscal years 

amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles decreased by 26 million to 77 million for fiscal year 2005 from 103 million for fiscal year 2004 the decrease was primarily due to the reduction of 31 million in order backlog amortization during fiscal year 2005 during fiscal year 2004 54 million of order backlog that was recorded in accounting for the mergers was fully amortized this decrease was partially offset by an increase in amortization expense of approximately 05 million on the additional identifiable intangible assets recognized in connection with the acquisitions 

interest expense interest expense increased by 56 million or 75 to 803 million for fiscal year 2005 from 747 million for fiscal year 2004 due to i an increase of 31 million in interest expense on the 12 senior unsecured promissory notes resulting from the semiannual compounding of the accrued and unpaid interest on such notes since july 2003 and ii an increase in the interest rates on borrowings under the former senior secured credit facility resulting in an additional 34 million of interest expense in fiscal year 2005 this increase was offset by certain other items which resulted in a reduction in interest expense of 09 million 

income tax provision income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes was 395 for fiscal year 2005 compared to 329 for fiscal year 2004 the increase in the income tax provision as a percentage of income before income taxes is largely due to two items i the reduction in the benefit from foreign sales and ii a change in the ohio tax law the reduction in the foreign sales benefit was due to higher income before income taxes in fiscal year 2005 and a change in the federal extraterritorial law that phases out the foreign sales deduction by 2007 our reduced benefit from foreign sales increased our effective tax rate by 44 the change in the ohio tax law became effective on july 1 2005 and replaced the income tax with a commercial activity tax by 2010 as a result of this law change our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards was limited therefore adjustments were made to noncurrent deferred income tax assets and liabilities these adjustments resulted in a charge to income tax expense of 13 million or a 23 increase to the effective tax rate 

net income net income increased 211 million or 1546 to 347 million for fiscal year 2005 compared to net income of 136 million for fiscal year 2004 

  

backlog 

as of september 30 2006 the company estimated its sales order backlog at 2513 million compared to an estimated sales order backlog of 2000 million as of september 30 2005 this increase in backlog of 513 million is due in part to the acquisitions of sweeney and electramotion discussed above totaling approximately 112 million the balance of the increase in sales order backlog is due to increases in orders across existing product lines in both the oem and aftermarket segments the majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of september 30 2006 are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months purchase orders may be subject to cancellation by the customer prior to shipment the level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of the company’s receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled accordingly the company’s backlog as of september 30 2006 may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period 

foreign operations 

although the company manufactures all of its products in the united states some components are purchased from foreign suppliers and a portion of the company’s products are resold to foreign endusers the company’s direct sales to foreign customers were approximately 1027 million 815 million and 699 million in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks including the impact of foreign government regulations currency fluctuations political uncertainties and differences in business practices there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on the business or market opportunities of the company within such governments’ countries furthermore there can be no assurance that the political cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to the company’s operations and growth strategy 

inflation 

many of the company’s raw materials and operating expenses are sensitive to the effects of inflation which could result in changing operating costs the effects of inflation on the company’s businesses during the fiscal years 2006 2005 and 2004 were not significant 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating activities the company generated 31 million of cash from operating activities during fiscal 2006 compared to 807 million generated during fiscal 2005 the decrease of 776 million is primarily due to i the payment of accrued interest of 627 million relating to the 12 senior unsecured promissory notes and 123 million relating to the td group loan facility ii the distributions to participants in our deferred compensation plans totaling approximately 260 million in connection with the distributions under the deferred compensation plans our board of directors approved the termination of the plans during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and iii the payment of a onetime special bonus to certain members of management of 62 million these decreases are partially offset by a 296 million increase in operating cash flows as a result of an increase in net sales and other factors described in “changes in results of operations” above 

we generated 807 million of cash from operating activities during fiscal year 2005 compared to 1111 million of cash generated from operating activities in fiscal year 2004 the decrease of 304 million in fiscal year 2005 is primarily due to the receipt of income tax refunds of 371 million during fiscal year 2004 resulting from the merger charge in the twelvemonth period ended september 30 2003 

investing activities cash used in investing activities increased to 353 million during fiscal 2006 from 205 million in fiscal 2005 the cash used in fiscal 2006 was for the acquisitions of electra motion and sweeney for 270 million and capital expenditures of 83 million 

  

cash used in investing activities decreased to 205 million during fiscal year 2005 compared to 776 million of cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2004 the cash used in fiscal year 2005 was primarily for i the acquisitions discussed previously of 632 million offset by the sale of marketable securities net of purchases of 506 million and ii capital expenditures of 80 million the cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2004 was primarily for the net purchase of marketable securities of 507 million and the acquisition of avionic for 215 million 

financing activities the company used 107 million of cash during fiscal 2006 compared to using 44 million of cash during fiscal 2005 the increase during fiscal 2006 is due to i the use of 45 million associated with the refinancing of the company’s entire debt structure in june 2006 see “impact of refinancing” below and ii the use of 200 million of cash in connection with the repayment of the 12 senior unsecured promissory notes in november 2005 partially offsetting these increases was the borrowing under the td group loan facility of 1938 million the company used 39 million of cash from financing activities during fiscal year 2004 primarily for the repayment of term loans and a license agreement 

impact of refinancing 

in june 2006 transdigm refinanced its entire debt structure in connection with the refinancing transdigm inc obtained a new senior secured credit facility the new senior secured credit facility consists of a 650 million term loan facility which was fully drawn at closing and a 150 million revolving loan facility of which 1488 million was available as of september 30 2006

contractual obligations 

the following is a summary of contractual cash obligations as of september 30 2006 in millions 

 

   in addition to the contractual obligations set forth above the company incurs capital expenditures for the purpose of maintaining and replacing existing equipment and facilities and from time to time for facility expansion capital expenditures totaled approximately 83 million 80 million and 54 million during fiscal 2006 2005 and fiscal 2004 respectively the company expects its capital expenditures in fiscal 2007 to be approximately 15 million and such expenditures are projected to increase moderately thereafter 

  

the company intends to pursue acquisitions that present opportunities consistent with the company’s business direction the company regularly engages in discussions with respect to potential acquisitions and investments however there can be no assurance that the company will be able to consummate an agreement with respect to any future acquisition the company’s acquisition strategy may require substantial capital and no assurance can be given that the company will be able to raise any necessary funds on acceptable terms or at all if the company incurs additional debt to finance acquisitions total interest expense will increase 

if the company has excess cash it may consider methods by which it can provide cash to its debt or equity holders through a dividend prepayment of indebtedness repurchase of stock or other means such activities will depend on prevailing market conditions the company’s liquidity requirements contractual restrictions and other factors the amounts involved may be material in addition the company may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so 

the company’s ability to make scheduled interest payments on or to refinance the company’s indebtedness or to fund nonacquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on the company’s ability to generate cash in the future this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond its control based on its current levels of operations and anticipated cost savings and operating improvements and absent any disruptive events management believes that internally generated funds and borrowings available under our revolving loan facility should provide sufficient resources to finance its operations nonacquisition related capital expenditures research and development efforts and longterm indebtedness obligations through at least fiscal 2007 there can be no assurance however that the company’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized on schedule or at all or that future borrowings will be available to the company under the new senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its indebtedness or to fund its other liquidity needs the company may need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness on or before maturity also to the extent the company accelerates its growth plans consummates acquisitions or has lower than anticipated sales or increases in expenses the company may also need to raise additional capital in particular increased working capital needs occur whenever the company consummates acquisitions or experiences strong incremental demand there can be no assurance that the company will be able to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend at september 30 2006 the company had borrowings under its new senior secured credit facility of 650 million that was subject to interest rate risk borrowings under the new senior secured credit facility bear interest at its option at a rate equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted libo rate for a one two three or sixmonth or to the extent available to each lender nine or twelve month interest period chosen by transdigm inc in each case plus an applicable margin percentage accordingly the company’s cash flows and earnings will be exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes resulting from variable rate borrowings under its new senior secured credit facility the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the annual interest costs under the new senior secured credit facility by approximately 65 million based on the amount of outstanding borrowings at september 30 2006 the weighted average interest rate on the 650 million of borrowings under the new senior secured credit facility on september 30 2006 was 739 

at september 30 2006 we had an agreement in place to swap variable interest rates on the new senior secured credit facility for fixed interest rates through june 23 2009 for the notional amount of 187 million which will decrease to 170 million on september 23 2007 and to 150 million on september 23 2008 through june 23 2009 the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement is adjusted at each balance sheet date with a corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income at september 30 2006 the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement was a liability of 29 million 

  

because the interest rates on borrowings under the new senior secured credit facility vary with market conditions the amount of outstanding borrowings under the new senior secured credit facility approximates the fair value of the indebtedness the fair value of the 275 million aggregate principal amount of the transdigm inc’s 7 3  4  senior subordinated notes is exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes the estimated fair value of such notes approximated 280 million at september 30 2006 based upon the quoted market rates
