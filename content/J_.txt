energy chemicals and resources 

ecr disposition 

on april 26 2019 jacobs completed the sale of its ecr business to worley for a purchase price of 34 billion consisting of i 28 billion in cash plus ii 582 million ordinary shares of worley subject to adjustments for changes in working capital and certain other items the ecr sale 

as a result of the ecr sale substantially all ecrrelated assets and liabilities were sold the disposal group and it was determined that the disposal group should be reported as discontinued operations in accordance with asc 21005 discontinued operations because their disposal represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results as such the financial results of the ecr business are reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings as discontinued operations for all periods presented for further discussion see note 16 sale of energy chemicals and resources ecr business to the consolidated financial statements 

significant customers 

the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government for each of the last three fiscal years 



given the percentage of total revenue derived directly from the us federal government the loss of us federal government agencies as customers could have a material adverse effect on the company in addition any or all of our government contracts could be terminated we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work or payment of our costs could be disallowed approximately 84 of revenue derived directly from the us federal government is in the cms segment for more information on risks relating to our government contracts see item 1a  risk factors 

contracts 

while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake our contracts generally fall into two broad categories costreimbursable and fixedprice the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the last three fiscal years 



page 15 

in accordance with industry practice most of our contracts including those with the us federal government are subject to termination at the discretion of the client which is discussed in greater detail in item 1a  risk factors  in such situations our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination 

costreimbursable contracts 

costreimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit the profit element may be in the form of a simple markup applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee or a combination of a markup and a fee the fee element can also take several forms the fee may be a fixed amount it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred or it may be an incentive fee based on targets milestones or performance factors defined in the contract 

fixedprice contracts 

fixedprice contracts include both “lump sum bid” contracts and “negotiated fixedprice” contracts under lump sum bid contracts we typically bid against competitors based on clientfurnished specifications this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period additionally it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients which is contrary to our relationshipbased business model accordingly lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract in contrast under a negotiated fixedprice contract we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client negotiated fixedprice contracts frequently exist in singleresponsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project thus although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us in our services contracts as well as construction however because of economies that may be realized during the contract term both negotiated fixedprice and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts the company carefully manages the risk inherent in these types of contracts in recent years most of our fixedprice work has been either negotiated fixedprice contracts or lump sum bid contracts for design andor project services rather than turnkey construction 

competition 

we compete with a large number of companies across the world including technology consulting federal it services aerospace defense and engineering firms typically no single company or companies dominate the markets in which we provide services and in many cases we partner with our competitors or other companies to jointly pursue projects aecom booz allen caci kbr leidos mantech parsons saic tetra tech wsp general dynamics northrop grumman accenture altair stantec montrose capgemini cognizant dxc technology fluor 3lharris epam systems globant endava exponent ibm infosys deloitte kpmg pwc perficient procure icf international ttec and huron are some of our competitors we compete based on the following factors among others technical capabilities reputation for quality price of services safety record availability of qualified personnel and ability to timely perform work and contract terms

page 24 

risks related to our operations 

we engage in a highly competitive business if we are unable to compete effectively we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

we face intense competition to provide technical professional and construction management services to clients the markets we serve are highly competitive and we compete against a large number of regional national and multinational companies the extent and type of our competition varies by industry geographic area and project type our projects are frequently awarded through a competitive procurement process we are constantly competing for project awards based on pricing schedule and the breadth and technical sophistication of our services competition can place downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins which increases the risk that among other things we may not realize profit margins at the same rates as we have seen in the past or may become responsible for costs or other liabilities we have not accepted in the past if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the award of these contracts 

our revenues depend on new contract awards delays in the timing of the awards or cancellations of such projects as a result of economic conditions material and equipment pricing and availability or other factors could impact our longterm projected results it is particularly difficult to predict whether or when we will receive largescale projects as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex procurement and selection process which is affected by a number of factors such as market conditions or governmental and environmental approvals since a significant portion of our revenues is generated from such projects our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards and the commencement or progress of work under awarded contracts furthermore many of these contracts are subject to financing contingencies and as a result we are subject to the risk that the customer will not be able to secure the necessary financing for the project 

the uncertainty of our contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs in some cases we maintain and bear the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than necessary under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards when an expected contract award is delayed or not received we incur additional costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

demand for our services are impacted by economic downturns reductions in government or private spending and times of political uncertainty 

we provide full spectrum technical and professional solutions to clients operating in a number of sectors and industries including programs for various national governments including the us federal government aerospace automotive pharmaceuticals and biotechnology infrastructure environmental nuclear decommissioning buildings smart cities energy and power water transportation telecom and other general industrial and consumer businesses and sectors these sectors and industries and the resulting demand for our services have been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control including economic conditions and changes in client spending particularly during periods of economic or political uncertainty 

uncertain global economic socioeconomic and political conditions may negatively impact our clients’ ability and willingness to fund their projects including their ability to raise capital and pay or timely pay our invoices these factors may also cause our clients to reduce their capital expenditures alter the mix of services purchased seek more favorable pricing and other contract terms and otherwise slow their spending on our services for example in the public sector declines in state and local tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending in addition under such conditions many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable these conditions may reduce the demand for our services which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally uncertain economic socioeconomic and political conditions may make it difficult for our clients our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities we cannot predict the outcome of changing trade policies or other unanticipated socioeconomic or political conditions nor can we predict the timing strength or duration of any economic recovery or downturn worldwide or in our clients’ markets in addition our business has 

page 25 

traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and therefore may not recover as quickly as the economy at large weak economic conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore if a significant portion of our clients or projects are concentrated in a specific geographic area or industry our business may be disproportionately affected by negative trends or economic downturns in those specific geographic areas or industries 

regardless of economic or socioeconomic or political conditions investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients’ markets and investment decisions as a result our past results have varied and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate 

rising inflation interest rates andor construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts in particular with respect to our fixedprice contracts 

rising inflation interest rates or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services in addition we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixedprice because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from costreimbursable type contracts approximately 74 during fiscal 2022 the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor however if we continue to experience inflationary pressures inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future particularly if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixedprice and lumpsum work is more prevalent therefore increases in inflation interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be unable to realize the benefits of implementing our threeyear corporate strategy 

this is a transformative time for the company in fiscal 2022 we launched our new threeyear corporate strategy after identifying three growth accelerators to achieve our vision for future growth climate response consultancy  advisory and data solutions a key component of our corporate strategy includes creating a new operating segment divergent solutions which is aligned to our data solutions growth accelerator developing a new business carries certain inherent risks including potential diversion of management’s time and other resources from our previouslyestablished revenue streams the need for additional capital and other resources to expand this new business and inefficient integration of operational and management systems and controls our success growing and developing the solutions offered by this new business will depend on a variety of factors some of which may be outside of our control there can be no assurance that creation of this operating segment will produce the revenues earnings or business synergies that we anticipate additionally we cannot assure you that our corporate strategy will be successful in achieving our financial growth targets or that we will deliver our anticipated results the failure to successfully implement our corporate strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business 

project sites are inherently dangerous workplaces failure to maintain safe work sites by us the owner or others working at the project site can lead to our employees or others becoming injured disabled or even losing their lives and exposes us to significant financial losses and reputational harm as well as civil and criminal liabilities 

project sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment moving vehicles chemical and manufacturing processes and hazardous and highly regulated materials in a challenging environment and often in geographically remote locations we may be responsible for safety on some project sites and accordingly we have an obligation to implement effective safety procedures the failure by us or others working at such sites to implement safety procedures or the implementation of ineffective procedures or the failure to implement and follow appropriate safety procedures subjects our employees and others to the risk of injury disability or loss of life and subjects us to risk that the completion or commencement of our projects may be delayed and we may be exposed to litigation or investigations unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover increase the cost of a project to our clients and raise our operating and insurance costs 

we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective hse work procedures throughout our organization including project sites and maintenance sites the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability in addition despite the work of our functional groups we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel or that there will be no damage to or loss of our work equipment or supplies 

page 26 

our safety record is critical to our reputation many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures 

for all of the foregoing reasons if we fail to maintain adequate safety standards we could suffer harm to our reputation reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the nature of our contracts particularly any fixedprice contracts subjects us to risks of cost overruns we may experience reduced profits or losses if costs increase above budgets or estimates or the project experiences delays 

for fiscal 2022 approximately 26 of our revenues were earned under fixedprice contracts both fixedprice and many costreimbursable contracts require us to estimate the total cost of the project in advance of our performance for fixedprice contracts we may benefit from any costsavings but we bear greater risk of paying some if not all of any cost overruns fixedprice contracts are established in part on proposed designs which may be partial or incomplete cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions including those about future economic conditions commodity and other materials pricing and cost and availability of labor including the cost of any related benefits or entitlements equipment and materials and other exigencies cost overruns can occur leading to reduced profits or in some cases a loss for that project for a variety of reasons including if the design or the estimates prove inaccurate or if circumstances change due to among other things unanticipated technical problems difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals changes in local laws or labor conditions weather or other delays beyond our control changes in the costs of equipment or raw materials our vendors’ or subcontractors’ inability or failure to perform or changes in general economic conditions and inflationary pressures we may present change orders and claims to our clients subcontractors and vendors for among other things additional costs exceeding the original contract price if we fail to properly document the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients subcontractors and vendors we will likely incur cost overruns reduced profits or in some cases result in a loss for a project these risks are exacerbated for projects with longterm durations because there is an increased risk that the circumstances on which we based our original estimates will change in a manner that increases costs the occurrence of significant costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our failure to meet performance requirements or contractual schedules could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

many of our contracts require us to satisfy specific progress or performance milestones in order to receive payment from the customer as a result we often incur significant costs for engineering materials components equipment labor or subcontractors prior to receipt of payment from a customer which may impact our liquidity in some circumstances we may incur penalties if we do not achieve project completion by a scheduled date in some cases the occurrence of delays may be due to factors outside of our control such as due to supply chain shortages 

our contracts that are fundamentally cost reimbursable in nature may also present a risk to the extent the final cost on a project exceeds the amount the customer expected or budgeted like fixedprice contracts the expected cost of costreimbursable projects is based in part on partial design and our estimates of the resources and time necessary to perform such contracts a portion of the fee is often linked to these estimates and the related final cost and schedule objectives and if for whatever reason these objectives are not met the project may be less profitable than we expect or even result in losses 

page 27 

the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted canceled or suspended by our clients and therefore our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings 

backlog represents estimates of the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us as of the end of fiscal 2022 our backlog totaled approximately 279 billion there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or if realized will result in profits in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts including our us government work are subject to cancellation termination or suspension at the discretion of the client and may be subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts in the event of a project cancellation we would generally have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project the risk of contracts in backlog being canceled or suspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns or in response to changes in commodity prices 

in some markets there is a continuing trend towards costreimbursable contracts with incentivefee arrangements typically our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs overall safety performance overall client satisfaction and other performance criteria if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards we may receive a lower or even zero incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins accordingly there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog assuming they produce the revenues currently expected will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks compared to contracts with private sector clients 

we depend on contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies the us federal government represented approximately 31 of our total revenue in fiscal 2022 these contracts which are a significant source of our revenue and profit are subject to additional risks compared to contracts with private sector clients 

• some of our contracts are longterm government contracts which are only funded on an annual basis in addition publicsupported financing such as state and local municipal bonds may be only partially raised to support existing infrastructure projects as a result at the beginning of a program the related contract is only partially funded and additional funding is normally committed only as appropriations are made in each fiscal year if appropriations for funding are not made in subsequent years of a multipleyear contract we may not be able to realize all of our anticipated revenue and profits from that project us government shutdowns or any related understaffing of the government departments or agencies that interact with our business could result in program cancellations disruptions andor stop work orders could limit the government’s ability to effectively progress programs and make timely payments and could limit our ability to perform on our existing us government contracts and successfully compete for new work governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for government programs may even be eliminated the us government may also shift its spending focus away from areas such as defense and space exploration and towards other areas in which we do not currently provide services 

• our contracts with governmental agencies are subject to audit investigations and proceedings which could result in adjustments to reimbursable contract costs or if we are charged with wrongdoing possible temporary or permanent suspension from participating in government programs and a variety of penalties can be imposed on us including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties 

• governmental agencies may modify curtail or terminate our contracts at any time prior to their completion and if we do not replace them we may suffer a decline in revenue in addition for some assignments the us government may attempt to “insource” the services to government employees rather than outsource to a contractor 

• most government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process which may emphasize price over other qualitative factors the us federal government has increasingly relied upon multipleyear contracts with multiple contractors that generally require those contractors to engage in an additional competitive procurement process for each task order issued under a contract this process may result in us facing significant additional pricing pressure and uncertainty and incurring additional costs 

• we may not be awarded government contracts because of existing policies designed to protect small businesses and underrepresented minorities

◦ government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socioeconomic requirements which affect how we transact business with our clients and in some instances impose additional costs on our business operations for example for contracts with the us federal government we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation the truth in negotiations act the cost accounting standards and numerous regulations governing environmental protection and employment practices government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than nongovernment contracts this includes for example unlimited indemnification obligations 

• many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances which can be difficult and time consuming to obtain if our employees or our facilities are unable to obtain or retain the necessary security clearances our clients could terminate or not renew existing contracts or award us new contracts which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

these various uncertainties restrictions and regulations including oversight audits by government authorities as well as profit and cost controls could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our services expose us to significant monetary damages or even criminal violations and our insurance policies may not provide adequate coverage 

we provide services that are subject to professional standards and qualifications including providing services that are based on our professional engineering expertise as well as our other professional credentials these services must comply with various professional standards duties and obligations regulating the performance of such services our engineering practice for example involves professional judgments regarding the planning design development construction operations and management of industrial facilities and public infrastructure projects we also issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional expertise such as issuing opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings while we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages in our contracts and although we have adopted a range of insurance risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities we may be deemed to be responsible for these professional judgments recommendations or opinions if they are later determined to be inaccurate or if a catastrophic event or other failure occurs at one of our project sites or completed projects any unfavorable legal ruling against us could result in substantial monetary damages disqualification to perform services in the future or even criminal violations 

such events could result in significant professional or product liability and warranty or other claims against us that could be highly publicized and have reputational harm especially if public safety is impacted we could also be liable to third parties including through class actions even if we are not contractually bound to those third parties these liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or the fees we generate may not be covered by insurance at all due to various exclusions in our coverage and could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future further even where coverage applies the policies have limits and deductibles or retentions which results in our assumption of exposure for certain amounts with respect to any claim filed against us in addition indemnification from clients or subcontractors may not be available an uninsured claim either in part or in whole as well as any claim covered by insurance but subject to a policy limit high deductible andor retention if successful and of a material magnitude could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation 

we are a party to claims and litigation in the normal course of business including litigation inherited through acquisitions since we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities and projects where design construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or others we are exposed to substantial claims and litigation and investigations due to the failure at any such facility or project such claims could relate to among other things personal injury loss of life business interruption property damage or pollution and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties such as those who use or reside near our clients’ projects we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met in many of our contracts with clients subcontractors and vendors we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages penalties losses and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those 

page 29 

contracts in addition while clients and subcontractors may agree to indemnify us against certain liabilities such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us 

with a workforce of approximately 60000 people globally we are also party to labor and employment claims in the normal course of business certain of these claims relate to allegations of harassment and discrimination pay equity denial of benefits wage and hour violations whistleblower protections concerted protected activity and other employment protections and may be pursued on an individual or class action basis depending on applicable laws and regulations some of such claims may be insurable while other such claims may not 

we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations our insurance programs have varying coverage limits as well as exclusions for matters such as fraud and insurance companies can and sometimes do attempt to deny claims for which we seek coverage in addition we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles retentions and limits under these programs as a result we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured 

in addition claims received from subcontractors or made by us for change orders can be the subject of lengthy negotiations arbitration or litigation proceedings which could result in the investment of significant amounts of working capital pending the resolution of the relevant change orders and claims a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results additionally irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant 

litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability product liability criminal liability warranty obligations default under our credit agreements and other liabilities which to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation 

unavailability or cancellation of thirdparty insurance coverage could increase our overall risk exposure as well as disrupt the management of our business operations 

we maintain insurance coverage from thirdparty insurers as part of our overall risk management strategy and because some of our contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage limits catastrophic events litigation claims and other market factors can result in decreased coverage limits coverage that is more limited increased premium costs or higher deductibles andor retentions if any of our thirdparty insurers fail suddenly cancel our coverage or otherwise are unable to provide us with adequate insurance coverage then our overall risk exposure and our operational expenses could increase and the management of our business operations could be disrupted in addition there can be no assurance that any of our existing insurance coverage will be renewable upon the expiration of the coverage period or that future coverage will be affordable at the required limits 

a reduction in the amount of available governmental funding could materially affect our results of operations 

historically we have benefited from both domestic and international government investment programs that provide funding for our services and we expect to continue to benefit from bills such as the infrastructure investment and jobs act the chips and science act and the inflation reduction act while spending and stimulus bills are expected to provide funding in many of the markets in which we operate we may not be able to obtain the expected benefits from these bills or similar bills in the future in addition the timing of funding awards under these bills is uncertain a reduction in the amount of governmental funding available could materially affect our results of operations 

we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts 

thirdparty subcontractors we hire perform a significant amount of the work performed under our contracts we also rely on thirdparty equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers our ability to successfully complete a project will be impaired if we are not able to locate qualified thirdparty subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated especially in a lump sum or a fixedprice contract we may suffer losses on these contracts if a subcontractor supplier or manufacturer fails to provide services supplies parts or equipment as required under a contract for any reason or fails to 

page 30 

provide such services supplies parts or equipment in accordance with applicable quality standards as required by the contract or regulation we will be required to source these services equipment parts or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms which could impact contract profitability andor could result in claims against us for damages we are subject to disputes with our subcontractors from time to time relating to among other things the quality and timeliness of work performed customer concerns about the subcontractor or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a contract in addition faulty workmanship equipment or materials would likely impact the overall project which could result in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications 

in an uncertain or downturn economic environment third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party’s ability to provide materials equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a failure by a third party subcontractor supplier or manufacturer to comply with applicable laws regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and for government clients could result in fines penalties suspension or even debarment being imposed on us which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

employee agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts which could result in reduced revenues and profits 

we are subject to the risk of misconduct fraud noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or other improper activities by one of our employees agents or partners which could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation such misconduct includes the failure to comply with government procurement regulations regulations regarding the protection of classified information regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts regulations on lobbying or similar activities regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting regulations pertaining to export control environmental laws employee wages pay and benefits and any other applicable laws or regulations for example we routinely provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters if a security breach were to occur our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective and we could face unknown risks or losses our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct subjects us to the risk of fines and penalties cancellation of contracts loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting any of which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

cybersecurity or privacy breaches or systems and information technology interruption or failure could adversely impact our ability to operate or expose us to significant financial losses and reputational harm 

we may experience interruptions errors and delays in our information technology systems in the event we are unable to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems the operation of such systems could be subjected to additional interruption or could result in the loss corruption or release of data in addition our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters force majeure events telecommunications failures power loss acts of war or terrorism computer viruses malicious code physical or electronic security breaches intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error or similar events or disruptions any of these or other events could cause interruptions delays loss of critical andor sensitive data or similar effects which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition protection of intellectual property and results of operations as well as those of our clients 

our information technology systems which have grown over time including through acquisitions have and will continue to experience threats including unauthorized access computer hackers computer viruses malicious code ransomware phishing organized cyberattacks and other security problems and system disruptions including unauthorized access to and disclosure of our and our clients’ proprietary or classified information such tactics have caused and may also seek to cause in the future payments due to or from the company to be misdirected to fraudulent accounts which may not be recoverable by the company 

page 31 

while we have security measures and technology in place designed to protect our and our clients’ proprietary or classified information there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent all threats to our computer systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently become more sophisticated and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures as a result we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of system disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these disruptions and breaches any of these events could damage our reputation cause us to incur significant liability and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we continuously evaluate the need to upgrade andor replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our computing environment to stay current on vendor supported products and to improve the efficiency of our systems and for other business reasons the implementation of new systems and information technology could adversely impact our operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems in addition our systems implementations may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated systems implementation disruption and any other information technology disruption if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in addition laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of personal data including the european union general data protection regulation gdpr the united kingdom data protection act the california consumer privacy act the california privacy rights act and other emerging us state and global privacy laws pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate costs and may require changes to our business practices resulting from the variation of regulatory requirements and increased enforcement frequency failure to comply with these laws and regulations including related regulatory enforcement andor private litigation resulting from a potential privacy breach could result in governmental investigations significant fines and penalties damages from private causes of action or reputational harm additionally we are subject to laws rules and regulations regarding crossborder transfers of personal data including laws relating to transfer of personal data outside the european economic area if we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data we may be unable to transfer personal data of employees and clients in those regions which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or that of our clients 

our technology and intellectual property provide us in certain instances with a competitive advantage although we seek to protect our property through registration licensing contractual arrangements security controls and similar mechanisms we may not be able to successfully preserve our rights and they could be invalidated circumvented challenged or become obsolete trade secrets are generally difficult to protect our employees and contractors are subject to confidentiality obligations but this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information andor infringement of our intellectual property in addition the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the us if we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights even if ultimately successful could be costly and could divert leadership’s attention away from other aspects of our business 

we also hold licenses from third parties which may be utilized in our business operations if we are no longer able to license such technology on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise our business and financial performance could be adversely affected 

if our intellectual property rights or work processes become obsolete we may not be able to differentiate our service offerings and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers our competitors may independently attempt to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies 

our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property there is a risk we may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and as a result could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities loss of contracts or other consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

page 32 

assertions by third parties of infringement misappropriation or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business financial condition and operation results 

in recent years there has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights in technology industries we may face from time to time allegations that we or a supplier or customer have violated the rights of third parties including patent trademark and other intellectual property rights if with respect to any claim against us for violation of thirdparty intellectual property rights we are unable to prevail in the litigation or retain or obtain sufficient rights or develop noninfringing intellectual property or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely or costefficient basis our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

any infringement misappropriation or related claims whether or not meritorious are time consuming divert technical and management personnel and are costly to resolve as a result of any such dispute we may have to develop noninfringing technology pay damages enter into royalty or licensing agreements cease utilizing products or services or take other actions to resolve the claims these actions if required may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us 

if we do not have adequate indemnification for our nuclear services it could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the priceanderson nuclear industries indemnity act commonly called the priceanderson act “paa” is a us federal law which among other things regulates radioactive materials and the nuclear energy industry including liability and compensation in the event of nuclear related incidents the paa provides certain protections and indemnification to nuclear energy plant operators and us department of energy “doe” contractors the paa protections and indemnification apply to us as part of our services to the us nuclear energy industry and doe for new facilities maintenance modification decontamination and decommissioning of nuclear energy weapons and research facilities 

we offer similar services in other jurisdictions outside the us for those jurisdictions varying levels of nuclear liability protection is provided by international treaties andor domestic laws such as the nuclear liability and compensation act of canada and the nuclear installations act of the united kingdom insurance andor assets of the nuclear installation operators some of which are backed by governments as well as under appropriate enforceable contractual indemnifications and holdharmless provisions these protections and indemnifications however may not cover all of our liability that could arise in the performance of these services to the extent the paa or other protections and indemnifications do not apply to our services the cost of losses associated with liability not covered by the available protections and indemnifications or by virtue of our loss of business because of these added costs could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements 

in preparing our financial statements our leadership is required under us gaap to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities areas requiring significant estimates by our leadership include 

• recognition of contract revenue costs profit or losses in applying the principles of percentage of completion accounting 

• estimated amounts for expected project losses warranty costs contract closeout or other costs 

• recognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims 

• collectability of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the need and amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts 

• estimates of other liabilities including litigation and insurance revenuesreserves and reserves necessary for selfinsured risks 

• accruals for estimated liabilities including litigation reserves 

• valuation of assets acquired and liabilities goodwill and intangible assets assumed in acquisitions and ongoing assessment of impairment 

• valuation estimates for redeemable noncontrolling interests calculations 

• valuation of stockbased compensation 

• the determination of liabilities under pension and other postretirement benefit programs and 

• income tax provisions and related valuation allowances 

page 33 

our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

impairment of longlived assets or restructuring activities may require us to record a significant charge to earnings 

our longlived assets including our lease rightofuse assets equity investments and others are subject to periodic testing for impairment failure to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow at the asset group level has resulted in and could result in additional impairment of our longlived assets further changes in the business environment could lead to changes in the scope of operations of our business these changes including the closure of one or more offices could result in restructuring andor asset impairment charges the covid19 pandemic raises the possibility of an extended global economic downturn which increase the risk of longlived asset impairment charges 

we may have to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and postretirement benefit plans we manage or for which we have contribution or funding obligations 

we have various employee benefit plan obligations that require us to make contributions to satisfy over time our underfunded benefit obligations which are generally determined by calculating the projected benefit obligations minus the fair value of plan assets for example as of september 30 2022 and october 1 2021 our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by 812 million and 1914 million respectively see note 13 pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k for additional disclosure in the future our benefit plan obligations may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of interest rates pension plan asset performance and other factors if we are required to contribute a significant amount of the deficit for underfunded benefit plans our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

we are also a participating employer in various multiemployer pension plans mepps associated with some of the work we perform on a union basis which mepps are managed by third party trusts and over which we have no control including as to how the mepps are managed or financial investment decisions are made if any of these mepps is underfunded we could face the imposition of underfunded liability or withdrawal liability at a materially adverse level 

our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control 

extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control such as natural or manmade disasters could negatively impact our ability to operate as an example from time to time we face unexpected severe weather conditions which may result in weatherrelated delays that are not always reimbursable under a fixedprice contract evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services increased labor and material costs in areas resulting from weatherrelated damage and subsequent increased demand for labor and materials for repairing and rebuilding inability to deliver materials equipment and personnel to job sites in accordance with contract schedules and loss of productivity we may remain obligated to perform our services after any such natural or manmade event unless a force majeure clause or other contractual provision provides us with relief from our contractual obligations if we are not able to react quickly to such events or if a high concentration of our projects are in a specific geographic region that suffers from a natural or manmade catastrophe our operations may be significantly affected which could have a material adverse impact on our operations in addition if we cannot complete our contracts on time we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients which may reduce our profits 

we must successfully manage the demand supply and operational challenges associated with the effects of disease outbreaks including epidemics pandemics or similar widespread public health concerns 

our business may be negatively impacted by disease outbreaks epidemics pandemics or similar widespread public health concerns such as the covid19 pandemic including as a result of fear of exposure to or actual effects of any diseases or the measures that international federal state and local public health and other governmental authorities implement to address it 

despite the availability of vaccines in some geographies covid19 continues to spread throughout the united states and globally including in regions where we have significant operations and personnel and uncertainties exist as to the efficacy of vaccines against new variants or mutations of covid19 although there has been an easing of restrictions such as “stay at home” orders and social distancing in certain jurisdictions some of these restrictions have been reinstated in other jurisdictions or could be reinstated in the future to manage a resurgence or new outbreak of covid19 or other 

page 34 

disease outbreaks including in connection with new variants or mutations of the virus in addition the reopening of businesses and economies in certain countries is creating a variety of new challenges including for example higher prices for goods and services limited availability of products and disruptions to supply chains as such the duration severity of its effects and ultimate impact to the world’s population and the global economy are still unknown 

the effects of disease outbreaks including epidemics pandemics or similar widespread public health concerns may adversely affect certain elements of our business including but not limited to the following 

• there may be reductions in demand for certain of our services and the delay or abandonment of ongoing or anticipated projects due to our clients’ suppliers’ and other thirdparties’ diminished financial conditions or financial distress as well as governmental budget constraints 

• our clients may be unable to meet their payment obligations to us in a timely manner including as a result of deteriorating financial condition or bankruptcy resulting from a disease outbreak including the ongoing covid19 pandemic and resulting economic impacts further other third parties such as suppliers subcontractors joint venture partners and other outside business partners may experience significant disruptions in their ability to satisfy their obligations with respect to us or they may be unable to do so altogether 

• illness travel restrictions or other workforce disruptions could adversely affect our supply chain our ability to timely and satisfactorily complete our clients’ projects our ability to provide services to our clients or our other business processes similar to travel restrictions implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic jurisdictions may close borders impose prolonged quarantines and restrict travel and business activity in the event of a future disease outbreak or resurgence which could materially impair our ability to support our operations and clients both domestic and international to source supplies through the global supply chain and to identify pursue and capture new business opportunities and which could continue to restrict the ability of our employees to access their workplaces we also face the possibility of increased overhead or other expenses resulting from compliance with any current and future government orders or other measures enacted in response to any future disease outbreak or resurgence 

• we operate in many countries around the world and certain of those countries’ governments may be unable to effectively mitigate the financial or other impacts of any future disease outbreak on their economies and workforces and our operations therein 

the extent to which a disease outbreak or resurgence impacts our business financial condition and results of operations including the duration and magnitude of such impacts will depend on numerous factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess disease outbreaks and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming therefrom as well as reactions to future pandemics or resurgences of covid19 could also precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors that we identify in this annual report on form 10k which in turn could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations there may be other adverse consequences to our business financial condition and results of operations from the spread of covid19 or other diseases that we have not considered or have not become apparent as a result we cannot assure you that if covid19 continues to spread or there are other significant disease outbreaks it would not have a further adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel 

the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel including engineers architects designers craft personnel and corporate leadership professionals who have the required experience and expertise at a reasonable cost the market for these and other personnel is competitive from time to time it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients or to replace such personnel when needed in a timely manner in certain geographic areas for example we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel furthermore some of our personnel hold government granted clearance that may be required to obtain government projects if we were to lose some or all of these personnel they would be difficult to replace loss of the services of or failure to recruit qualified technical and leadership personnel could limit our ability to successfully complete existing projects and compete for new projects 

in addition in the event that any of our key personnel retire or otherwise leave the company we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans which requires devoting time and resources toward identifying and integrating new personnel into leadership roles and other key positions if we cannot 

page 35 

attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

sustained remote working arrangements may increase our costs and adversely impact our culture and ability to effectively train our personnel 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic unprecedented numbers of employees worldwide shifted to working remotely across industries including in our industry despite the easing of government mandated remote work many employees continue to work remotely on either a fulltime or hybrid basis while we have begun voluntary phased reopenings in our offices in accordance with guidance provided by government agencies the majority of our employees are currently still working remotely and we expect sustained remote working arrangements to continue for a significant percentage of our employees 

although many of our employees can effectively perform their responsibilities while working remotely and the opportunity to work remotely may increase the geographic markets from where we may attract talent some work is not wellsuited for remote work and that work may not be completed as efficiently as if it were performed on site additionally we may be exposed to unexpected cybersecurity risks and additional information technologyrelated expenses as a result of remote working requirements 

as employees continue to work remotely we must adopt new techniques and tools to effectively train and integrate new hires and preserve our culture failure to effectively train our employees could create challenges for us in maintaining high levels of employee awareness of and compliance with our internal procedures and external regulatory compliance requirements in addition to increasing our recruiting training and supervisory costs while failure to preserve our culture for any reason could harm our future success including our ability to retain and recruit personnel innovate and operate effectively and execute on our business strategy 

negotiations with labor unions and possible work actions could disrupt operations and increase labor costs and operating expenses 

a certain portion of our work force has entered into and additional portions may in the future enter into collective bargaining agreements which on occasion may require renegotiation the outcome of future negotiations relating to union representation or collective bargaining agreements may not be favorable to the company in that they may increase our operating expenses and lower our net income as a result of higher wages or benefit expenses in addition negotiations with unions diverts management attention and could disrupt operations which may adversely affect our results of operations if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements we may have to address the threat of unioninitiated work actions including work slowdowns and strikes depending on the nature of the threat or the type and duration of any work action these actions could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our professional reputation and relationships with government agencies are critical to our business and any harm to our reputation or relationships could decrease the amount of business that governments do with us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a significant portion of our revenue is earned directly or indirectly from various government agencies if our reputation or relationships with these agencies were harmed our future revenue and growth prospects would be materially and adversely affected our reputation and relationship with these government agencies is a key factor in maintaining and growing revenue under our government contracts negative press reports regarding poor contract performance employee misconduct information security breaches engagements in or perceived connections to politically or socially sensitive activities or other aspects of our business or regarding government contractors generally could harm our reputation in addition to the extent our performance under a contract does not meet a government agency’s expectations the client might seek to terminate the contract prior to its scheduled expiration date provide a negative assessment of our performance to governmentmaintained contractor pastperformance data repositories fail to award us additional business under existing contracts or otherwise and direct future business to our competitors if our reputation or relationships with these agencies are negatively affected or if we are suspended or debarred from contracting with government agencies for any reason such actions would decrease the amount of business that the government agency does with us which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

page 36 

our focus on new growth areas for our business entails risks including those associated with new relationships clients talent needs capabilities service and product offerings and maintaining our collaborative culture and core values 

we are focused on growing our presence in our addressable markets by expanding our relationships with existing clients developing new clients by leveraging our core competencies further developing our existing capabilities and service offerings creating new capabilities and solutions offerings to address our clients emerging needs and undertaking business development efforts focused on identifying nearterm developments and longterm trends that may pose significant challenges for our clients these efforts entail inherent risks associated with innovation and competition from other participants in those areas potential failure to help our clients respond to the challenges they face our ability to comply with uncertain evolving legal standards applicable to certain of our offerings including those in the cybersecurity area and with respect to potential international growth risks associated with operating in foreign jurisdictions such as compliance with applicable foreign and us laws and regulations that may impose different and occasionally conflicting or contradictory requirements and the economic legal and political conditions in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate as we attempt to develop new relationships clients capabilities and service and product offerings these efforts could harm our results of operations due to among other things a diversion of our focus and resources and actual costs opportunity costs of pursuing these opportunities in lieu of others and a failure to reach a profitable return on our investments in new technologies capabilities and businesses including expenses on research and development investments and these efforts could ultimately be unsuccessful 

the needs of our customers change and evolve regularly our success depends upon our ability to identify emerging technological trends develop technologically advanced innovative and costeffective products and services and market these products and services to our customers for example one of our business strategies is to invest in develop and promote innovative climate response technologies and solutions in order to meet the demands of our public and private sector clients a misalignment between the technologies and solutions we identify to invest in develop and promote and our clients’ needs may adversely impact our results of operations and reputation although we have strategies to mitigate this risk we cannot assure you that we will identify the most effective technologies and solutions to invest in promote or develop additionally as we diversify and expand our product offerings there is also an increased risk that one or more of our product offerings could fail to meet specifications in a particular application or could be perceived by our customers to contain defects which could result in our being liable for damages and losses that arise from such products products with defects or which are otherwise incompatible with intended end uses may also result in us having to recall such products or provide additional services under the product warranty which may impact our profitability a failure of our products and solutions to meet specifications may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our success also depends on our continued access to suppliers of important technologies and components the possibility exists that our competitors might develop new capabilities or service offerings that might cause our existing capabilities and service offerings to become obsolete if we fail in our new capabilities development efforts or our capabilities or services fail to achieve market acceptance more rapidly than our competitors our ability to procure new contracts could be negatively impacted which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition with the growth of our us and international operations we provide client services and undertake business development efforts in numerous and disparate geographic locations both domestically and internationally our ability to effectively serve our clients is dependent upon our ability to successfully leverage our operating model across all of these and any future locations maintain effective management controls over all of our locations to ensure among other things compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations and instill our core values in all of our personnel at each of these and any future locations any inability to ensure any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers’ investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation delays in existing work or changes in the timing and funding of new awards 

commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways for example for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil gas copper or fertilizers fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and therefore their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments furthermore declines in commodity prices can negatively impact our business in regions whose economies are substantially dependent on commodity prices such as the middle east to the extent commodity prices decline or fluctuate and our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects the demand for our services decreases which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

page 37 

commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned as well as those in progress and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to international operations 

our international operations are exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies 

for fiscal 2022 approximately 34 of our revenue was earned from clients outside the us our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues our international operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

• recessions and other economic crises in other regions such as europe asia or other specific foreign economies and the impact on our costs of doing business in those countries 

• difficulties in staffing and managing foreign personnel and operations including challenges related to logistics communications and professional licensure of our international workforce 

• unexpected changes in foreign government policies and regulatory requirements 

• potential noncompliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations including anticorruption export control and antiboycott laws and similar nonus laws and regulations 

• potential noncompliance with regulations and evolving industry standards regarding consumer protection and data use and security including the general data protection regulation approved by the european union and the data protection act approved by the united kingdom 

• lack of developed legal systems to enforce contractual rights 

• expropriation and nationalization of our assets in a foreign country 

• renegotiation or nullification of our existing contracts 

• the adoption of new and the expansion of existing trade or other restrictions 

• embargoes duties tariffs or other trade restrictions including sanctions 

• geopolitical developments that impact our or our clients’ ability to operate in a foreign country 

• changes in labor conditions 

• acts of war aggression between nations civil unrest force majeure and terrorism 

• the ability to finance efficiently our foreign operations 

• social political and economic instability 

• changes to tax policy 

• currency exchange rate fluctuations 

• limitations on the ability to repatriate foreign earnings and 

• us government policy changes in relation to the foreign countries in which we operate 

the lack of a welldeveloped legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights in addition military action geopolitical shifts or continued unrest particularly in the middle east could disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere and may impact the supply or pricing of oil increase our security costs and cost of compliance with local laws and present risks to our reputation additionally recent events including changes in us trade policies and responsive changes in policy by foreign jurisdictions and similar geopolitical developments and uncertainty in the eu asia and elsewhere have increased levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and may increase the volatility of global financial markets and the global and regional economies 

page 38 

in addition our globally connected talent force collaborates to deliver solutions for clients agnostic of geography this relies upon client procurement models that are open to global professional service provision increased nationalization and heightened “buylocal” policies and regulation could reduce the effectiveness and competitive differentiation enabled by our global delivery model and compound the existing talent shortage in key geographies to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic political and other conditions our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects 

we are a global professional services company with our international operations accounting for approximately 34 of our annual revenue in fiscal year 2022 fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies have reduced and could continue to reduce the us dollar value of sales earnings and cash flows we receive from nonus markets negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results reported financial condition and the us dollar value of our backlog our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects both positive and negative that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar into the us dollar 

in addition fluctuations in exchange rates may increase our supply costs as measured in us dollars in international markets while we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in the currencies of our expenditures we do enter into contracts that expose us to currency risk particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs we may attempt to minimize our exposure from currency risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies or entering into derivative hedging instruments when there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts these actions however may not always eliminate currency risk exposure the governments of certain countries have or may in the future impose restrictive exchange controls on local currencies and it may not be possible for us to engage in effective hedging transactions to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in a particular currency we may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries 

our global presence could give rise to material fluctuations in our income tax rates 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation the introduction of new tax accounting standards legislation regulations and related interpretations our global mix of earnings the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate or an ultimate determination that the company owes more taxes than the amounts previously accrued could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we work in international locations where there are high security risks which could result in harm to our employees or unanticipated costs 

some of our services are performed in highrisk locations where the country or location is subject to political social or economic risks or war terrorism or civil unrest in those locations where we have employees or operations we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel despite these activities in these locations we cannot always guarantee the safety of our personnel  acts of terrorism and threats of armed conflicts in or around various areas in which we operate could limit or disrupt markets and our operations including disruptions resulting from the evacuation of personnel or the cancellation of contracts the loss of key employees or contractors whether as a result of injury death or attrition may adversely impact our business operations  

page 39 

our operations may be impacted by the united kingdom’s exit from the european union 

on december 24 2020 the eu and the uk agreed the terms of a trade and cooperation agreement which sets out the terms of their future relationship which we refer to as the trade agreement in connection with the uks exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” the trade agreement was approved by the uk parliament and applied provisionally until the end of april 2021 when the european parliament approved the trade agreement the trade agreement offers uk and eu businesses preferential access to each other’s markets ensuring imported goods will be free of tariffs and quotas however economic relations between the uk and the eu will now be on more restricted terms than before and there remains uncertainty around the postbrexit regulatory environment as the provisions of the trade agreement do not cover the services sector 

these restrictions may adversely affect our relationships with our existing and future customers suppliers employees and subcontractors or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the diverging regulatory environments also add additional complexity to our compliance programs this uncertainty could cause significant economic disruption and further depress consumer confidence and the economy of the uk which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs terminate or reduce the scope of existing contracts decrease or postpone currently planned contracts or negotiate for more favorable deal terms each of which may have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to acquisitions investments joint ventures and divestitures 

if we or any of our subsidiaries or companies in which we have made strategic investments lose or experience a significant reduction in business from one or a few customers it could have a material adverse impact on us 

a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue andor backlog or the revenue andor backlog for our subsidiaries or companies in which we have made strategic investments  in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years for example in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 approximately 31 33 and 33 respectively of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government although we have longstanding relationships with many of our significant clients our clients may unilaterally reduce delay or cancel their contracts at any time if we or any of our subsidiaries or companies in which we have made strategic investments lose or experience a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our use of joint ventures partnerships and strategic investments in entities exposes us to risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control 

as is common in our industry we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures partnerships and similar arrangements this situation exposes us to a number of risks including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients 

further we have limited ability to control the actions of our joint venture partners including with respect to nonperformance default bankruptcy or legal or regulatory compliance our partners may be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships if these circumstances occur we may be liable for claims and losses attributable to the partner by operation of law or contract these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend on the management effectiveness of our joint venture partners differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major issues which could materially affect the business and operations of these ventures in addition in many of the countries in which we engage in joint ventures it may be difficult to enforce our contractual rights under the applicable joint venture agreement if we are not able to enforce our contractual rights we may not be able to realize the benefits of the joint venture or we may be subject to additional liabilities 

we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner in these cases we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

page 40 

the failure by a joint venture partner to comply with applicable laws regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and for government clients could result in fines penalties suspension or even debarment being imposed on us which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

an impairment charge on our goodwill or intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

because we have grown in part through acquisitions goodwill and intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets as of september 30 2022 we had 718 billion of goodwill representing 490 of our total assets of 1466 billion under us gaap we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis and whenever events occur or circumstances change that indicate impairments could exist based upon a fair value approach we also assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our intangible assets when indications of impairment are present based on expected future probability and undiscounted expected cash flows and their contribution to our overall operations we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter 

if our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value we could be required to record an impairment charge the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing please see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 

our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions and strategic investments to sustain our growth these transactions present certain risks and uncertainties 

our business strategy involves growth through among other things the acquisition of and strategic investments in other companies such as our acquisitions of ch2m keyw john wood group’s nuclear business buffalo group blacklynx and streetlight and we completed a strategic investment in pa consulting in march 2021 these transactions as well as transactions we may engage in in the future present a number of risks including 

• assumption of liabilities of an acquired business including liabilities that were unknown at the time the transaction was negotiated such as if the target company failed to comply with us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations andor contractual requirements with government clients 

• valuation methodologies may not accurately capture the value of the target companys business 

• failure to realize anticipated benefits such as cost savings synergies business opportunities and growth opportunities within the anticipated timeframe or at all 

• the loss of key customers or suppliers including as a result of any actual or perceived conflicts of interest 

• difficulties or delays in obtaining regulatory approvals licenses and permits 

• difficulties relating to combining previously separate entities into a single integrated and efficient business 

• for strategic investments in which we do not acquire 100 of the target company the other equity holders may have consent rights over certain actions taken by the company and in the event a target company continues to operate as a standalone company it may result in additional costs 

• the effects of diverting leadership’s attention from daytoday operations to matters involving the integration of target companies 

• potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations strategic investments andor divestitures 

• potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition or investment or postclosing deterioration in the target companys business 

• difficulties relating to assimilating the leadership personnel benefits services and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities 

• difficulties retaining key personnel of the target company 

• increased burdens on our staff and on our administrative internal control and operating systems which may hinder our legal and regulatory compliance activities 

page 41 

• increased financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning treasury management financial and nonfinancial eg climaterelated reporting and internal controls 

• the potential for claims for damages by the sellers of any business if we enter into an acquisition agreement that we do not ultimately consummate or if disputes arise postclosing relating to postclosing covenants or payment obligations and 

• the risks discussed in this item 1a risk factors that may relate to the activities of the acquired business prior to the acquisition 

while we may obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses andor insurance that could mitigate certain of these risks such rights may be difficult to enforce the losses may exceed any dedicated escrow funds and the indemnitors may not have the ability to financially support the indemnity or the insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover all losses 

if our leadership is unable to successfully integrate acquired companies or implement our growth strategy with respect to acquisitions andor strategic investments our operating results could be harmed moreover we cannot assure that we will continue to successfully expand or that growth or expansion will result in profitability 

in addition there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition or investment targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us existing cash balances and cash flow from operations together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities may be insufficient to make acquisitions andor strategic investments future acquisitions andor strategic investments may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing which may not be available on attractive terms or at all acquisitions andor strategic investments may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 

acquisitions strategic investments and divestitures create various business risks and uncertainties during the pendency of the transaction 

consummation of any merger strategic investment or divestiture is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions including one or more of the following i due diligence and its associated time and cost commitments ii board and shareholder approval iii regulatory approvals iv the absence of any legal restraint that would prevent the consummation of the transaction v the absence of material adverse conditions which can prevent the consummation of the transaction and vi compliance with covenants and the accuracy of representations and warranties contained in the transaction agreement among others one or more of these conditions may not be fulfilled and accordingly the transaction may not be consummated or may be significantly delayed in such case our ongoing business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the market price of our common stock may decline particularly to the extent that the market price reflects a market assumption that the transaction will be consummated or will be consummated within a particular timeframe 

furthermore most transactions require the company to incur substantial expense associated with closing and if the transaction is not consummated we will incur these expenses without realizing the expected benefits the pursuit of the transaction will also require management attention and use of internal resources that would otherwise be focused on general business operations in addition customers’ uncertainty about the effect of the transaction may have an adverse effect on the ability to win customer contracts or could cause existing clients to seek to change existing business relationships employee morale due to the uncertainties associated with the transaction could also be negatively affected any of the foregoing or other risks arising in connection with a failure or delay in consummating a transaction including the diversion of management attention or loss of other opportunities during the pendency of the transaction could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may make minority investments that subject us to risks and uncertainties outside of our control 

from time to time the company may make minority investments in the equity securities of companies that we do not control minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational andor compliance risks associated with the minority investment 

page 42 

to the extent we hold only a minority equity interest in a company we may lack affirmative control rights which may diminish our ability to influence the company’s affairs in a manner intended to enhance the value of our investment in the company we could incur losses if the majority stakeholders or the management of the company takes risks or otherwise acts in a manner that does not serve our interests in addition we could be subject to reputational harm if the company in which the investment is made makes business financial or management decisions with which we do not agree these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with management or employees of the company in which the investment is made or its other stockholders 

in most cases the companies in which we make investments will have indebtedness or equity securities or may be permitted to incur indebtedness or to issue equity securities that rank senior to our investment we also may make investments in earlystage companies that depend on venture funding and are not profitable in the event of insolvency liquidation dissolution reorganization or bankruptcy of a company in which an investment is made holders of debt instruments and securities ranking senior to our investment would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before distributions could be made in respect of our investment 

we may also enter into separate commercial arrangements with these companies whether before concurrently with or after making a minority investment in certain cases the commercial arrangement may be a driving factor behind our investment we cannot assure you that that the commercial arrangement will further our business strategy as we expected we may not realize all the economic benefits expected from the commercial agreement or realize the expected return on our investments 

risks related to regulatory compliance 

past and future environmental health and safety laws could impose significant additional costs and liabilities 

we are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities 

various us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants the liability under these laws may be joint and several we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen cleanup obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

health safety and environmental laws and regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes thereto could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could for example relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and in turn could negatively impact our revenue changes in the environmental laws and regulations remediation obligations enforcement actions stricter interpretations of existing requirements future discovery of contamination or claims for damages to persons property natural resources or the environment could result in material costs and liabilities that we currently do not anticipate failure to comply with any environmental health or safety laws or regulations whether actual or alleged exposes us to fines penalties or potential litigation liabilities including costs settlements and judgments any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

page 43 

if we fail to comply with any governmental requirements our business may be adversely affected 

we are subject to us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business for example our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders which requires compliance with both export regulatory laws and international trafficking in arms regulations “itar” although we have policies and procedures to comply with us and foreign international trade laws the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges or debarment from participation in us government contracts and could damage our reputation and our ability to do business 

in addition we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments which requires us or our clients to obtain and to comply with federal state and local government permits and approvals these permits or approvals are subject to denial revocation or modification under various circumstances failure to obtain or comply with or the loss or modification of the conditions of permits or approvals subjects us to the risk of penalties or other liabilities could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and result of operations 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act of 2010 and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices despite our training and compliance programs there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions including contract cancellations or debarment and loss of reputation any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to climate change 

climate change and related environmental issues could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

climate change related events such as increased frequency and severity of storms floods wildfires droughts hurricanes freezing conditions and other natural disasters may have a longterm impact on our business financial condition and results of operation while we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change we recognize that there are inherent climate related risks regardless of where we conduct our business for example a catastrophic natural disaster could negatively impact any of our office locations and the locations of our customers access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business is critical to our operations accordingly a natural disaster has the potential to disrupt our and our customers’ businesses and may cause us to experience work stoppages project delays financial losses and additional costs to resume operations including increased insurance costs or loss of coverage legal liability and reputational losses 

further the risks caused by climate change span across the full spectrum of the industry sectors we serve our services and solutions span water energy the natural and built environment transportation national security cyber and aerospace the direct physical risks that climate change poses to infrastructure through chronic environmental changes such as rising sea levels and temperatures and acute events such as hurricanes droughts and wildfires is common to each of these sectors infrastructure owners could face increased costs to maintain their assets which could result in reduced profitability and fewer resources for strategic investment these types of physical risks could in turn lead to transitional risks ie the degree to which society responds to the threat of climate change such as market and technology shifts including decreased demand for our services and solutions reputational risks such as how our values and practices regarding a low carbon transition are viewed by external and internal stakeholders and policy and legal risks such as the extent to which low carbon transitions are driven by the governments in which we operate around the globe all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

page 44 

we may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change 

growing public concern about climate change has resulted in the increased focus of local state regional national and international regulatory bodies on ghg emissions and climate change issues the biden administration has made climate change and the limitation of ghg emissions one of its initial and primary objectives policy changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or in some cases prevent a project from going forward thereby potentially reducing the need for our services which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations further climate legislation across all geographies poses a similar risk to us and our clients as we operate globally however policy changes and climate legislation could also increase the overall demand for our services as our clients and partners work to comply with such policies such as by decarbonizing their industries transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources and developing integrated and sustainable solutions which could have a positive impact on our business we cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers 

we may also incur additional expenses as a result of us and international regulators requiring additional disclosures regarding ghg emissions compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change 

we may be unable to achieve our climate commitments and targets 

at jacobs we have committed to help solve the climate crisis by setting ambitious climate commitments and targets including our goal to be carbon negative for our operations and business travel however achievement of our climate commitments and targets including our carbon negative goal is subject to risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to our ability to execute our operational strategies and achieve our goals within the currently projected costs and the expected timeframes the availability and cost of alternative fuels global electrical charging infrastructure offsite renewable energy and other materials and components unforeseen design operational and technological difficulties the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments including the ability to scale projects and technologies on a commercially competitive basis such as carbon sequestration andor other related processes compliance with and changes or additions to global and regional regulations taxes charges mandates or requirements relating to ghg emissions carbon costs or climaterelated goals laborrelated regulations and requirements that restrict or prohibit our ability to impose requirements on third party contractors adapting products to customer preferences and customer acceptance of sustainable supply chain solutions the actions of competitors and competitive pressures an acquisition of or merger with another company that has not adopted similar carbon negative goals or whose progress towards reaching its carbon negative goals is not as advanced as ours and the pace of regional and global recovery from the covid19 pandemic accordingly there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our operational strategies and achieve our climate commitments and targets 

while our climate commitments and targets are ambitious we believe that they are realistic and achievable we have also developed a roadmap for implementation of our carbon reduction goals and our global emissions reduction trajectory suggests that we are on the pathway to meet our targets however we also recognize that some of our emission reductions over the past two years may have been primarily the result of the global covid19 pandemic our roadmap recognizes this and we are putting measures in place now to ensure that we remain on that same trajectory however we cannot guarantee that such measures will be successful failure to achieve our climate commitments and targets could damage our reputation and our customer and other stakeholder relationships further investors have recently increased their focus on environmental social and governance matters including practices related to ghgs and climate change an increasing percentage of the investment community considers sustainability factors in making investment decisions and an increasing number of entities are considering sustainability factors in awarding business if we are unable to meet our climate commitments and targets and appropriately address sustainability enhancement we may lose investors customers or partners our stock price may be negatively impacted our reputation may be negatively affected and it may be more difficult for us to compete effectively all of which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

page 45 

risks related to our indebtedness and credit markets 

we rely in part on liquidity from our credit facilities to fund our business restrictions in our credit facilities could adversely affect our business 

we are currently a borrower under several credit facilities these facilities all contain customary covenants restricting among other things our ability to incur certain liens and indebtedness we are also subject to certain financial covenants including maintenance of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio a breach of any covenant or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under one or more of our credit facilities and limit our ability to do further borrowing we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and if we fail to do so we may be prohibited from undertaking actions that are necessary or desirable to maintain or expand our business additionally if it becomes necessary to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or if we are unable to refinance at all our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by increased costs and rates 

our business may be adversely affected by disruptions or lack of liquidity in the credit markets including reduced access to credit and higher costs of obtaining credit 

we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions instability in the credit markets in the us or abroad and continued inflation and rising interest rates could cause the availability of credit to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain at competitive rates on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts this situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds refinance our existing indebtedness enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 

in addition market conditions could negatively impact our clients’ ability to fund their projects and therefore utilize our services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors suppliers and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets disruptions of the credit or capital markets could adversely affect our clients’ ability to finance projects and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions project delays and payment delays or defaults by our clients in addition clients may be unable to fund new projects may choose to make fewer capital expenditures or otherwise slow their spending on our services or to seek contract terms more favorable to them these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

furthermore our cash balances and shortterm investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america europe south america australia and asia some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance in addition we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us although none of our lenders or the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership or have been seized by their governments there is a risk that such events may occur in the future if any such events were to occur we would be at risk of not being able to access cash which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

page 46 

maintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts 

in line with industry practice we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds or letters of credit to our customers these instruments indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract if a bond or a letter of credit is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond or letter of credit we cannot pursue that project historically we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity but as is typically the case the issuance of a bond is at the surety’s sole discretion and the issuance of a letter of credit is based on the companys creditworthiness because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms in addition future projects may require us to obtain letters of credit that extend beyond the term of our existing credit facilities our inability to obtain adequate bonding and as a result to bid on new contracts that require such bonding or letter of credit could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to our common stock and corporate structure 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly or fall below the expectations of securities analysts which could have a material adverse impact on the price of our common stock fluctuations are caused by a number of factors including 

• legal proceedings disputes andor government investigations 

• fluctuations in the spending patterns of our government and commercial customers 

• the number and significance of projects executed during a quarter 

• unanticipated changes in contract performance particularly with contracts that have funding limits 

• the timing of resolving change orders requests for equitable adjustments and other contract adjustments 

• delays incurred in connection with a project 

• changes in prices of commodities or other supplies 

• changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

• weather conditions that delay work at project sites 

• the timing of expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions or other corporate initiatives 

• the decision by the board of directors to begin or cease paying a dividend and the expectation that if the company pays dividends it would declare dividends at the same or higher levels in the future 

• natural disasters or other crises 

• staff levels and utilization rates 

• changes in prices of services offered by our competitors and 

• general economic and political conditions 

there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends on our common stock 

our board of directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program in fiscal 2017 under which we have paid and intend to continue paying regular quarterly dividends the declaration amount and timing of such dividends are subject to capital availability and determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and applicable agreements our ability to pay dividends will depend upon among other factors our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions including acquisitions debt service requirements results of operations financial condition and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant a reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments andor our dividend program could have a material negative effect on our stock price 

page 47 

in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make we could dilute share ownership and if we receive stock in connection with a divestiture the value of stock is subject to fluctuation 

one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities if we issue additional equity securities such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders’ individual ownership percentages in the company 

in addition if we receive stock or other equity securities in connection with a sale or divestiture of a business the value of such stock will fluctuate andor be subject to trading restrictions stock price changes may result from among other things changes in the business operations or prospects of the issuer prior to or following the transaction litigation or regulatory considerations general business market industry or economic conditions the ability to sell all or a portion of the stock based on current market conditions and other factors both within and beyond the control of the company in addition if the stock received is valued in a currency other than us dollars the value of such stock will also fluctuate based on foreign currency rates 

delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control 

we are a delaware corporation certain antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us in addition certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover for example 

• only our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board 

• there are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election and 

• our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preferred shares 

these types of provisions as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders accordingly shareholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares 

we are a holding company substantially all of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries we depend on the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to make distributions to us to fund our operations 

we are a holding company substantially all of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries which are separate and distinct legal entities therefore we are reliant on the operations of our subsidiaries to fund whether by dividend distribution or loan holding company operations including our ability to pay dividends and service any indebtedness of the holding company in addition we cannot assure you that the agreements governing the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends distributions or loans to fund payments of dividends or other obligations of the holding company in addition any payment of dividends distributions or loans to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law and monetary transfer restrictions in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate furthermore payments to us by our subsidiaries will be contingent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in order to better understand the changes that occur to key elements of our financial condition results of operations and cash flows a reader of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business performing longterm professional services engineering and constructiontype contracts requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect both the entity’s results of operations and the carrying values of its assets and liabilities although our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k the following discussion is intended to highlight and describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue accounting for contracts 

the company recognizes engineering procurement and construction contract revenue over time as performance obligations are satisfied due to the continuous transfer of control to the customer in accordance with asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers  contracts that include engineering procurement and construction services are generally accounted for as a single deliverable a single performance obligation in some instances the company’s services associated with a construction activity are limited only to specific tasks such as customer support consulting or supervisory services in these instances the services are typically identified as separate performance obligations 

the company recognizes revenue using the percentageofcompletion method based primarily on contract costs incurred to date compared to total estimated contract costs estimated contract costs include the company’s latest estimates using judgments with respect to labor hours and costs materials and subcontractor costs the percentageofcompletion method an input method is the most representative depiction of the company’s performance because it directly measures the value of the services transferred to the customer subcontractor materials labor and equipment and in certain cases customerfurnished materials and labor and equipment are included in revenue and cost of revenue when management believes that the company is acting as a principal rather than as an agent eg the company integrates the materials labor and equipment into the deliverables promised to the customer or is otherwise primarily responsible for fulfillment and acceptability of the materials labor andor equipment under the typical payment terms of our engineering procurement and construction contracts amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreedupon contractual terms at periodic intervals eg biweekly or monthly and customer payments are typically due within 30 to 60 days of billing depending on the contract 

for service contracts the company recognizes revenue over time using the costtocost percentageofcompletion method in some instances where the company is standing ready to provide services the company recognizes revenue ratably over the service period under the typical payment terms of our service contracts amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreedupon contractual terms and customer payments are typically due within 30 to 60 days of billing depending on the contract 

direct costs of contracts include all costs incurred in connection with and directly for the benefit of client contracts including depreciation and amortization relating to assets used in providing the services required by the related projects the level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors including the amount of pass through costs we incur during a period on those projects where we are acting as principal for subcontract labor or thirdparty materials and equipment we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs and we refer to such costs as “pass through costs” 

page 52 

accounting for pension plans 

the accounting for pension plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans’ assets and liabilities these assumptions include discount rates investment returns and projected salary increases among others the actuarial assumptions used in determining the funded statuses of the plans are provided in note 13 pension and other postretirement benefit plans of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

the expected rates of return on plan assets ranged from 2 to 7 for fiscal 2022 and range from 33 to 75 fiscal 2023 we believe the range of rates selected for fiscal 2023 reflects the longterm returns expected on the plans’ assets considering recent market conditions projected rates of inflation the diversification of the plans’ assets and the expected real rates of market returns the discount rates used to compute plan liabilities ranged from 24 to 74 in fiscal 2022 and range from 24 to 74 in fiscal 2023 these assumptions represent the company’s best estimate of the rates at which its pension obligations could be effectively settled 

changes in the actuarial assumptions often have a material effect on the values assigned to plan assets and liabilities and the associated pension expense for example if the discount rate used to value the net pension benefit obligation “pbo” at september 30 2022 was lower or higher by 10 the pbo would have been higher or lower respectively at that date by approximately 1568 million for nonus plans and by approximately 237 million for us plans if the expected return on plan assets was lower or higher by 10 the net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2022 would be higher or lower respectively by approximately 212 million for nonus plans and by approximately 34 million for us plans differences between actuarial assumptions and actual performance ie actuarial gains and losses that are not recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost in the period in which such differences arise are recorded to accumulated other comprehensi ve income loss and are recognized as part of net periodic pension cost in future periods in accordance with us gaap management monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in an effort to assure the reasonableness of the actuarial assumptions used 

redeemable noncontrolling interests 

in connection with the pa consulting investment the company recorded redeemable noncontrolling interests representing the interest holders 35 equity interest in the form of preferred and common shares of pa consulting the preferred shares are entitled to a cumulative annual compounding 12 dividend based on the outstanding preferred share subscription price these interest holders have certain option rights to put the preferred and common share interests back to the company at a value based on the fair value of pa consulting the redemption values the primary inputs and assumptions impacting the fair value of pa consulting include projections of revenue and earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and discount rates applied thereto additionally the company has an option to call the interests for certain individual shareholders in certain circumstances because the interests are redeemable at the option of the holders and not solely within the control of the company the company classified the interests in redeemable noncontrolling interests within its consolidated balance sheet at their redemption values the optional redemption features may become exercisable no earlier than five years from the march 2 2021 closing date or upon the occurrence of certain other events 

the company has deemed these interests probable of becoming redeemable in the future and requiring their measurement at the greater of i the redemption amount that would be paid if settlement occurred at the balance sheet date or ii the historical value resulting from the original acquisition date fair value plus the impact of any earnings or loss attribution amounts including dividends the fair value of the pa consulting redeemable noncontrolling interest is determined using a combination of the income and market approaches under the income approach fair value is determined by using the projected discounted cash flows of pa consulting under the market approach the fair value is determined by reference to guideline companies that are reasonably comparable to pa consulting the fair value is estimated based on the valuation multiples of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization 

litigation investigations and insurance 

in the normal course of business we make contractual commitments and on occasion we are a party in litigation or arbitration proceedings the litigation in which we are involved primarily includes personal injury claims professional liability claims and breach of contract claims we are also routinely subject to investigations and audits 

page 53 

we maintain insurance coverage for most insurable aspects of our business and operations our insurance programs have varying coverage limits depending upon the type of insurance and include certain conditions and exclusions which insurance companies may raise in response to any claim that the company brings we have also elected to retain a portion of certain losses claims and liabilities that occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under our insurance programs and utilize a number of internal financing mechanisms for these self insurance arrangements including the operation of certain captive insurance entities as a result we may be subject to a future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured we intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of the contracts which the company enters with its clients our insurers are also subject to business risk and as a result one or more of them may be unable to fulfill their insurance obligations due to insolvency or otherwise 

our consolidated balance sheets include amounts representing our probable estimated liability relating to such claims litigation audits and investigations our estimates of probable liabilities require us to make assumptions related to potential losses regarding our determination of amounts considered probable and estimable 

the company believes after consultation with counsel that such litigation us government contractrelated audits investigations and claims and income tax audits and investigations should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements beyond amounts currently accrued 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date we recognize purchased intangible assets in connection with our business acquisitions at fair value on the acquisition date 

the goodwill carried on our consolidated balance sheets is tested annually for possible impairment and on an interim basis if indicators of possible impairment exist for purposes of impairment testing goodwill is assigned to the applicable reporting units based on the current reporting structure in performing the annual impairment test we evaluate our goodwill at the reporting unit level the company performs the annual goodwill impairment test for the reporting units at the beginning of the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 

we evaluate impairment of goodwill either by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or by performing a quantitative assessment qualitative factors include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and circumstances affecting the reporting unit if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and after considering the totality of events or circumstances we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we would perform a quantitative fair value test 

us gaap does not prescribe a specific valuation method for estimating the fair value of reporting units any valuation technique used to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including revenue growth rates operating margins discount rates and future market conditions among others 

we use income and market approaches to test our goodwill for possible impairment which requires us to make estimates and judgments under the income approach fair value is determined by using the discounted cash flows of our reporting units the company’s discount rate reflects a weighted average cost of capital “wacc” for a peer group of companies representative of the company’s respective reporting units under the market approach the fair values of our reporting units are determined by reference to guideline companies that are reasonably comparable to our reporting units the fair values are estimated based on the valuation multiples of the invested capital associated with the guideline companies in assessing whether there is an indication that the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired we utilize the results of both valuation techniques and consider the range of fair values indicated 

it is possible that changes in facts and circumstances judgments and assumptions used in estimating the fair value including with respect to market conditions and the economy could change resulting in possible impairment of goodwill in the future the fair values resulting from the valuation techniques used are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of the reporting units to willing third parties 

page 54 

for the 2022 fiscal year we have determined that the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values for the consolidated balance sheets presented and any analysis beyond the qualitative level was not considered necessary 

intangible assets with finite lives that arise from business acquisitions are amortized based on the period over which the contractual or economic benefit of the intangible assets are expected to be realized or on a straightline basis over the useful lives of the underlying assets these primarily consist of customer relationships contracts and backlog developed technology and trade names we assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our intangible assets when indicators of impairment are present based on expected future profitability and undiscounted expected cash flows and their contribution to overall operations should the review indicate that the carrying value is not fully recoverable the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the intangible assets would be recognized as an impairment loss

other income expense net was unfavorable 490 million for the current year compared to corresponding fiscal 2021 amounts due mainly to pretax fair value gains associated with our former investments in worley stock net of worley stock dividend and related foreign exchange items which was sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and c3 as defined in note 8 joint ventures vies and other investments of 347 million and 496 million respectively as well as higher interest expense of 275 million in the current year compared to the prior year due to higher outstanding levels of debt outstanding and higher interest rates additionally current year fiscal 2022 other income expense benefited from the absence of the prior year 386 million impairment charges of our investment in awe management ltd awe ml as well as a 139 million gain on sale of a cost investment and other favorable items during the current fiscal 2022 yeartodate period 

income taxes were lower in the current year by 1139 million due primarily to the absence of fiscal 2021 income taxes attributable to certain nondeductible compensation related charges associated with the companys pa consulting investment and fiscal 2021 256 million in tax law changes enacted in the united kingdom and the prior year change in valuation allowance of 389 million and other miscellaneous favorable tax items combined with current yeartodate tax benefits of 331 million for a change in the realizability of foreign tax credits due to a change in the us foreign tax credit regulations and 260 million for a change in judgment on the realizability of domestic deferred tax assets which are capital in nature 

finally unfavorable yearoveryear net earnings impacts associated with redeemable noncontrolling interests of 1200 million were attributable mainly to the absence of the 2021 period redeemable noncontrolling interests in connection with the noncontrolling interest portion of the onetime compensation charges incurred in the pa consulting investment mentioned above of approximately 91 million as well as the impact of the full yeartodate effects of the redeemable noncontrolling interests share of pa consultings operating results in fiscal 2022 fiscal 2021 earnings per share was impacted by the 044 per share impact of the value allocation update between preferred and common shares for the pa consulting investment

revenues for the year ended september 30 2022 were 1492 billion an increase of 8302 million or 59 from 1409 billion for the prior year the increase in revenues was due mainly to fiscal 2022 incremental revenues from the pa consulting investment completed in march 2021 the buffalo group acquisition in november 2020 and the streetlight and blacklynx acquisitions in fiscal year 2022 as well as revenue benefits from increased spending in our us government business sector client base these increases in revenues for the current year were partially offset by declines in pass through revenues in our pps advanced facilities business additionally the current fiscal year was unfavorably impacted by 1 certain large contract wind downs in the us and 2 foreign currency translation of 3463 million in our international businesses as compared to favorable impacts of 2386 million for the corresponding period last year

restructuring and other charges 

for discussion regarding restructuring and other charges see note 17 restructuring and other charges to the consolidated financial statements 

backlog information 

we include in backlog the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us our policy with respect to operations  maintenance om contracts however is to include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for one succeeding year regardless of the remaining life of the contract for national government programs other than national government om contracts which are subject to the same policy applicable to all other om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding option periods because of variations in the nature size expected duration funding commitments and the scope of services required by our contracts the timing of when backlog will be recognized as revenues can vary greatly between individual contracts 

page 62 

consistent with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the option of the client including our us government work while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog at any given time our backlog is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein backlog is not necessarily an indicator of future revenues 

because certain contracts eg contracts relating to large engineering procurement  construction epc projects as well as national government programs can cause large increases to backlog in the fiscal period in which we recognize the award and because many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over several fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years we evaluate our backlog generally on a yearoveryear basis but also on a sequential quarteroverquarter basis where appropriate 

please refer to item 1a risk factors  above for a discussion of other factors that may cause backlog to ultimately convert into revenues at different amounts 

the following table summarizes our backlog for the years ended september 30 2022 october 1 2021 and october 2 2020 in millions 

critical mission solutions backlog was generally consistent and in line with the prior year comparable period backlog critical mission solutions has been awarded a number of key opportunities in the us government space for the years presented 

the increase in backlog in people  places solutions for the years presented was primarily driven by new business awards in our advanced facilities business 

the pa consulting backlog was unfavorably impacted by the weakening british pound throughout the second half fiscal year 2022 excluding foreign currency impacts pa consulting backlog benefited from modest growth 

backlog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies totaled approximately 109 billion or 391 of total backlog 108 billion or 405 of total backlog and 85 billion or 357 of total backlog at september 30 2022 october 1 2021 and october 2 2020 respectively most of our federal government contracts require that services be provided beyond one year in general these contracts must be funded annually ie the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the us congress to the procuring agency and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts 

we estimate that approximately 940 billion or 337 of total backlog at september 30 2022 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year 

consolidated backlog differs from the company’s remaining performance obligations as defined by asc 606 primarily because of our national government contracts other than national government om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding the option periods while our remaining performance obligations represent a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress additionally the company includes our proportionate share of backlog related to unconsolidated joint ventures which is not included in our remaining performan ce obligations

liquidity and capital resources 

at september 30 2022 our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 114 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 114 billion of available borrowing capacity under our 225 billion revolving credit agreement the revolving credit facility we finance much of our operations and growth through cash generated by our operations 

the amount of cash and cash equivalents at september 30 2022 represented an increase of 1262 million from 101 billion at october 1 2021 the reasons for which are described below 

our cash flow provided by operations of 4747 million during fisc al 2022 was comparative ly lower than the 7263 million in cash flow provided by operations for the prior year this change was due primarily to the legacy ch2m matter cash settlement paid in the current fiscal year and the impact of the pa consulting postcompletion compensation payments made during the prior fiscal year with the absence of these two items resulting in nearflat yearoveryear cash flow from operations 

our cash used for investing activities for fiscal 2022 of 53842 million was comparatively lower than the 138 billion cash used for investing activities for the prior year the decrease was due primarily to the acquisitions of streetlight and blacklynx in the current year compared to the considerably larger prior year investment in pa consulting and the buffalo group acquisition partially offset by proceeds received from the companys disposal of the worley and c3 investments and the final ecr sale working capital settlement in fiscal 2021 

our cash provided by financing activit ies for the fiscal year ended 2022 of 3202 million resulted mainly from net proceeds from borrowings of 7190 million primarily in connection with the streetlight and blacklynx acquisitions and funding of the legacy ch2m matter cash settlement offset by cash used for share repurchases of 2819 million and 1159 million in dividends to shareholders cash provided by financing activities was 7990 million in fiscal 2021 and resulted mainly from net proceeds from borrowings of 122 billion partially offset by common stock repurchases of 2749 million and dividend payments to shareholders of 1072 million 

at september 30 2022 the company had approximately 2305 million in cash and cash equivalents held in the us and 9099 million held outside of the us primarily in the uk the eurozone australia india japan israel canada and the united arab emirates which is used primarily for funding operations in those regions other than the tax cost of repatriating funds to the us see note 7 income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k there are no material impediments to repatriating these funds to the us 

in connection with the companys implementation of a new holding company structure which was completed in august 2022 the company launched an offer to repurchase its outstanding senior notes as defined in note 9 borrowings at par plus accrued and unpaid interest and without any makewhole premium on october 7 2022 the company repaid 481 million of senior notes held by holders who accepted the offer with proceeds from our longterm revolving credit facility 

on april 12 2022 the company paid cash of aud640 million or approximately 475 million using midapril 2022 exchange rates which represented the final settlement of legacy ch2m matter for more information refer to note 19 contractual guarantees litigation investigations and insurance  

on february 4 2022 the company acquired streetlight data inc streetlight streetlight is a pioneer of mobility analytics who uses its data and machine learning resources to shed light on mobility and enable users to solve complex transportation problems the company paid total base consideration of approximately 1907 million in cash and issued 09 million in equity and 52 million in inthemoney stock options to the former owners of streetlight the company also paid off streetlights debt of approximately 10 million simultaneously with the consummation of the acquisition

on november 24 2020 a subsidiary of jacobs completed the acquisition of buffalo group a leader in advanced cyber and intelligence solutions which allows jacobs to further expand its cyber and intelligence solutions offerings to government clients the company paid total consideration o f 1901 million which was comprised of approximately 1824 million in cash to the former owners of buffalo group and contingent consideration of 77 million which was expected to be settled in fiscal 2022 see note 15 other business combinations for further discussion  

the company had 2805 million in letters of credit outstanding at september 30 2022 of this amount 13 million was issued under the revolving credit facility and 2792 million wa s issued under separate committed and uncommitted letterofcredit facilities

we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants at september 30 2022

energy chemicals and resources ecr 

ecr disposition 

on april 26 2019 jacobs completed the sale of its energy chemicals and resources ecr business to worley limited a company incorporated in australia worley for a purchase price of 34 billion consisting of i 28 billion in cash plus ii 582 million ordinary shares of worley subject to adjustments for changes in working capital and certain other items the ecr sale 

as a result of the ecr sale substantially all ecrrelated assets and liabilities were sold the disposal group we determined that the disposal group should be reported as discontinued operations in accordance with asc 21005 discontinued operations because their disposal represents a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results as such the financial results of the ecr business are reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings as discontinued operations for all periods presented additionally assets and liabilities of the ecr business were reflected as heldforsale in the consolidated balance sheets through september 27 2019 as of the year ended october 2 2020 all of the ecr business to be sold under the terms of the sale has been conveyed to worley and as such no amounts remained held for sale for further discussion see note 16 sale of energy chemicals and resources ecr business to the consolidated financial statements 

significant customers 

the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government for each of the last three fiscal years 



given the percentage of total revenue derived directly from the us federal government the loss of us federal government agencies as customers could have a material adverse effect on the company in addition any or all of our government contracts could be terminated we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work or payment of our costs could be disallowed approximately 83 of revenue derived directly from the us federal government is in the cms segment for more information on risks relating to our government contracts see item 1a  risk factors 

contracts 

while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake our contracts generally fall into two broad categories costreimbursable and fixedprice the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the last three fiscal years 



in accordance with industry practice most of our contracts including those with the us federal government are subject to termination at the discretion of the client which is discussed in greater detail in item 1a  risk factors  in such situations our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination 

page 15 

costreimbursable contracts 

costreimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit the profit element may be in the form of a simple markup applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee or a combination of a markup and a fee the fee element can also take several forms the fee may be a fixed amount it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred or it may be an incentive fee based on targets milestones or performance factors defined in the contract 

fixedprice contracts 

fixedprice contracts include both “lump sum bid” contracts and “negotiated fixedprice” contracts under lump sum bid contracts we typically bid against competitors based on clientfurnished specifications this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period additionally it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients which is contrary to our relationshipbased business model accordingly lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract in contrast under a negotiated fixedprice contract we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client negotiated fixedprice contracts frequently exist in singleresponsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project thus although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us in our services contracts as well as construction however because of economies that may be realized during the contract term both negotiated fixedprice and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts the company carefully manages the risk inherent in these types of contracts in recent years most of our fixedprice work has been either negotiated fixedprice contracts or lump sum bid contracts for design andor project services rather than turnkey construction 

competition 

we compete with a large number of companies across the world including technology consulting federal it services aerospace defense and engineering firms typically no single company or companies dominate the markets in which we provide services and in many cases we partner with our competitors or other companies to jointly pursue projects aecom booz allen caci kbr leidos parsons saic tetra tech wsp general dynamics northrop grumman accenture stantec montrose capgemini cognizant dxc technology fluor 3lharris quanta services snclavalin ibm infosys deloitte kpmg pwc icf international and huron are some of our competitors we compete based on the following factors among others technical capabilities reputation for quality price of services safety record availability of qualified personnel and ability to timely perform work and contract terms

risks related to our operations 

the covid19 pandemic including the measures that international federal state and local public health and other governmental authorities implement to address it have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

despite the availability of vaccines in some geographies covid19 continues to spread throughout the united states and globally including in regions where we have significant operations and personnel and uncertainties exist as to the efficacy of vaccines against new variants or mutations of covid19 to attempt to mitigate the spread of the pandemic there have been extraordinary and wideranging actions taken by international federal state and local public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak of covid19 in regions across the united states and around the world these actions include quarantines and “stayathome” or “shelterinplace” orders social distancing measures travel restrictions school closures and similar mandates for many individuals in order to substantially restrict daily activities and orders for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations unless their work is critical essential or lifesustaining and to require their employees to be vaccinated against covid19 as a condition for continued employment although there has been an easing of restrictions in certain jurisdictions some of these restrictions have been reinstated in other jurisdictions or could be reinstated in the future to manage a resurgence or new outbreak of covid19 including in connection with new variants or mutations of the virus in addition the reopening of businesses and economies in certain countries is creating a variety of new challenges including for example higher prices for goods and services limited availability of products and disruptions to supply chains as such the duration severity of its effects and ultimate impact to the world’s population and the global economy are still unknown 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect certain elements of our business including but not limited to the following 

• we have experienced and may continue to experience reductions in demand for certain of our services and the delay or abandonment of ongoing or anticipated projects due to our clients’ suppliers’ and other third parties’ diminished financial conditions or financial distress as well as governmental budget constraints these impacts are expected to continue or worsen if “stayathome” “shelterinplace” social distancing travel restrictions and other similar orders measures or restrictions remain in place for an extended period of time or are reimposed after being lifted or eased although we have experienced and may continue to experience an increase in demand for certain of our services as a result of new projects that have arisen in response to the covid19 pandemic there can be no assurance that any such increased demand would be sufficient to offset lost or delayed demand 

• governmentsponsored stimulus or assistance programs enacted todate in the united states and in the foreign countries in which we operate in response to the covid19 pandemic have only been available to us or our customers or suppliers on a limited basis and are insufficient to address the full impact of the covid19 pandemic these and other governmentsponsored assistance and stimulus programs are subject to renewal modification or termination by the applicable governing bodies if any governmentsponsored program from which we receive benefits is modified or terminated our benefits thereunder could decline or cease altogether which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

• our clients may be unable to meet their payment obligations to us in a timely manner including as a result of deteriorating financial condition or bankruptcy resulting from the covid19 pandemic and resulting economic impacts further other third parties such as suppliers subcontractors joint venture partners and other outside business partners may experience significant disruptions in their ability to satisfy their obligations with respect to us or they may be unable to do so altogether 

• while we have begun voluntary phased reopenings in our offices in accordance with guidance provided by government agencies the majority of our employees are currently still working remotely although many of our employees can effectively perform their responsibilities while working remotely some work is not wellsuited for remote work and that work may not be completed as efficiently as if it were performed on site additionally we may be exposed to unexpected cybersecurity risks and additional information technologyrelated expenses as a result of these remote working requirements in addition our management team has spent and will likely continue to spend significant time attention and resources monitoring the covid19 pandemic and seeking to manage its effects on our business and workforce a longterm continuation of these restrictions could among other things negatively impact employee morale and productivity any failure to 

page 23 

preserve our culture could harm our future success including our ability to retain and recruit personnel innovate and operate effectively and execute on our business strategy 

• consistent with public health guidance and executive order 14042 mandating covid19 vaccination for employees of businesses servicing federal contracts we have announced a company policy requiring full covid19 vaccinations of all employees in the united states and canada except for employees who qualify for medical or religious exemptions this policy along with the federal vaccine mandate may result in employee attrition and difficulty securing future labor needs and could impair our ability to perform certain contractual services to retain such contracts and to win new business all of which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations andor cash flows 

• illness travel restrictions or other workforce disruptions could adversely affect our supply chain our ability to timely and satisfactorily complete our clients’ projects our ability to provide services to our clients or our other business processes even after the covid19 pandemic subsides we could experience a longerterm impact on our operating expenses including for example the need for enhanced health and hygiene requirements or the periodic revival of social distancing or other measures in one or more regions in attempts to counteract future outbreaks 

• we may experience difficulties associated with hiring additional employees or replacing employees in particular with respect to roles that require security clearances or other special qualifications that may be limited or difficult to obtain as well as with effectively training and integrating new employees and in the short term to do so remotely during the covid19 pandemic increased turnover rates of our employees could increase operating costs and create challenges for us in maintaining high levels of employee awareness of and compliance with our internal procedures and external regulatory compliance requirements in addition to increasing our recruiting training and supervisory costs 

• in addition to existing travel restrictions implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic jurisdictions may continue to close borders impose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel and business activity which could materially impair our ability to support our operations and clients both domestic and international to source supplies through the global supply chain and to identify pursue and capture new business opportunities and which could continue to restrict the ability of our employees to access their workplaces we also face the possibility of increased overhead or other expenses resulting from compliance with any current and future government orders or other measures enacted in response to the covid19 pandemic 

• we operate in many countries around the world and certain of those countries’ governments may be unable to effectively mitigate the financial or other impacts of the covid19 pandemic on their economies and workforces and our operations therein 

the continued global spread of the covid19 pandemic and the responses thereto are complex and rapidly evolving and the extent to which the pandemic impacts our business financial condition and results of operations including the duration and magnitude of such impacts will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess covid19 and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic as well as reactions to future pandemics or resurgences of covid19 could also precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors that we identify in this annual report on form 10k which in turn could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations there may be other adverse consequences to our business financial condition and results of operations from the spread of covid19 that we have not considered or have not become apparent as a result we cannot assure you that if covid19 continues to spread it would not have a further adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

project sites are inherently dangerous workplaces failure to maintain safe work sites by us the owner or others working at the project site can lead to our employees or others becoming injured disabled or even losing their lives and exposes us to significant financial losses and reputational harm as well as civil and criminal liabilities 

project sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment moving vehicles chemical and manufacturing processes and highly regulated materials in a challenging environment and often in geographically remote locations the failure by us or others working at such sites to implement safety procedures or the implementation of ineffective procedures or the failure to implement and follow appropriate safety procedures subjects our employees and others to the risk of injury disability or loss of life and subjects us to risk that the completion or commencement of our projects may be delayed and we may be exposed to litigation or investigations unsafe work sites 

page 24 

also have the potential to increase employee turnover increase the cost of a project to our clients and raise our operating and insurance costs any of the foregoing could result in financial losses or reputational harm which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials and we are subject to the risk that the improper handling or disposal of such materials can lead to civil andor criminal liabilities we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health safety and environmental “hse” work procedures throughout our organization including project sites and maintenance sites the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability in addition despite the work of our functional groups we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel or that there will be no damage to or loss of our work equipment or supplies 

our safety record is critical to our reputation many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures accordingly if we fail to maintain adequate safety standards we could suffer reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the performance of these contracts 

our revenues are derived from new contract awards delays in the timing of the awards or cancellations of such projects as a result of economic conditions material and equipment pricing and availability or other factors could impact our longterm projected results it is particularly difficult to predict whether or when we will receive largescale projects as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process which is affected by a number of factors such as market conditions or governmental and environmental approvals since a significant portion of our revenues is generated from such projects our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards and the commencement or progress of work under awarded contracts furthermore many of these contracts are subject to financing contingencies and as a result we are subject to the risk that the customer will not be able to secure the necessary financing for the project 

in addition many of our contracts require us to satisfy specific progress or performance milestones in order to receive payment from the customer as a result we often incur significant costs for engineering materials components equipment labor or subcontractors prior to receipt of payment from a customer 

the uncertainty of our contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs in some cases we maintain and bear the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than necessary under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards when an expected contract award is delayed or not received we incur additional costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we engage in a highly competitive business if we are unable to compete effectively we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

we face intense competition to provide technical professional and construction management services to clients the markets we serve are highly competitive and we compete against a large number of regional national and multinational companies the extent and type of our competition varies by industry geographic area and project type 

our projects are frequently awarded through a competitive bidding process which is standard in our industry we are constantly competing for project awards based on pricing schedule and the breadth and technical sophistication of our services competition can place downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins which at times forces us to accept contractual terms and conditions that are less favorable to us thereby increasing the risk that among other things we may not realize profit margins at the same rates as we have seen in the past or may become responsible for costs or other liabilities we have not accepted in the past if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both which if significant could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

page 25 

the nature of our contracts particularly those that are fixedprice subjects us to risks of cost overruns we may experience reduced profits or in some cases losses if costs increase above budgets or estimates or if the project experiences schedule delays 

for fiscal 2021 approximately 24 of our revenues were earned under fixedprice contracts both fixedprice and many cost reimbursable contracts require us to estimate the total cost of the project in advance of our performance for fixedprice contracts we may benefit from any costsavings but we bear greater risk of paying some if not all of any cost overruns fixedprice contracts are established in part on partial or incomplete designs cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions including those about future economic conditions commodity and other materials pricing and cost and availability of labor including the cost of any related benefits or entitlements equipment and materials and other exigencies cost overruns can occur leading to reduced profits or in some cases a loss for that project for a variety of reasons including if the design or the estimates prove inaccurate or if circumstances change due to among other things unanticipated technical problems difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals changes in local laws or labor conditions weather or other delays beyond our control changes in the costs of equipment or raw materials our vendors’ or subcontractors’ inability or failure to perform or changes in general economic conditions these risks are exacerbated for projects with longterm durations because there is an increased risk that the circumstances on which we based our original estimates will change in a manner that increases costs if the project is significant or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our contracts that are fundamentally cost reimbursable in nature may also present a risk to the extent the final cost on a project exceeds the amount the customer expected or budgeted like fixedprice contracts the expected cost of costreimbursable projects is based in part on partial design and our estimates of the resources and time necessary to perform such contracts a portion of the fee is often linked to these estimates and the related final cost and schedule objectives and if for whatever reason these objectives are not met the project may be less profitable than we expect or even result in losses 

if we or any of our subsidiaries or companies in which we have made strategic investments lose or experience a significant reduction in business from one or a few customers it could have a material adverse impact on us 

a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue andor backlog or the revenue andor backlog for our subsidiaries or companies in which we have made strategic investments  in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years for example in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 approximately 33 33 and 27 respectively of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government although we have longstanding relationships with many of our significant clients our clients may unilaterally reduce delay or cancel their contracts at any time if we or any of our subsidiaries or companies in which we have made strategic investments lose or experience a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted canceled or suspended by our clients and therefore our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings additionally even if fully performed our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins 

backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us as of the end of fiscal 2021 our backlog totaled approximately 266 billion there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or if realized will result in profits in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation termination or suspension at the discretion of the client including our us government work in the event of a project cancellation we would generally have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project the risk of contracts in backlog being canceled or suspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns or in response to changes in commodity prices 

the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts the revenue for certain contracts included in backlog is based on estimates additionally the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence future profitability 

in some markets there is a continuing trend towards costreimbursable contracts with incentivefee arrangements typically our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs overall 

page 26 

safety performance overall client satisfaction and other performance criteria if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards we may receive a lower or even zero incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins accordingly there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog assuming they produce the revenues currently expected will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies which are a significant source of our revenue and profit are subject to various uncertainties restrictions and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities as well as profit and cost controls which could result in withholding or delay of payments to us government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding such as sequestration and budget deficits contracts with the us federal government for example are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding us government shutdowns or any related understaffing of the government departments or agencies that interact with our business could result in program cancellations disruptions andor stop work orders could limit the government’s ability to effectively progress programs and make timely payments and could limit our ability to perform on our existing us government contracts and successfully compete for new work governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for government programs may even be eliminated legislatures typically appropriate funds on a yearbyyear basis while contract performance may take more than one year the us government may also shift its spending focus away from areas such as defense and space exploration and towards other areas in which we do not currently provide services as a result contracts with government agencies may be only partially funded or may be terminated and we may not realize all of the potential revenue and profit from those contracts 

our government clients may reduce the scope of or terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues for example those with the us federal government represented approximately 33 of our total revenue in fiscal 2021 a significant reduction in government funding or the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

most government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process the us federal government has increasingly relied upon multipleyear contracts with multiple contractors that generally require those contractors to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under a contract this process may result in us facing significant additional pricing pressure and uncertainty and incurring additional costs moreover we may not be awarded government contracts because of existing policies designed to protect small businesses and underrepresented minorities our inability to win new contracts or be awarded work under existing contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socioeconomic requirements which affect how we transact business with our clients and in some instances impose additional costs on our business operations for example for contracts with the us federal government we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation the truth in negotiations act the cost accounting standards and numerous regulations governing environmental protection and employment practices government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than nongovernment contracts this includes for example unlimited indemnification obligations 

we also are subject to government audits investigations and proceedings for example government agencies such as the us defense contract audit agency routinely review and audit us to determine the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies and whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations these audits can result in a determination that a rule or regulation has been violated or that adjustments are necessary to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies 

if we violate a rule or regulation fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit a variety of penalties can be imposed on us including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties for example in socalled “qui tam” actions brought by individuals or the government under the us federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws treble damages can be awarded in addition any or all of our government contracts could be terminated we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work or payment of our costs could be 

page 27 

disallowed the occurrence of any of these actions could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances which can be difficult and time consuming to obtain if our employees or our facilities are unable to obtain or retain the necessary security clearances our clients could terminate or not renew existing contracts or award us new contracts which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

our project execution activities may result in liability for faulty services 

failure to provide our services in accordance with applicable professional standards or contractual requirements exposes us to significant monetary damages or even criminal violations our engineering practice for example involves professional judgments regarding the planning design development construction operations and management of industrial facilities and public infrastructure projects while we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages in our contracts and although we have adopted a range of insurance risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities a catastrophic event at one of our project sites or completed projects resulting from the services we have performed could result in significant professional or product liability and warranty or other claims against us as well as reputational harm especially if public safety is impacted these liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or the fees we generate may not be covered by insurance at all due to various exclusions in our coverage and could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future further even where coverage applies the policies have limits and deductibles or retentions which results in our assumption of exposure for certain amounts with respect to any claim filed against us in addition clients or subcontractors who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us an uninsured claim either in part or in whole as well as any claim covered by insurance but subject to a policy limit high deductible andor retention if successful and of a material magnitude could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation 

we are a party to claims and litigation in the normal course of business including litigation inherited through acquisitions since we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities and projects where design construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or others we are exposed to substantial claims and litigation and investigations due to the failure at any such facility or project such claims could relate to among other things personal injury loss of life business interruption property damage or pollution and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties such as those who use or reside near our clients’ projects we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met in many of our contracts with clients subcontractors and vendors we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages penalties losses and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts in addition while clients and subcontractors may agree to indemnify us against certain liabilities such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us 

with a workforce of approximately 55000 people globally we are also party to labor and employment claims in the normal course of business certain of these claims relate to allegations of harassment and discrimination pay equity denial of benefits wage and hour violations whistleblower protections concerted protected activity and other employment protections and may be pursued on an individual or class action basis depending on applicable laws and regulations some of such claims may be insurable while other such claims may not 

we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations our insurance programs have varying coverage limits as well as exclusions for matters such as fraud and insurance companies can and sometimes do attempt to deny claims for which we seek coverage in addition we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles retentions and limits under these programs as a result we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured 

although in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future or that such insurance can be economically secured for example catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits coverage that is more limited increased premium costs or higher deductibles andor retentions we monitor the financial health of the insurance companies from which we 

page 28 

procure insurance which is one of the factors we take into account when purchasing insurance our insurance is purchased from a number of the worlds leading providers often in layered insurance or quota share arrangements if any of our third party insurers fail abruptly cancel our coverage or otherwise cannot satisfy their insurance requirements to us then our overall risk exposure and operational expenses could be increased and our business operations could be interrupted 

in addition the nature of our business sometimes results in clients subcontractors and vendors presenting claims to us for among other things recovery of costs related to certain projects similarly we occasionally present change orders and claims to our clients subcontractors and vendors for among other things additional costs exceeding the original contract price if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients subcontractors and vendors we will likely incur cost overruns reduced profits or in some cases a loss for a project further these claims can be the subject of lengthy negotiations arbitration or litigation proceedings which could result in the investment of significant amounts of working capital pending the resolution of the relevant change orders and claims a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results additionally irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant 

litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability product liability criminal liability warranty obligations default under our credit agreements and other liabilities which to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation 

our use of joint ventures partnerships and strategic investments in entities exposes us to risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control 

as is common in our industry we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures partnerships and similar arrangements this situation exposes us to a number of risks including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients 

further we have limited ability to control the actions of our joint venture partners including with respect to nonperformance default bankruptcy or legal or regulatory compliance our partners may be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships if these circumstances occur we may be liable for claims and losses attributable to the partner by operation of law or contract these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend on the management effectiveness of our joint venture partners differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major issues which could materially affect the business and operations of these ventures in addition in many of the countries in which we engage in joint ventures it may be difficult to enforce our contractual rights under the applicable joint venture agreement if we are not able to enforce our contractual rights we may not be able to realize the benefits of the joint venture or we may be subject to additional liabilities 

we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner in these cases we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the failure by a joint venture partner to comply with applicable laws regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and for government clients could result in fines penalties suspension or even debarment being imposed on us which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts 

thirdparty subcontractors we hire perform a significant amount of the work performed under our contracts we also rely on thirdparty equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for 

page 29 

projects if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers our ability to successfully complete a project will be impaired if we are not able to locate qualified thirdparty subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated especially in a lump sum or a fixedprice contract we may suffer losses on these contracts if a subcontractor supplier or manufacturer fails to provide services supplies parts or equipment as required under a contract for any reason or fails to provide such services supplies parts or equipment in accordance with applicable quality standards as required by the contract or regulation we will be required to source these services equipment parts or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms which could impact contract profitability andor could result in claims against us for damages we are subject to disputes with our subcontractors from time to time relating to among other things the quality and timeliness of work performed customer concerns about the subcontractor or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a contract in addition faulty workmanship equipment or materials would likely impact the overall project which could result in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications 

in an uncertain or downturn economic environment third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party’s ability to provide materials equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a failure by a third party subcontractor supplier or manufacturer to comply with applicable laws regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and for government clients could result in fines penalties suspension or even debarment being imposed on us which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

employee agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts which could result in reduced revenues and profits 

we are subject to the risk of misconduct fraud noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or other improper activities by one of our employees agents or partners which could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation such misconduct includes the failure to comply with government procurement regulations regulations regarding the protection of classified information regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts regulations on lobbying or similar activities regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting regulations pertaining to export control environmental laws employee wages pay and benefits and any other applicable laws or regulations for example we routinely provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters if a security breach were to occur our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective and we could face unknown risks or losses our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct subjects us to the risk of fines and penalties cancellation of contracts loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting any of which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our international operations are exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies 

for fiscal 2021 approximately 31 o f our revenue was earned from clients outside the us our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues our international operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

• recessions and other economic crises in other regions such as europe or specific foreign economies and the impact on our costs of doing business in those countries 

• difficulties in staffing and managing foreign personnel and operations including challenges related to logistics communications and professional licensure of our international workforce 

• unexpected changes in foreign government policies and regulatory requirements 

• potential noncompliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations including anticorruption export control and antiboycott laws and similar nonus laws and regulations 

• potential noncompliance with regulations and evolving industry standards regarding consumer protection and data use and security including the general data protection regulation approved by the european union 

page 30 

• lack of developed legal systems to enforce contractual rights 

• expropriation and nationalization of our assets in a foreign country 

• renegotiation or nullification of our existing contracts 

• the adoption of new and the expansion of existing trade or other restrictions 

• embargoes duties tariffs or other trade restrictions including sanctions 

• geopolitical developments that impact our or our clients’ ability to operate in a foreign country 

• changes in labor conditions 

• acts of war civil unrest force majeure and terrorism 

• the ability to finance efficiently our foreign operations 

• social political and economic instability 

• changes to tax policy 

• currency exchange rate fluctuations 

• limitations on the ability to repatriate foreign earnings and 

• us government policy changes in relation to the foreign countries in which we operate 

the lack of a welldeveloped legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights in addition military action geopolitical shifts or continued unrest particularly in the middle east impacts the supply or pricing of oil and could disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere and increase our security costs moreover recent events including change in us trade policies and responsive changes in policy by foreign jurisdictions and similar geopolitical developments and uncertainty in the eu asia and elsewhere have increased levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and may increase the volatility of global financial markets and the global and regional economies to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic political and other conditions our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we work in international locations where there are high security risks which could result in harm to our employees or unanticipated cost 

some of our services are performed in highrisk locations where the country or location is subject to political social or economic risks or war terrorism or civil unrest in those locations where we have employees or operations we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel despite these activities in these locations we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel and we may suffer future losses of employees and subcontractors acts of terrorism and threats of armed conflicts in or around various areas in which we operate could limit or disrupt markets and our operations including disruptions resulting from the evacuation of personnel cancellation of contracts or the loss of key employees contractors or assets 

cyber security or privacy breaches or systems and information technology interruption or failure could adversely impact our ability to operate or expose us to significant financial losses and reputational harm 

we rely heavily on computer information and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business from time to time we experience system interruptions and delays in the event we are unable to regularly deploy software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems the operation of such systems could be subjected to additional interruption or could result in the loss corruption or release of data in addition our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters force majeure events telecommunications failures power loss acts of war or terrorism computer viruses malicious code physical or electronic security breaches intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error or similar events or disruptions any of these or other events could cause interruptions delays loss of critical andor sensitive data or similar effects which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition protection of intellectual property and results of operations as well as those of our clients 

our information technology systems which have grown over time including through acquisitions are vulnerable to failure malicious intrusion and attack these systems have and will continue to experience threats including 

page 31 

unauthorized access computer hackers computer viruses malicious code ransomware phishing organized cyberattacks and other security problems and system disruptions including unauthorized access to and disclosure of our and our clients’ proprietary or classified information such tactics have caused and may also seek to cause in the future payments due to or from the company to be misdirected to fraudulent accounts which may not be recoverable by the company 

while we have security measures and technology in place designed to protect our and our clients’ proprietary or classified information there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent all threats to our computer systems if our security measures and technology fail as a result of a cyberattack other thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and someone obtains unauthorized access to our or our clients’ information our reputation could be damaged our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures as a result we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of system disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these disruptions and breaches any of these events could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition new laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information including the european union general data protection regulation gdpr the california consumer privacy act and other emerging us state and global privacy laws pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate costs and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties and legal liability 

we continuously evaluate the need to upgrade andor replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our computing environment to stay current on vendor supported products and to improve the efficiency of our systems and for other business reasons the implementation of new systems and information technology could adversely impact our operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems in addition our systems implementations may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated systems implementation disruption and any other information technology disruption if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to professional standards duties and statutory obligations on professional reports and opinions we issue which could subject us to monetary damages 

we issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional engineering expertise as well as our other professional credentials that subject us to professional standards duties and obligations regulating the performance of our services for example we issue opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings if a client or another third party alleges that our report or opinion is incorrect or it is improperly relied upon and we are held responsible we could be subject to significant monetary damages in addition our reports and other work product may need to comply with professional standards licensing requirements securities regulations and other laws and rules governing the performance of professional services in the jurisdiction where the services are performed we could be liable to third parties who use or rely upon our reports and other work product even if we are not contractually bound to those third parties these events could in turn result in monetary damages and penalties 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or that of our clients 

our technology and intellectual property provide us in certain instances with a competitive advantage although we seek to protect our property through registration licensing contractual arrangements security controls and similar mechanisms we may not be able to successfully preserve our rights and they could be invalidated circumvented challenged or become obsolete trade secrets are generally difficult to protect our employees and contractors are subject to confidentiality obligations but this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information andor infringement of our intellectual property in addition the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the us if we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights even if ultimately successful could be costly and could divert leadership’s attention away from other aspects of our business 

page 32 

we also hold licenses from third parties which may be utilized in our business operations if we are no longer able to license such technology on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise our business and financial performance could be adversely affected 

if our intellectual property rights or work processes become obsolete we may not be able to differentiate our service offerings and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers our competitors may independently attempt to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies 

our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property there is a risk we may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and as a result could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities loss of contracts or other consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we do not have adequate indemnification for our nuclear services it could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the priceanderson nuclear industries indemnity act commonly called the priceanderson act “paa” is a us federal law which among other things regulates radioactive materials and the nuclear energy industry including liability and compensation in the event of nuclear related incidents the paa provides certain protections and indemnification to nuclear energy plant operators and us department of energy “doe” contractors the paa protections and indemnification apply to us as part of our services to the us nuclear energy industry and doe for new facilities maintenance modification decontamination and decommissioning of nuclear energy weapons and research facilities 

we offer similar services in other jurisdictions outside the us for those jurisdictions varying levels of nuclear liability protection is provided by international treaties andor domestic laws such as the nuclear liability and compensation act of canada and the nuclear installations act of the united kingdom insurance andor assets of the nuclear installation operators some of which are backed by governments as well as under appropriate enforceable contractual indemnifications and holdharmless provisions these protections and indemnifications however may not cover all of our liability that could arise in the performance of these services to the extent the paa or other protections and indemnifications do not apply to our services the cost of losses associated with liability not covered by the available protections and indemnifications or by virtue of our loss of business because of these added costs could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements 

in preparing our financial statements our leadership is required under us gaap to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities areas requiring significant estimates by our leadership include

our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

an impairment charge on our goodwill or intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

because we have grown in part through acquisitions goodwill and intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets under us gaap we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach we also assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our intangible assets when indications of impairment are present based on expected future probability and undiscounted expected cash flows and their contribution to our overall operations as of october 1 2021 we had 720 billion of goodwill representing 492 of our total assets of 1463 billion we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the beginning of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business potential government actions toward our facilities and other factors 

if our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value we could be required to record an impairment charge the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing please see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 

impairment of longlived assets or restructuring activities may require us to record a significant charge to earnings 

our longlived assets including our lease rightofuse assets equity investments and others are subject to periodic testing for impairment failure to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow at the asset group level has resulted in and could result in additional impairment of our longlived assets further changes in the business environment could lead to changes in the scope of operations of our business these changes including the closure of one or more offices could result in restructuring andor asset impairment charges the covid19 pandemic raises the possibility of an extended global economic downturn which increase the risk of longlived asset impairment charges 

we may be required to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and postretirement benefit plans we manage or for which we have contribution andor funding obligations 

we have various employee benefit plan obligations that require us to make contributions to satisfy over time our underfunded benefit obligations which are generally determined by calculating the projected benefit obligations minus the fair value of plan assets for example as of october 1 2021 and october 2 2020 our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by 1914 million and 4004 million respectively see note 13 pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k for additional disclosure in the future our benefit plan obligations may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of interest rates pension plan asset performance and other factors if we are required to contribute a significant amount of the deficit for underfunded benefit plans our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

we are also a participating employer in various multiemployer pension plans mepps associated with some of the work we perform on a union basis which mepps are managed by third party trusts and over which we have no control including as to how the mepps are managed or financial investment decisions are made if any of these mepps is underfunded we could face the imposition of underfunded liability or withdrawal liability at a materially adverse level 

page 34 

negotiations with labor unions and possible work actions could disrupt operations and increase labor costs and operating expenses 

a certain portion of our work force has entered into and additional portions may in the future enter into collective bargaining agreements which on occasion may require renegotiation the outcome of future negotiations relating to union representation or collective bargaining agreements may not be favorable to the company in that they may increase our operating expenses and lower our net income as a result of higher wages or benefit expenses in addition negotiations with unions diverts management attention and could disrupt operations which may adversely affect our results of operations if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements we may have to address the threat of unioninitiated work actions including work slowdowns and strikes depending on the nature of the threat or the type and duration of any work action these actions could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

demand for our services is cyclical as the sectors and industries in which our clients operate are impacted by economic downturns reductions in government or private spending and times of political uncertainty 

we provide full spectrum technical and professional solutions to clients operating in a number of sectors and industries including programs for various national governments including the us federal government aerospace automotive pharmaceuticals and biotechnology infrastructure environmental and nuclear buildings smart cities power water transportation telecom and other general industrial and consumer businesses and sectors these sectors and industries and the resulting demand for our services have been and we expect will continue to be cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control including economic conditions and changes in client spending particularly during periods of economic or political uncertainty 

uncertain global economic and political conditions may negatively impact our clients’ ability and willingness to fund their projects including their ability to raise capital and pay or timely pay our invoices these factors may also cause our clients to reduce their capital expenditures alter the mix of services purchased seek more favorable price and other contract terms and otherwise slow their spending on our services for example in the public sector declines in state and local tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending in addition under such conditions many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable these conditions may reduce the demand for our services which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally uncertain economic and political conditions may make it difficult for our clients our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities for example changes to us policies related to global trade and tariffs during the former administration have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future of the global economy as well as retaliatory trade measures implemented by other countries the increasing cost of steel and aluminum may impact client spending we cannot predict the outcome of changing trade policies or other unanticipated political conditions nor can we predict the timing strength or duration of any economic recovery or downturn worldwide or in our clients’ markets in addition our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and therefore may not recover as quickly as the economy at large weak economic conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations on november 15 2021 president biden signed into law the infrastructure investment and jobs act while the act provides for funding in many of the markets in which the company operates the timing of the award of projects funded by the act is uncertain and the company may not be able to obtain the expected benefits from the act or any other infrastructure or stimulus spending furthermore if a significant portion of our clients or projects are concentrated in a specific geographic area or industry our business may be disproportionately affected by negative trends or economic downturns in those specific geographic areas or industries 

regardless of economic or market conditions investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients’ markets and investment decisions as a result our past results have varied and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate 

page 35 

our operations may be impacted by the united kingdom’s exit from the european union 

in june 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” the uk formally exited the eu on january 30 2020 pursuant to a withdrawal agreement between the uk government and the eu upon its withdrawal pursuant to an agreement reached between the uk and the eu a transition period came into effect which ended on december 31 2020 from which time the uk withdrew from the eu single market and customs union on december 24 2020 the eu and the uk agreed the terms of a trade and cooperation agreement which sets out the terms of their future relationship which we refer to as the trade agreement the trade agreement was approved by the uk parliament and applied provisionally until the end of april 2021 when the european parliament approved the trade agreement the trade agreement offers uk and eu businesses preferential access to each other’s markets ensuring imported goods will be free of tariffs and quotas however economic relations between the uk and the eu will now be on more restricted terms than before and there remains uncertainty around the postbrexit regulatory environment as the provisions of the trade agreement do not cover the services sector 

these restrictions may adversely affect our relationships with our existing and future customers suppliers employees and subcontractors or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the diverging regulatory environments also add additional complexity to our compliance programs this uncertainty could cause significant economic disruption and further depress consumer confidence and the economy of the uk  which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs terminate or reduce the scope of existing contracts decrease or postpone currently planned contracts or negotiate for more favorable deal terms each of which may have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

rising inflation interest rates andor construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts in particular with respect to our fixedprice contracts 

rising inflation interest rates or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services in addition we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixedprice because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from costreimbursable type contracts approximately 76 during fiscal 2021 the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor however if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixedprice and lumpsum work is more prevalent inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future therefore increases in inflation interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects 

our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects both positive and negative that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar into the us dollar while we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in the currencies of our expenditures we do enter into contracts that expose us to currency risk particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs we attempt to minimize our exposure from currency risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies or entering into derivative hedging instruments when there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts these actions however may not always eliminate currency risk exposure the governments of certain countries have or may in the future impose restrictive exchange controls on local currencies and it may not be possible for us to engage in effective hedging transactions to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in a particular currency based on fluctuations in currency the us dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly we may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries 

page 36 

our global presence could give rise to material fluctuations in our income tax rates 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation the introduction of new tax accounting standards legislation regulations and related interpretations our global mix of earnings the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate or an ultimate determination that the company owes more taxes than the amounts previously accrued could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control 

extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control such as natural or manmade disasters could negatively impact our ability to operate as an example from time to time we face unexpected severe weather conditions which may result in weatherrelated delays that are not always reimbursable under a fixedprice contract evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services increased labor and material costs in areas resulting from weatherrelated damage and subsequent increased demand for labor and materials for repairing and rebuilding inability to deliver materials equipment and personnel to job sites in accordance with contract schedules and loss of productivity we may remain obligated to perform our services after any such natural or manmade event unless a force majeure clause or other contractual provision provides us with relief from our contractual obligations if we are not able to react quickly to such events or if a high concentration of our projects are in a specific geographic region that suffers from a natural or manmade catastrophe our operations may be significantly affected which could have a material adverse impact on our operations in addition if we cannot complete our contracts on time we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients which may reduce our profits 

fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers’ investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation delays in existing work or changes in the timing and funding of new awards 

commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways for example for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil gas copper or fertilizers fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and therefore their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments furthermore declines in commodity prices can negatively impact our business in regions whose economies are substantially dependent on commodity prices such as the middle east to the extent commodity prices decline or fluctuate and our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects the demand for our services decreases which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned as well as those in progress and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel 

the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel including engineers architects designers craft personnel and corporate leadership professionals who have the required experience and expertise at a reasonable cost the market for these and other personnel is competitive from time to time it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients or to replace such personnel when needed in a timely manner in certain geographic areas for example we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel furthermore some of our personnel hold government granted clearance that may be required to obtain government projects if we were to lose some or all of these personnel they would be difficult to replace loss of the services of or failure to recruit qualified technical and leadership personnel could limit our ability to successfully complete existing projects and compete for new projects 

in addition in the event that any of our key personnel retire or otherwise leave the company we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans which requires devoting time and 

page 37 

resources toward identifying and integrating new personnel into leadership roles and other key positions if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions and strategic investments to sustain our growth these transactions present certain risks and uncertainties 

our business strategy involves growth through among other things the acquisition of and strategic investments in other companies for example we acquired ch2m in december 2017 keyw in june 2019 john wood group’s nuclear business in march 2020 and buffalo group in november 2020 and we completed a strategic investment in pa consulting in march 2021 these transactions present a number of risks including 

• assumption of liabilities of an acquired business including liabilities that were unknown at the time the transaction was negotiated 

• failure of the target company to comply with us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations andor contractual requirements with government clients 

• valuation methodologies may not accurately capture the value of the target companys business 

• failure to realize anticipated benefits such as cost savings synergies business opportunities and growth opportunities 

• the loss of key customers or suppliers including as a result of any actual or perceived conflicts of interest 

• difficulties or delays in obtaining regulatory approvals licenses and permits 

• difficulties relating to combining previously separate entities into a single integrated and efficient business 

• for strategic investments in which we do not acquire 100 of the target company the other equity holders may have consent rights over certain actions taken by the company 

• in the event a target company continues to operate as a standalone company it may result in additional costs 

• the effects of diverting leadership’s attention from daytoday operations to matters involving the integration of target companies 

• potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations strategic investments andor divestitures 

• potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition or investment or postclosing deterioration in the target companys business 

• difficulties relating to assimilating the leadership personnel benefits services and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities 

• difficulties retaining key personnel of the target company 

• increased burdens on our staff and on our administrative internal control and operating systems which may hinder our legal and regulatory compliance activities 

• difficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to the target company 

• increased financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning treasury management financial reporting and internal controls 

• the potential requirement for additional equity or debt financing which may not be available or if available may not have favorable terms and 

• the risks discussed in this item 1a risk factors that may relate to the activities of the acquired business prior to the acquisition 

while we may obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses andor insurance that could mitigate certain of these risks such rights may be difficult to enforce the losses may exceed any dedicated escrow funds and the indemnitors may not have the ability to financially support the indemnity or the insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover all losses 

if our leadership is unable to successfully integrate acquired companies or implement our growth strategy with respect to acquisitions andor strategic investments our operating results could be harmed in addition we may not realize the full benefits of an acquisition or strategic investments including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all moreover we cannot assure that we will continue to successfully expand or that growth or expansion will result in profitability 

page 38 

in addition there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition or investment targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us existing cash balances and cash flow from operations together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities may be insufficient to make acquisitions andor strategic investments future acquisitions andor strategic investments may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing which may not be available on attractive terms or at all acquisitions andor strategic investments may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 

acquisitions strategic investments and divestitures create various business risks and uncertainties during the pendency of the transaction 

consummation of any merger strategic investment or divestiture is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions including one or more of the following i due diligence and its associated time and cost commitments ii board and shareholder approval iii regulatory approvals iv the absence of any legal restraint that would prevent the consummation of the transaction v the absence of material adverse conditions which can prevent the consummation of the transaction and vi compliance with covenants and the accuracy of representations and warranties contained in the transaction agreement among others one or more of these conditions may not be fulfilled and accordingly the transaction may not be consummated or may be significantly delayed in such case our ongoing business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the market price of our common stock may decline particularly to the extent that the market price reflects a market assumption that the transaction will be consummated or will be consummated within a particular timeframe 

furthermore most transactions require the company to incur substantial expense associated with closing and if the transaction is not consummated we will incur these expenses without realizing the expected benefits the pursuit of the transaction will also require management attention and use of internal resources that would otherwise be focused on general business operations in addition customers’ uncertainty about the effect of the transaction may have an adverse effect on the ability to win customer contracts or could cause existing clients to seek to change existing business relationships employee morale due to the uncertainties associated with the transaction could also be negatively affected any of the foregoing or other risks arising in connection with a failure or delay in consummating a transaction including the diversion of management attention or loss of other opportunities during the pendency of the transaction could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may make minority investments that subject us to risks and uncertainties outside of our control 

from time to time the company may make minority investments in the equity securities of companies that we do not control minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational andor compliance risks associated with the minority investment 

to the extent we hold only a minority equity interest in a company we may lack affirmative control rights which may diminish our ability to influence the company’s affairs in a manner intended to enhance the value of our investment in the company we could incur losses if the majority stakeholders or the management of the company takes risks or otherwise acts in a manner that does not serve our interests in addition we could be subject to reputational harm if the company in which the investment is made makes business financial or management decisions with which we do not agree these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with management or employees of the company in which the investment is made or its other stockholders 

in most cases the companies in which we make investments will have indebtedness or equity securities or may be permitted to incur indebtedness or to issue equity securities that rank senior to our investment we also may make investments in earlystage companies that depend on venture funding and are not profitable in the event of insolvency liquidation dissolution reorganization or bankruptcy of a company in which an investment is made holders of debt instruments and securities ranking senior to our investment would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before distributions could be made in respect of our investment 

we may also enter into separate commercial arrangements with these companies whether before concurrently with or after making such minority investment in certain cases the commercial arrangement may be a driving factor behind our investment we cannot assure you that that the commercial arrangement will further our business strategy as we expected we may not realize all the economic benefits expected from the commercial agreement or realize the expected return on our investments 

page 39 

unavailability or cancellation of thirdparty insurance coverage could increase our overall risk exposure as well as disrupt the management of our business operations 

we maintain insurance coverage from thirdparty insurers as part of our overall risk management strategy and because some of our contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage limits if any of our thirdparty insurers fail suddenly cancel our coverage or otherwise are unable to provide us with adequate insurance coverage then our overall risk exposure and our operational expenses could increase and the management of our business operations could be disrupted in addition there can be no assurance that any of our existing insurance coverage will be renewable upon the expiration of the coverage period or that future coverage will be affordable at the required limits 

assertions by third parties of infringement misappropriation or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business financial condition and operation results 

in recent years there has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights in technology industries we may face from time to time allegations that we or a supplier or customer have violated the rights of third parties including patent trademark and other intellectual property rights if with respect to any claim against us for violation of thirdparty intellectual property rights we are unable to prevail in the litigation or retain or obtain sufficient rights or develop noninfringing intellectual property or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely or costefficient basis our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

any infringement misappropriation or related claims whether or not meritorious are time consuming divert technical and management personnel and are costly to resolve as a result of any such dispute we may have to develop noninfringing technology pay damages enter into royalty or licensing agreements cease utilizing products or services or take other actions to resolve the claims these actions if required may be costly or unavailable on terms acceptable to us 

our professional reputation and relationships with us government agencies are critical to our business and any harm to our reputation or relationships could decrease the amount of business the us government does with us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a significant portion of our revenue is earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government if our reputation or relationships with these agencies were harmed our future revenue and growth prospects would be materially and adversely affected our reputation and relationship with the us government is a key factor in maintaining and growing revenue under contracts with the us government negative press reports regarding poor contract performance employee misconduct information security breaches engagements in or perceived connections to politically or socially sensitive activities or other aspects of our business or regarding government contractors generally could harm our reputation in addition to the extent our performance under a contract does not meet a us government agency’s expectations the client might seek to terminate the contract prior to its scheduled expiration date provide a negative assessment of our performance to governmentmaintained contractor pastperformance data repositories fail to award us additional business under existing contracts or otherwise and direct future business to our competitors if our reputation or relationships with these agencies are negatively affected or if we are suspended or debarred from contracting with government agencies for any reason such actions would decrease the amount of business that the us government does with us which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our focus on new growth areas for our business entails risks including those associated with new relationships clients talent needs capabilities service offerings and maintaining our collaborative culture and core values 

we are focused on growing our presence in our addressable markets by expanding our relationships with existing clients developing new clients by leveraging our core competencies further developing our existing capabilities and service offerings creating new capabilities and service offerings to address our clients emerging needs and undertaking business development efforts focused on identifying nearterm developments and longterm trends that may pose significant challenges for our clients these efforts entail inherent risks associated with innovation and competition from other participants in those areas potential failure to help our clients respond to the challenges they face our ability to comply with uncertain evolving legal standards applicable to certain of our service offerings including those in the cybersecurity area and with respect to potential international growth risks associated with operating in foreign jurisdictions such as compliance with applicable foreign and us laws and regulations that may impose different and occasionally conflicting or contradictory requirements and the economic legal and political conditions in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate as we attempt to develop new relationships clients capabilities and service offerings these efforts could harm our results of operations due to among other things a diversion of our focus and resources and actual costs opportunity costs of pursuing these opportunities in lieu of others and a failure to reach a profitable return on 

page 40 

our investments in new technologies capabilities and businesses including expenses on research and development investments and these efforts could ultimately be unsuccessful 

the needs of our customers change and evolve regularly and in particular due to complex and rapidly changing technologies our success depends upon our ability to identify emerging technological trends develop technologically advanced innovative and costeffective products and services and market these products and services to our customers our success also depends on our continued access to suppliers of important technologies and components t he possibility exists that our competitors might develop new capabilities or service offerings that might cause our existing capabilities and service offerings to become obsolete if we fail in our new capabilities development efforts or our capabilities or services fail to achieve market acceptance more rapidly than our competitors our ability to procure new contracts could be negatively impacted which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

our ability to grow our business by leveraging our operating model to efficiently and effectively deploy our people across our client base is also largely dependent on our ability to maintain our collaborative culture to the extent that we are unable to maintain our culture for any reason including our effort to focus on new growth areas we may be unable to grow our business any such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

in addition with the growth of our us and international operations we provide client services and undertake business development efforts in numerous and disparate geographic locations both domestically and internationally our ability to effectively serve our clients is dependent upon our ability to successfully leverage our operating model across all of these and any future locations maintain effective management controls over all of our locations to ensure among other things compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations and instill our core values in all of our personnel at each of these and any future locations any inability to ensure any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

risks related to regulatory compliance 

past and future environmental health and safety laws could impose significant additional costs and liabilities 

we are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities 

various us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants the liability under these laws may be joint and several we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen cleanup obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

when we perform our services our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions we are subject to liability claims by employees customers and third parties as a result of such exposures in addition we are subject to fines penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws a claim if not covered or only partially covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

health safety and environmental laws and regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes thereto could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could for example relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and in turn could negatively impact our revenue changes in the environmental laws and regulations remediation obligations enforcement actions stricter interpretations of existing requirements future discovery of contamination or claims for damages to persons property natural resources or the environment could result in material costs and liabilities that we currently do not anticipate failure to comply with any environmental health or safety laws or regulations whether actual 

page 41 

or alleged exposes us to fines penalties or potential litigation liabilities including costs settlements and judgments any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments which requires us or our clients to obtain and to comply with federal state and local government permits and approvals these permits or approvals are subject to denial revocation or modification under various circumstances failure to obtain or comply with or the loss or modification of the conditions of permits or approvals subjects us to the risk of penalties or other liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and result of operations 

if we fail to comply with federal state local or foreign governmental requirements our business may be adversely affected 

we are subject to us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business for example our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders which requires compliance with both export regulatory laws and international trafficking in arms regulations “itar” although we have policies and procedures to comply with us and foreign international trade laws the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges or debarment from participation in us government contracts and could damage our reputation and our ability to do business 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act of 2010 and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices despite our training and compliance programs there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions including contract cancellations or debarment and loss of reputation any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to climate change 

climate change and related environmental issues could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

climate change related events such as increased frequency and severity of storms floods wildfires droughts hurricanes freezing conditions and other natural disasters may have a longterm impact on our business financial condition and results of operation while we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change we recognize that there are inherent climate related risks regardless of where we conduct our businesses for example a catastrophic natural disaster could negatively impact any of our office locations and the locations of our customers access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business is critical to our operations accordingly a natural disaster has the potential to disrupt our and our customers’ businesses and may cause us to experience work stoppages project delays financial losses and additional costs to resume operations including increased insurance costs or loss of cover legal liability and reputational losses 

further the risks caused by climate change span across the full spectrum of the industry sectors we serve our services and solutions span water energy the natural and built environment transportation national security cyber and aerospace the direct physical risks that climate change poses to infrastructure through chronic environmental changes such as rising sea levels and temperatures and acute events such as hurricanes droughts and wildfires is common to each of these sectors infrastructure owners could face increased costs to maintain their assets which could result in reduced profitability and fewer resources for strategic investment these types of physical risks could in turn lead to transitional risks ie the degree to which society responds to the threat of climate change such as market and technology shifts including decreased demand for our services and solutions reputational risks such as how our values and practices 

page 42 

regarding a low carbon transition are viewed by external and internal stakeholders and policy and legal risks such as the extent to which low carbon transitions are driven by the governments in which we operate around the globe all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change 

growing public concern about climate change has resulted in the increased focus of local state regional national and international regulatory bodies on ghg emissions and climate change issues legislation to regulate ghg emissions has periodically been introduced in the us congress and there has been a wideranging policy debate both in the united states and internationally regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation the biden administration has made climate change and the limitation of ghg emissions one of its initial and primary objectives for example in january 2021 president biden signed a number of executive orders with respect to ghgs including one recommitting the united states to the paris agreement pursuant to which nearly 200 nations have committed to reduce global emissions additionally president biden announced the united states’ nationally determined contribution ndc under the paris agreement at his summit on climate change on april 22 2021 the target aims to reduce us emissions by 5052 compared to a 2005 baseline by 2030 several states and geographic regions in the united states have also adopted legislation and regulations to reduce emissions of ghgs additional legislation or regulation by these states and regions the us environmental protection agency andor any international agreements to which the united states may become a party that control or limit ghg emissions or otherwise seek to address climate change could result in increased compliance costs for us and our clients and have other impacts on our clients including those who are involved in the exploration production or refining of fossil fuels emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels or emit greenhouse gases through the mining manufacture utilization or production of materials or goods in addition the recent announcement of the methane reduction pledge as part of the glasgow climate pact agreed at cop26 could also have implications for some of our clients’ businesses such policy changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or in some cases prevent a project from going forward thereby potentially reducing the need for our services which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations further climate legislation across all geographies poses a similar risk to us and our clients as we operate globally however policy changes and climate legislation could also increase the overall demand for our services as our clients and partners work to comply with such policies such as by decarbonizing their industries transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources and developing integrated and sustainable solutions which could have a positive impact on our business we cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers 

we may be unable to achieve our climate commitments and targets 

at jacobs we have committed to help solve the climate crisis by setting ambitious climate commitments and targets including our goal to be carbon negative for our operations and business travel however achievement of our climate commitments and targets including our carbon negative goal is subject to risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to our ability to execute our operational strategies and achieve our goals within the currently projected costs and the expected timeframes the availability and cost of alternative fuels global electrical charging infrastructure offsite renewable energy and other materials and components unforeseen design operational and technological difficulties the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments including the ability to scale projects and technologies on a commercially competitive basis such as carbon sequestration andor other related processes compliance with and changes or additions to global and regional regulations taxes charges mandates or requirements relating to ghg emissions carbon costs or climaterelated goals laborrelated regulations and requirements that restrict or prohibit our ability to impose requirements on third party contractors adapting products to customer preferences and customer acceptance of sustainable supply chain solutions the actions of competitors and competitive pressures an acquisition of or merger with another company that has not adopted similar carbon negative goals or whose progress towards reaching its carbon negative goals is not as advanced as ours and the pace of regional and global recovery from the covid19 pandemic accordingly there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our operational strategies and achieve our climate commitments and targets 

while our climate commitments and targets are ambitious we believe that they are realistic and achievable we have also developed a roadmap for implementation of our carbon reduction goals and our global emissions reduction trajectory suggests that we are on the pathway to meet our targets however we also recognize that some of our emission reductions over the past two years may have been primarily the result of the global covid19 pandemic our roadmap recognizes this and we are putting measures in place now to ensure that we remain on that same trajectory however we cannot guarantee that such measures will be successful failure to achieve our climate commitments and targets could damage our reputation and our customer and other stakeholder relationships further investors have recently increased their focus on environmental social and governance matters including practices related to ghgs and climate change an increasing percentage of the investment community considers sustainability factors in making investment decisions and 

page 43 

an increasing number of entities are considering sustainability factors in awarding business if we are unable to meet our climate commitments and targets and appropriately address sustainability enhancement we may lose investors customers or partners our stock price may be negatively impacted our reputation may be negatively affected and it may be more difficult for us to compete effectively all of which would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as well as on the price of our common stock 

risks related to our indebtedness 

we rely on cash provided by operations and liquidity under our credit facilities to fund our business negative conditions in the credit and financial markets and delays in receiving client payments could adversely affect our cost of borrowing and our business 

although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions we are currently a borrower under several credit facilities these facilities all contain customary covenants restricting among other things our ability to incur certain liens and indebtedness we are also subject to certain financial covenants including maintenance of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio a breach of any covenant or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under one or more of our credit facilities and limit our ability to do further borrowing instability in the credit markets in the us or abroad could cause the availability of credit to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain at competitive rates on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts this situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds refinance our existing indebtedness enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all we may also enter into business acquisition agreements that require us to access credit which if not available at the closing of the acquisition could result in a breach of the acquisition agreement and a resulting claim for damages by the sellers of such business in addition market conditions could negatively impact our clients’ ability to fund their projects and therefore utilize our services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors suppliers and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements on less favorable terms with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

some of our customers suppliers and subcontractors depend on access to commercial financing and capital markets to fund their operations disruptions of the credit or capital markets could adversely affect our clients’ ability to finance projects and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions project delays and payment delays or defaults by our clients in addition clients may be unable to fund new projects may choose to make fewer capital expenditures or otherwise slow their spending on our services or to seek contract terms more favorable to them our government clients may face budget deficits that prohibit them from funding proposed and existing projects or that cause them to exercise their right to terminate our contracts with little or no prior notice in addition any financial difficulties suffered by our subcontractors or suppliers could increase our cost or adversely impact project schedules these disruptions could materially impact our backlog and have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are therefore subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices after we have already committed resources to their projects in weak economic environments we may experience increased delays and failures due to among other reasons our clients’ unwillingness to pay for alleged poor performance or to preserve their own working capital if one or more clients delays in paying or fails to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

furthermore our cash balances and shortterm investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america europe south america australia and asia some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership or have been seized by their governments there is 

page 44 

a risk that such events may occur in the future if any such events were to occur we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

maintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts 

in line with industry practice we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds or letters of credit to our customers these instruments indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract if a bond or a letter of credit is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond or letter of credit we cannot pursue that project historically we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity but as is typically the case the issuance of a bond is at the surety’s sole discretion and the issuance of a letter of credit is based on the companys creditworthiness because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms in addition future projects may require us to obtain letters of credit that extend beyond the term of our existing credit facilities our inability to obtain adequate bonding and as a result to bid on new contracts that require such bonding or letter of credit could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to our common stock 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly or fall below the expectations of securities analysts which could have a material adverse impact on the price of our common stock fluctuations are caused by a number of factors including 

• legal proceedings disputes andor government investigations 

• fluctuations in the spending patterns of our government and commercial customers 

• the number and significance of projects executed during a quarter 

• unanticipated changes in contract performance particularly with contracts that have funding limits 

• the timing of resolving change orders requests for equitable adjustments and other contract adjustments 

• delays incurred in connection with a project 

• changes in prices of commodities or other supplies 

• changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

• weather conditions that delay work at project sites 

• the timing of expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions or other corporate initiatives 

• the decision by the board of directors to begin or cease paying a dividend and the expectation that if the company pays dividends it would declare dividends at the same or higher levels in the future 

• natural disasters or other crises 

• staff levels and utilization rates 

• changes in prices of services offered by our competitors and 

• general economic and political conditions 

there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends on our common stock 

our board of directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program in fiscal 2017 under which we have paid and intend to continue paying regular quarterly dividends the declaration amount and timing of such dividends are subject to capital availability and determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and applicable agreements our ability to pay dividends will depend upon among other factors our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions 

page 45 

including acquisitions debt service requirements results of operations financial condition and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant a reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments andor our dividend program could have a material negative effect on our stock price 

in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make we could dilute share ownership and if we receive stock in connection with a divestiture the value of stock is subject to fluctuation 

one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities if we issue additional equity securities such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders’ individual ownership percentages in the company 

in addition if we receive stock or other equity securities in connection with a sale or divestiture of a business the value of such stock will fluctuate andor be subject to trading restrictions stock price changes may result from among other things changes in the business operations or prospects of the issuer prior to or following the transaction litigation or regulatory considerations general business market industry or economic conditions the ability to sell all or a portion of the stock based on current market conditions and other factors both within and beyond the control of the company in addition if the stock received is valued in a currency other than us dollars the value of such stock will also fluctuate based on foreign currency rates 

delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control 

we are a delaware corporation certain antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us in addition certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover for example 

• only our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board 

• there are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election and 

• our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preferred shares 

these types of provisions as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders accordingly shareholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares

critical accounting policies and estimates 

page 48 

in order to better understand the changes that occur to key elements of our financial condition results of operations and cash flows a reader of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business performing longterm professional services engineering and constructiontype contracts requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect both the entity’s results of operations and the carrying values of its assets and liabilities although our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k the following discussion is intended to highlight and describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue accounting for contracts 

engineering procurement  construction contracts and service contracts 

on september 29 2018 the company adopted asc topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers including the subsequent asus that amended and clarified the related guidance the company recognizes engineering procurement and construction contract revenue over time as performance obligations are satisfied due to the continuous transfer of control to the customer upon adoption of asc topic 606 contracts which include engineering procurement and construction services are generally accounted for as a single deliverable a single performance obligation and are no longer segmented between types of services in some instances the company’s services associated with a construction activity are limited only to specific tasks such as customer support consulting or supervisory services in these instances the services are typically identified as separate performance obligations 

the company recognizes revenue using the percentageofcompletion method based primarily on contract costs incurred to date compared to total estimated contract costs estimated contract costs include the company’s latest estimates using judgments with respect to labor hours and costs materials and subcontractor costs the percentageofcompletion method an input method is the most representative depiction of the company’s performance because it directly measures the value of the services transferred to the customer subcontractor materials labor and equipment and in certain cases customerfurnished materials and labor and equipment are included in revenue and cost of revenue when management believes that the company is acting as a principal rather than as an agent eg the company integrates the materials labor and equipment into the deliverables promised to the customer or is otherwise primarily responsible for fulfillment and acceptability of the materials labor andor equipment the company recognizes revenue but not profit on certain uninstalled materials that are not specifically produced fabricated or constructed for a project under the typical payment terms of our engineering procurement and construction contracts amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreedupon contractual terms at periodic intervals eg biweekly or monthly and customer payments on are typically due within 30 to 60 days of billing depending on the contract 

for service contracts the company recognizes revenue over time using the costtocost percentageofcompletion method service contracts that include multiple performance obligations are segmented between types of services for contracts with multiple performance obligations the company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation using an estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct service in the contract in some instances where the company is standing ready to provide services the company recognizes revenue ratably over the service period under the typical payment terms of our service contracts amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreedupon contractual terms and customer payments are typically due within 30 to 60 days of billing depending on the contract 

direct costs of contracts include all costs incurred in connection with and directly for the benefit of client contracts including depreciation and amortization relating to assets used in providing the services required by the related projects the level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors including the amount of passthrough costs we incur during a period on those projects where we are acting as principal for subcontract labor or thirdparty materials and equipment we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs and we refer to such costs as “passthrough costs” 

variable consideration 

page 49 

the nature of the company’s contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration including claims and unpriced change orders awards and incentive fees and liquidated damages and penalties the company recognizes revenue for variable consideration when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur the company estimates the amount of revenue to be recognized on variable consideration using the expected value ie the sum of a probabilityweighted amount or the most likely amount method whichever is expected to better predict the amount if the requirements for recognizing revenue for claims or unapproved change orders are met revenue is recorded only when the costs associated with the claims or unapproved change orders have been incurred and only up to the amount of cost incurred 

practical expedient 

if the company has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the company’s performance completed to date a service contract in which the company bills a fixed amount for each hour of service provided the company recognizes revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice for services performed 

joint ventures and vies 

as is common to the industry we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures although the joint ventures own and hold the contracts with the clients the services required by the contracts are typically performed by us and our joint venture partners or by other subcontractors under subcontracting agreements with the joint ventures many of these joint ventures are formed for a specific project the assets of our joint ventures generally consist almost entirely of cash and receivables representing amounts due from clients and the liabilities of our joint ventures generally consist almost entirely of amounts due to the joint venture partners for services provided by the partners to the joint ventures under their individual subcontracts and other subcontractors in general at any given time the equity of our joint ventures represents the undistributed profits earned on contracts the joint ventures hold with clients very few of our joint ventures have employees or thirdparty debt or credit facilities the debt held by the joint ventures is nonrecourse to the general credit of jacobs 

our unconsolidated joint ventures including equity method investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable and impairment losses are recognized for such investments if there is a decline in fair value below carrying value that is considered to be otherthantemporary 

many of the joint ventures are deemed to be variable interest entities “vie” because they lack sufficient equity to finance the activities of the joint venture the company uses a qualitative approach to determine if the company is the primary beneficiary of the vie which considers factors that indicate a party has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the joint venture’s economic performance these factors include the composition of the governing board how board decisions are approved the powers granted to the operational managers and partner that holds that positions and to a certain extent the partner’s economic interest in the joint venture the company analyzes each joint venture initially to determine if it should be consolidated or unconsolidated 

• consolidated if the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie or holds the majority of voting interests of a nonvie and no significant participative rights are available to the other partners 

• unconsolidated if the company is not the primary beneficiary of a vie or does not hold the majority of voting interest of a nonvie 

sharebased payments 

we measure the value of services received from employees and directors in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grantdate fair value of the award the computed value is recognized as a noncash cost on a straightline basis over the period the individual provides services which is typically the vesting period of the award with the exception of the value of awards containing an internal performance measure such as eps growth and roic which is recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period subject to the probability of meeting the performance requirements and adjusted for the number of shares expected to be earned 

accounting for pension plans 

the accounting for pension plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans’ assets and liabilities these assumptions include discount rates investment returns 

page 50 

and projected salary increases among others the actuarial assumptions used in determining the funded statuses of the plans are provided in note 13 pension and other postretirement benefit plans of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

the expected rates of return on plan assets ranged from 18 to 7 for fiscal 2021 and range from 2 to 7 fiscal 2022 we believe the range of rates selected for fiscal 2022 reflects the longterm returns expected on the plans’ assets considering recent market conditions projected rates of inflation the diversification of the plans’ assets and the expected real rates of market returns the discount rates used to compute plan liabilities ranged from 04 to 66 in fiscal 2021 and range of 06 to 66 in fiscal 2022 these assumptions represent the company’s best estimate of the rates at which its pension obligations could be effectively settled 

changes in the actuarial assumptions often have a material effect on the values assigned to plan assets and liabilities and the associated pension expense for example if the discount rate used to value the net pension benefit obligation “pbo” at october 1 2021 was higher by 05 the pbo would have been lower at that date by approximately 2294 million for nonus plans and by approximately 205 million f or us plans if the expected return on plan assets was higher by 10 the net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2021 would be lower by approximately 212 million for nonus plans and by approximately 34 million for us plans differences between actuarial assumptions and actual performance ie actuarial gains and losses that are not recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost in the period in which such differences arise are recorded to accumulated other comprehensi ve income loss and are recognized as part of net periodic pension cost in future periods in accordance with us gaap management monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in an effort to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used 

page 51 

redeemable noncontrolling interests 

in connection with the pa consulting investment the company recorded redeemable noncontrolling interests representing the interest holders 35 equity interest in the form of preferred and common shares of pa consulting the preferred shares are entitled to a cumulative annual compounding 12 dividend based on the outstanding preferred share subscription price these interest holders have certain option rights to put the preferred and common share interests back to the company at a value based on the fair value of pa consulting the redemption values additionally the company has an option to call the interests for certain individual shareholders in certain circumstances because the interests are redeemable at the option of the holders and not solely within the control of the company the company classified the interests in redeemable noncontrolling interests within its consolidated balance sheet at their redemption values the optional redemption features may become exercisable no earlier than five years from the march 2 2021 closing date or upon the occurrence of certain other events 

the company has deemed these interests probable of becoming redeemable in the future and requiring their measurement at the greater of i the redemption amount that would be paid if settlement occurred at the balance sheet date or ii the historical value resulting from the original acquisition date fair value plus the impact of any earnings or loss attribution amounts including dividends the fair value of the the pa consulting redeemable noncontrolling interests is determined using an income and market approach 

further any excess in redemption amounts over the historical values of the interests is recognized as an increase to redeemable noncontrolling interests and an offsetting decrease in consolidated retained earnings additionally particular to the preference share and in certain circumstances the ordinary share components of redeemable noncontrolling interests such decrease in consolidated retained earnings is also reflected as a corresponding downward adjustment to net earnings attributable to jacobs for purposes of the calculation of consolidated earnings per share attributable to common shareholders 

contractual guarantees litigation investigations and insurance 

in the normal course of business we make contractual commitments some of which are supported by separate guarantees and on occasion we are a party in a litigation or arbitration proceeding the litigation in which we are involved primarily includes personal injury claims professional liability claims and breach of contract claims where we provide a separate guarantee it is strictly in support of the underlying contractual commitment guarantees take various forms including surety bonds required by law or standby letters of credit loc also referred to as “bank guarantees” or corporate guarantees given to induce a party to enter into a contract with a subsidiary standby locs are also used as security for advance payments or in various other transactions the guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from an arbitrary date to completion of our work eg engineering only to completion of the overall project we record in the consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such guarantees litigation and insurance claims guarantees are accounted for in accordance with asc 46010 guarantees  at fair value at the inception of the guarantee 

we maintain insurance coverage for most insurable aspects of our business and operations our insurance programs have varying coverage limits depending upon the type of insurance and include certain conditions and exclusions which insurance companies may raise in response to any claim that the company brings we have also elected to retain a portion of losses and liabilities that occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under our insurance programs as a result we may be subject to a future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured we intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of the contracts which the company enters with its clients our insurers are also subject to business risk and as a result one or more of them may be unable to fulfill their insurance obligations due to insolvency or otherwise 

our consolidated balance sheets include amounts representing our probable estimated liability relating to such claims guarantees litigation audits and investigations our estimates of probable liabilities require us to make assumptions related to potential losses regarding our determination of amounts considered probable and estimable we perform an analysis to determine the level of reserves to establish for insurancerelated claims that are known and have been asserted against us as well as for insurancerelated claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates we include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations insurance recoveries are recorded as assets if recovery is probable and estimated liabilities are not reduced by expected insurance recoveries 

page 52 

the company believes after consultation with counsel that such guarantees litigation us government contractrelated audits investigations and claims and income tax audits and investigations should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements beyond amounts currently accrued 

testing goodwill for possible impairment 

the goodwill carried on our consolidated balance sheets is tested annually for possible impairment and on an interim basis if indicators of possible impairment exist for purposes of impairment testing goodwill is assigned to the applicable reporting units based on the current reporting structure in performing the annual impairment test we evaluate our goodwill at the reporting unit level the company performs the annual goodwill impairment test for the reporting units at the beginning of the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 

we evaluate impairment of goodwill either by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or by performing a quantitative assessment qualitative factors include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and circumstances affecting the reporting unit if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and after considering the totality of events or circumstances we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we would perform a quantitative fair value test 

us gaap does not prescribe a specific valuation method for estimating the fair value of reporting units any valuation technique used to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including revenue growth rates operating margins discount rates and future market conditions among others 

we use income and market approaches to test our goodwill for possible impairment which requires us to make estimates and judgments under the income approach fair value is determined by using the discounted cash flows of our reporting units the company’s discount rate reflects a weighted average cost of capital “wacc” for a peer group of companies representative of the company’s respective reporting units under the market approach the fair values of our reporting units are determined by reference to guideline companies that are reasonably comparable to our reporting units the fair values are estimated based on the valuation multiples of the invested capital associated with the guideline companies in assessing whether there is an indication that the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired we utilize the results of both valuation techniques and consider the range of fair values indicated 

it is possible that changes in market conditions economy facts and circumstances judgments and assumptions used in estimating the fair value could change resulting in possible impairment of goodwill in the future the fair values resulting from the valuation techniques used are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of the reporting units to willing third parties 

for the 2021 fiscal year we have determined that the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values for the consolidated balance sheets presented and any analysis beyond the qualitative level was not considered necessary

fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 

revenues for the year ended october 1 2021 were 1409 billion an increase of 5257 million or 39 from 1357 billion for the prior year the increase in revenues was due partly to fiscal 2021 incremental revenues from the pa consulting investment completed in march 2021 the buffalo group business acquisition completed in november 2020 and the march 2020 john wood group nuclear business acquisition in addition reve nue growth benefited from favorable foreign currency translation of 2386 million for the year ended october 1 2021 in our international businesses as compared to unfavorable impacts of 308 million for the corresponding period last year the current year benefits were partially offset by market conditions and certain contract wind downs in our us businesses and the extra week of activity in fiscal 2020  

passthrough costs included in revenues for the year ended october 1 2021 were 238 billion in comparison to 261 billion in the prior year in general passthrough costs are more significant on projects that have a higher content of field services activities passthrough costs are generally incurred at specific points during the life cycle of a project and are highly dependent on the needs of our individual clients and the nature of the clients’ projects however because we have hundreds of projects that start at various times within a fiscal year the effect of passthrough costs on the level of direct costs of contracts can vary between fiscal years without there being a fundamental or significant change to the underlying business 

gross profit for the year ended october 1 2021 was 304 billion up 4571 million or 177 from 259 billion for the prior year our gross profit margins were 216 and 191 for the years ended october 1 2021 and october 2 2020 respectively the increase in our gross profit and gross profit margins were mainly attributable to the recent business acquisition s mentioned along with favorable foreign currency translation impacts in our international businesses partially offset by market conditions and certain contract wind downs in our us businesses and the extra week of activity in fiscal 2020 as noted above

selling general  administrative expenses for the year ended october 1 2021 were 236 billion an increase of 3050 million or 149 from 205 billion for the prior year the current years results were impacted by incremental sga expenses from the recent business acquisitions mentioned above and higher personnelrelated costs partly offset by lower other operational overhead costs and the extra week of activity in fiscal 2020 additionally restructuring and other charges for fiscal 2021 were mainly attributable to postcompletion compensation expense of 261 million in connection with the investment in pa consulting while fiscal 2020 included 3251 million of restructuring and other charges and transaction costs associated in part with the companys fourth quarter fiscal 2020 transformation initiatives relating to real estate and other staffing programs incremental sga expenses from the abovementioned business acquisitions have been offset in part b y continued reductions in personnelrelated and other overhead costs resulting from our ongoing cost reduction programs unfavorable impacts on sga expenses from foreign exchange were 759 million for the year ended october 1 2021 as compared to nominal favorable impacts for the corresponding period last year 

net interest expense for the year ended october 1 2021 was 692 million an increase of 117 million from 575 million for the prior year the increase in net interest expense year over year is primarily due to the higher levels of debt outstanding in the current year as a result of the pa acquisition partially offset by lower interest rates 

miscellaneous income expense net for the year ended october 1 2021 was 767 million an increase of 1140 million as compared to 373 million in expense for the prior year the increase from the prior year was due primarily to 347 million in pretax net gains associated with changes in the fair value of our investment in worley stock net of worley stock dividend which was sold in fourth quarter fiscal 2021 and certain foreign currency revaluations relating to the ecr sale in the current year compared to pretax net losses of 745 million in the prior year also included in miscellaneous expense income during the current year are pretax realized gains of 496 million related to holdings of our c3 shares sold during the period as further discussed in note 11  joint ventures vies and other investments these favorable impacts for fiscal 2021 were partially offset by otherthantemporary impairment charges on our investment in awe in the amount of 386 million

in evaluating the company’s performance by operating segment the codm reviews various metrics and statistical data for each line of business lob and pa consulting but focuses primarily on revenues and operating profit as discussed above segment operating profit includes not only local sga expenses but the sga expenses of the company’s support groups that have been allocated to the segments in addition the company attributes each segments specific incentive compensation plan costs to the segments the revenues of the people  places solutions lob are more affected by passthrough revenues than the critical mission solutions lob or the pa consulting segment the methods for recognizing revenue incentive fees project losses and change orders are consistent among the segments 

critical mission solutions 

critical mission solutions cms segment revenues for the year ended october 1 2021 were 509 billion up 1211 million or 24 from 497 billion for the prior year our increase in revenue was primarily attributable to incremental revenue from the buffalo group and john wood group nuclear business acquisitions there was also comparable revenue growth from most elements of our legacy portfolio driven by increased spending by customers in the us government business sector and our legacy international clients mitigated by several large contracts winding down in the us and one less week of activity as compared to fiscal year end 2020 impacts on revenues from favorable foreign currency translation were approximately 618 million for the year ended october 1 2021 compared to 45 million in unfavorable impacts in the corresponding prior year 

operating profit for the segment was 4472 million for the year ended october 1 2021 up 751 million or 202 from 3721 million for the prior year the increases from the prior year were primarily attributable to incremental operating profit from the buffalo group and john wood group nuclear business acquisitions and the continued growth in profits from our us governmental business sector and our legacy international business impacts on operating profit from favorable forei gn currency translation were approximatel y 97 million for t he year ended october 1 2021 compared to 04 million in unfavorable impacts in the corresponding prior year 

people  places solutions 

revenues for the people  places solutions pps segment for the year ended october 1 2021 were 838 billion down 2228 million or 26 from 860 billion for the prior year the decrease in revenue was driven by softer market conditions in our advanced facilities business and one less week of activity during fiscal year ended october 1 2021 as compared to the prior year these items were partially offset by 1768 million in favorable foreign currency translation in our international business for the year ended october 1 2021 compared to 262 million in unfavorable impacts in the corresponding prior year 

operating profit for the segment for the year ended october 1 2021 was 7804 million an increase of 397 million or 54 from 7407 million for the comparative period in 2020 the yearoveryear increase is primarily related to lower spend on travel discretionary operating expenditures and other operating expenditures and real estate transformation initiatives enacted in fiscal year 2020 impacts on operating profit from favorable foreign currency translation were approximately 309 million for the year ended october 1 2021 compared to 61 million in unfavorable impacts in the corresponding prior year in addition these were partially offset by 195 million in net charges related to a legal settlement for the year ended october 1 2021 

page 59 

pa consulting 

revenues and operating profit for the pa consulting segment for the year ended october 1 2021 were 6274 million and 1511 million respectively there were no comparable periods in the prior year given the transaction closed on march 2 2021 

other corporate expenses 

other corporate expenses were 3401 million 2494 million and 2644 million for the years ended october 1 2021 october 2 2020 and september 27 2019 respectively the increase from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 was due primarily to higher intangible amortization expense from the pa consulting investment and the buffalo group and john wood group nuclear business acquisitions as well as impacts from company benefit program enhancements these increases were partly offset by employee related and other cost reductions across the companys corporate functions 

included in other corporate expenses in the above table are costs and expenses that relate to general corporate activities as well as corporatemanaged benefit and insurance programs such costs and expenses include i those elements of sga expenses relating to the business as a whole ii those elements of our incentive compensation plans relating to corporate personnel whose other compensation costs are not allocated to the lobs iii the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations iv the quarterly variances between the company’s actual costs of certain of its selfinsured integrated risk and employee benefit programs and amounts charged to the lobs and v certain adjustments relating to costs associated with the company’s international defined benefit pension plans in addition other corporate expenses may also include from time to time certain adjustments to contract margins both positive and negative associated with projects as well as other items where it has been determined that such adjustments are not indicative of the performance of the related lob 

restructuring and other charges 

for discussion regarding restructuring and other charges see note 17 restructuring and other charges to the consolidated financial statements 

backlog information 

we include in backlog the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us our policy with respect to operations  maintenance om contracts however is to include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for one succeeding year regardless of the remaining life of the contract for national government programs other than national government om contracts which are subject to the same policy applicable to all other om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding option periods because of variations in the nature size expected duration funding commitments and the scope of services required by our contracts the timing of when backlog will be recognized as revenues can vary greatly between individual contracts 

consistent with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the option of the client including our us government work while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog at any given time our backlog is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein backlog is not necessarily an indicator of future revenues 

because certain contracts eg contracts relating to large engineering procurement  construction epc projects as well as national government programs can cause large increases to backlog in the fiscal period in which we recognize the award and because many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over several fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years we evaluate our backlog generally on a yearoveryear basis but also on a sequential quarteroverquarter basis where appropriate 

page 60 

please refer to item 1a risk factors  above for a discussion of other factors that may cause backlog to ultimately convert into revenues at different amounts 

the following table summarizes our backlog for the years ended october 1 2021 october 2 2020 and september 27 2019 in millions 

the increase in backlog in critical mission solutions for the years presented was primarily the result of the acquisition of buffalo group and conversion of the other robust cms pipeline 

the increase in backlog in people  places solutions for the years presented was primarily the result of new awards in the uk and us markets 

backlog in pa consulting as of october 1 2021 was 3036 million the pa consulting transaction closed on march 2 2021 

backlog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies totaled approximately 108 billion or 405 of total backlog 85 billion or 357 of total backlog and 88 billion or 391 of total backlog at october 1 2021 october 2 2020 and september 27 2019 respectively most of our federal government contracts require that services be provided beyond one year in general these contracts must be funded annually ie the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the us congress to the procuring agency and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts 

we estimate that approximately 850 billion or 319 of total backlog at october 1 2021 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year 

consolidated backlog differs from the company’s remaining performance obligations as defined by asc 606 primarily because of our national government contracts other than national government om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding the option periods while our remaining performance obligations represent a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress additionally the company includes our proportionate share of backlog related to unconsolidated joint ventures which is not included in our remaining performan ce obligations 

for a discussion on the year ended october 2 2020 compared to the year ended september 27 2019 please refer to part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended october 2 2020 

liquidity and capital resources 

at october 1 2021 our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 101 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 192 billion of available borrowing capacity under our 225 billion revolving credit agreement the revolving credit facility we finance much of our operations and growth through cash generated by our operations 

the amount of cash and cash equivalents at october 1 2021 represented an increase of 1518 million from 8624 million at october 2 2020 the reasons for which are described below 

our cash flow provided by operations of 7263 million during fisc al 2021 was comparatively lower than the 8068 million in cash flow provided by operations for the prior year this change was due primarily to unfavorable impacts from net cash earnings driven by 261 million in cash used associated with pa consulting postcompletion compensation payments made during the year these payments were offset in part by overall improved working capital performance driven by favorability in accounts receivable collection trends partly offset by payments of certain costs deferred from the 2020 covid assistance programs in the us and europe 

page 61 

our cash used for investing activities for fiscal 2021 of 138 billion was comparatively higher than the 4291 million cash used for investing activities for the prior year the increase was due primarily to the buffalo group acquisition and our investment in pa consulting during fiscal 2021 partially offset by proceeds received from the companys disposal of the worley and c3 investments and the final ecr sale working capital settlement investing activities during the prior year were largely associated with the acquisition of john wood groups nuclear business of 2936 million 

our cash provided by financing activit ies for the fiscal year ended 2021 of 7990 million resulted mainly from net proceeds from borrowings of 122 billion mainly in connection with the pa consulting investment offset by cash used for share repurchases of 2749 million and 1560 million in dividends to shareholders and noncontrolling interests cash used for financing activities was 2083 million in fiscal 2020 and resulted mainly from common stock repurchases of 3373 million and dividend payments to both shareholders and noncontrolling interests of 1440 million offset by net proceeds from borrowings of 2653 million 

at october 1 2021 the company had approximately 1404 million in cash and cash equivalents held in the us and 8739 million held outside of the us primarily in the uk the eurozone australia india japan and the united arab emirates which is used primarily for funding operations in those regions other than the tax cost of repatriating funds to the us see note 7 income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k there are no material impediments to repatriating these funds to the us 

on november 19 2021 jacobs consummated its previously announced acquisition of blacklynx blacklynx pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of agreement and plan of merger the “merger agreement” jacobs acquired all of blacklynxs outstanding shares of common stock in a transaction valued at up to 2575 million on a cashfree debtfree basis including base consideration of 250 million and a potential earnout payment of up to 75 million the amount of any earnout payment will depend on blacklynx achieving certain revenue and gross margin thresholds in calendar year 2022 the purchase price was paid in cash and is subject to customary postclosing adjustments 

on march 2 2021 jacobs completed the strategic investment of a 65 interest in pa consulting a ukbased leading innovation and transformation consulting firm the total consideration paid by the company was17 billion funded through cash on hand a new term loan and draws on the companys existing revolver the remaining 35 interest is held by pa consulting employees see note 14 pa consulting business combination for more discussion on the investment and note 9 borrowings for more discussion on the financing for the transaction 

on january 20 2021 the company entered into an unsecured delayed draw term loan facility the “2021 term loan facility” with a syndicate of financial institutions as lenders under the 2021 term loan facility the company borrowed an aggregate principal amount of 2000 million and £6500 million the proceeds of the term loans were used primarily to fund the investment in pa consulting the 2021 term loan facility contains affirmative and negative covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type that are consistent with those included in the revolving credit facility and the company’s unsecured term loan facility dated march 25 2020 the “2020 term loan facility” the 2020 term loan facility and the 2021 term loan facility are together referred to as the term loan facilities 

on november 24 2020 a subsidiary of jacobs completed the acquisition of buffalo group a leader in advanced cyber and intelligence solutions which allows jacobs to further expand its cyber and intelligence solutions offerings to government clients the company paid total consideration o f 1901 million which was comprised of approximately 1824 million in cash to the former owners of buffalo group and contingent consideration of 77 million which was expected to be settled in fiscal 2022 see note 15 other business combinations for further discussion  

the company had 2638 million in letters of credit outstanding at october 1 2021 of this amount 17 million was issued under the revolving credit facility and 2621 million wa s issued under separate committed and uncommitted letterofcredit facilities 

we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our projected cash requirements for the next twelve months based on the liquidity provided by our cash and cash equivalents on hand our borrowing capacity and our continuing cash from operations we further believe that our financial resources and discretionary spend controls will allow us to continue managing the negative impacts of th e covid19 pandemic on our business operations for the foreseeable future we will continue to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on our business and reassess accordingly 

we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants at october 1 2021

please see the note 9 borrowings in notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k which is incorporated herein by reference for a discussion of the revolving credit facility term loan facilities and note purchase agreement 

our revolving credit facility term loan facilities and certain other debt obligations are subject to variable rate interest which could be adversely affected by an increase in interest rates as of october 1 2021 we had an aggregate of 24 billion in outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan facilities interest on amounts borrowed under these agreements is subject to adjustment based on the c ompany’s consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreements governing the revolving credit facility and the term loan facilities depending on the company’s consolidated leverage ratio borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the term loan facilities bear interest at a eurocurrency rate plus a margin of between 0875 and 1625 or a base rate plus a margin of between 0 and 0625 additionally if our consolidated leverage ratio exceeds a certain amount the interest on the senior notes may increase by 75 basis points however as discussed in note 18 commitments and contingencies and derivative financial instrument s we have entered into swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of 9239 million t o convert the variab le rate interest based liabilities associated with a corresponding amount of our debt into fixed interest rate liabilities leaving 15 billion in principal amount subject to variable interest rate risk 

for the year ended october 1 2021 our weighted average floating rate borrowings that are subject to floating rate exposure were approximately 14 billion  if floating interest rates had increased by 100 our interest expense for the year ended october 1 2021 would have increased by approximately 143 million

limitations on effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its system of internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed or operated can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of internal control are met the design of the company’s control system reflects the fact that there are resource constraints and that the benefits of such control systems must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control failures and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the intentional acts of individuals by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that the design of any particular control will always succeed in achieving its objective under all potential future conditions

impact of covid19 on our business 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization characterized the outbreak of the novel coronavirus “covid19” as a global pandemic and recommended certain containment and mitigation measures on march 13 2020 the united states declared a national emergency concerning the outbreak and the vast majority of states and many municipalities declared public health emergencies or took similar actions along with these declarations there were extraordinary and wideranging actions taken by international federal state and local public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat outbreaks of covid19 in regions across the united states and around the world these actions included quarantines and “stayathome” or “shelterinplace” orders social distancing measures travel restrictions school closures and similar mandates for many individuals in order to substantially restrict daily activities and orders for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations unless their work is critical essential or lifesustaining although certain jurisdictions have subsequently taken steps to lift or ease such restrictions to various degrees many jurisdictions have subsequently reversed or indicated they are considering reversing such lifting or easing in response to increased cases of covid19 in addition governments and central banks in the united states and other countries in which we operate have enacted fiscal and monetary stimulus and assistance measures to counteract the economic impacts of covid19 

as it became clear that the pandemic was unparalleled in the rate of community spread we took early decisive action to put people first help flatten the curve and take care of our clients and communities in early march we swiftly restricted travel and established return protocols for both clientrelated and personal travel in 10 days we successfully transitioned more than 85 of our employees to a remote working environment to support physical distancing where the essential and missioncritical nature of our work requires us to maintain staff at certain sites or locations we worked closely with our clients and established projectspecific plans designed to ensure the safety of our people and the integrity of our operation using technology and optimizing our networks we continue to offer flexible work scenarios for our people and to deliver business continuity for and continued collaboration with our clients our executive leadership team met daily for the first three months and weekly thereafter focusing on transparency agile response and business resiliency and our global and regional crisis management teams continued to maintain consistent messaging and direct local responses regular global town halls a weekly chair and ceo email and short selfproduced leadership videos share open transparent information to connect and unite our global community 

page 14 

we are a company operating in a critical infrastructure industry as defined by the us department of homeland security consistent with international federal state and local requirements to date we continue to materially operate in addition demand for certain of our services including those supporting health care relief efforts relating to covid19 has increased and could continue to increase as a result of covid19 notwithstanding our continued critical operations covid19 has negatively impacted our business and may have further adverse impacts on our continued operations including those listed and discussed in item 1a risk factors included in this annual report on form 10k accordingly we have reduced spending broadly across the company only proceeding with operating and capital spending that is critical we have also ceased all nonessential hiring and reduced discretionary expenses including certain employee benefits and compensation looking ahead we have developed contingency plans to reduce costs further if the situation further deteriorates or lasts longer than current expectations we will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be necessary or appropriate for the health and safety of employees contractors customers suppliers or others or as required by international federal state or local authorities 

based on current estimates we expect the impact of covid19 to continue in the first half of fiscal 2021 although to a lesser degree than what was seen in fiscal 2020 although this business disruption is expected to be temporary significant uncertainty exists concerning the magnitude duration and impacts of the covid19 pandemic including with regard to the effects on our customers and customer demand for our services accordingly actual results for future fiscal periods could differ materially versus current expectations and current results and financial condition discussed herein may not be indicative of future operating results and trends

energy chemicals and resources ecr 

ecr disposition 

on april 26 2019 jacobs completed the sale of its energy chemicals and resources ecr business to worley limited a company incorporated in australia worley for a purchase price of 34 billion consisting of i 28 billion in cash plus ii 582 million ordinary shares of worley subject to adjustments for changes in working capital and certain other items the ecr sale 

as a result of the ecr sale substantially all ecrrelated assets and liabilities were sold the disposal group we determined that the disposal group should be reported as discontinued operations in accordance with asc 21005 discontinued operations because their disposal represents a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results as such the financial results of the ecr business are reflected in our consolidated statements of earnings as discontinued operations for all periods presented additionally assets and liabilities of the ecr business were reflected as heldforsale in the consolidated balance sheets through september 27 2019 as of the year ended october 2 2020 all of the ecr business to be sold under the terms of the sale has been conveyed to worley and as such no amounts remain held for sale for further discussion see note 15 sale of energy chemicals and resources ecr business to the consolidated financial statements 

prior to the sale the ecr business served the energy chemicals and resources sectors including upstream midstream and downstream oil gas refining chemicals and mining and minerals industries the ecr business provided integrated delivery of complex projects for our oil and gas refining and petrochemicals clients bridging the upstream midstream and downstream industries ecrs services encompassed consulting engineering procurement construction maintenance and project management 

significant customers 

the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government for each of the last three fiscal years 



given the percentage of total revenue derived directly from the us federal government the loss of us federal government agencies as customers would have a material adverse effect on the company in addition any or all of our government contracts could be terminated we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work or payment of our costs could be disallowed approximately 80 of revenue derived directly from the us federal government is in the cms segment for more information on risks relating to our government contracts see item 1a  risk factors 

contracts 

while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake our contracts generally fall into two broad categories costreimbursable and fixedprice the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the last three fiscal years 



in accordance with industry practice most of our contracts including those with the us federal government are subject to termination at the discretion of the client which is discussed in greater detail in item 1a  risk factors  in such situations our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination 

page 22 

costreimbursable contracts 

costreimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit the profit element may be in the form of a simple markup applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee or a combination of a markup and a fee the fee element can also take several forms the fee may be a fixed amount it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred or it may be an incentive fee based on targets milestones or performance factors defined in the contract 

fixedprice contracts 

fixedprice contracts include both “lump sum bid” contracts and “negotiated fixedprice” contracts under lump sum bid contracts we typically bid against competitors based on clientfurnished specifications this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period additionally it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients which is contrary to our relationshipbased business model accordingly lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract in contrast under a negotiated fixedprice contract we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client negotiated fixedprice contracts frequently exist in singleresponsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project thus although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us in our services contracts as well as construction however because of economies that may be realized during the contract term both negotiated fixedprice and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts the company carefully manages the risk inherent in these types of contracts in recent years most of our fixedprice work has been either negotiated fixedprice contracts or lump sum bid contracts for design andor project services rather than turnkey construction 

competition 

we compete with a large number of companies across the world including technology consulting federal it services aerospace defense and engineering firms typically no single company or companies dominate the markets in which we provide services and in many cases we partner with our competitors or other companies to jointly pursue projects aecom booz allen caci kbr leidos parsons saic tetra tech wsp general dynamics and northrop grumman are some of our competitors we compete based on the following factors among others technical capabilities reputation for quality price of services safety record availability of qualified personnel and ability to timely perform work and contract terms

while our beyondzero journey started with safety as we continued to drive our injury rates down we also expanded our thinking to our broader culture of caring and particularly mental health it was this strong foundation that helped us act swiftly at the start of the covid19 pandemic the foundation elements of our existing “mental health matters” program enabled us to respond quickly to launch our “mental health matters resiliency” program and to promote our suicide awareness campaign in fiscal 2020 

in fiscal 2020 almost 2000 positive mental health champions an 11 increase from fiscal 2019 trained to support the mental wellbeing of our employees and one in every 29 employees trained as a positive mental health champion in addition 100 of jacobs’ executive leadership team participated in positive mental health training

page 28 

• we may be required to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and postretirement benefit plans we manage 

• demand for our services is cyclical as the sectors and industries in which our clients operate are impacted by economic downturns reductions in government or private spending and times of political uncertainty 

• rising inflation interest rates andor construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts in particular with respect to our fixedprice contracts 

• our global presence could give rise to material fluctuations in our income tax rates

risks related to our operations 

the covid19 pandemic including the measures that international federal state and local public health and other governmental authorities implement to address it have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization characterized the outbreak of the novel coronavirus “covid19” as a global pandemic and recommended certain containment and mitigation measures on march 13 2020 the united states declared a national emergency concerning the outbreak and the vast majority of states and many municipalities declared public health emergencies or taken similar actions since then there have been extraordinary and wideranging actions taken by international federal state and local public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak of covid19 in regions across the united states and around the world these actions include quarantines and “stayathome” or “shelterinplace” orders social distancing measures travel restrictions school closures and similar mandates for many individuals in order to substantially restrict daily activities and orders for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations unless their work is critical essential or life 

page 29 

sustaining although certain jurisdictions have taken steps to lift or ease such restrictions to various degrees some jurisdictions have subsequently reversed such lifting or easing in response to increased cases of covid19 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect certain elements of our business including but not limited to the following 

• we have experienced and may continue to experience reductions in demand for certain of our services and the delay or abandonment of ongoing or anticipated projects due to our clients’ suppliers’ and other third parties’ diminished financial conditions or financial distress as well as governmental budget constraints these impacts are expected to continue or worsen if “stayathome” “shelterinplace” social distancing travel restrictions and other similar orders measures or restrictions remain in place for an extended period of time or are reimposed after being lifted or eased although we have experienced and may continue to experience an increase in demand for certain of our services as a result of new projects that have arisen in response to the covid19 pandemic there can be no assurance that any such increased demand would be sufficient to offset lost or delayed demand 

• governmentsponsored stimulus or assistance programs enacted todate in the united states and in the foreign countries in which we operate in response to the covid19 pandemic have only been available to us or our customers or suppliers on a limited basis and are insufficient to address the full impact of the covid19 pandemic for example the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the “cares act” contains provisions that authorize federal agencies to pay contractors to retain key workers where regular work schedules are not possible due to quarantines or other social isolation measures we have pursued payment for these alternative work arrangements with applicable federal agencies or contracting officials and will continue to assess the availability of such subsidies on a contractbycontract basis certain foreign governments are also permitting contracting authorities to revise the terms of government contracts andor providing various forms of subsidies to compensate companies who maintain their workforce rather than impose layoffs or furloughs certain other governments have provided partial expense reimbursement for furloughed employees and also provided for the deferral of payroll taxes although we expect to recover a significant portion of covid19 related labor costs we do not expect to recover the full amount of either our labor cost or associated fee additionally these and other governmentsponsored assistance and stimulus programs are subject to renewal modification or termination by the applicable governing bodies if any governmentsponsored program from which we receive benefits is modified or terminated our benefits thereunder could decline or cease altogether which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

• our clients may be unable to meet their payment obligations to us in a timely manner including as a result of deteriorating financial condition or bankruptcy resulting from the covid19 pandemic and resulting economic impacts further other third parties such as suppliers subcontractors joint venture partners and other outside business partners may experience significant disruptions in their ability to satisfy their obligations with respect to us or they may be unable to do so altogether 

• many employers including us and governments continue to require all or a significant portion of employees to work from home or not go into their offices while many of our employees can effectively perform their responsibilities while working remotely some work is not wellsuited for remote work and that work may not be completed as efficiently as if it were performed on site additionally we may be exposed to unexpected cybersecurity risks and additional information technologyrelated expenses as a result of these remote working requirements 

• illness travel restrictions or other workforce disruptions could adversely affect our supply chain our ability to timely and satisfactorily complete our clients’ projects our ability to provide services to our clients or our other business processes even after the covid19 pandemic subsides we could experience a longerterm impact on our operating expenses including for example due to the need for enhanced health and hygiene requirements or the periodic revival of social distancing or other measures in one or more regions in attempts to counteract future outbreaks 

• we have furloughed certain employees and may need to further furlough or reduce the number of employees that we employ we may experience difficulties associated with hiring additional employees or replacing employees in particular with respect to roles that require security clearances or other special qualifications that may be limited or difficult to obtain increased turnover rates of our employees could increase operating costs and create challenges for us in maintaining high levels of employee awareness of 

page 30 

and compliance with our internal procedures and external regulatory compliance requirements in addition to increasing our recruiting training and supervisory costs 

• in addition to existing travel restrictions implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic jurisdictions may continue to close borders impose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel and business activity which could materially impair our ability to support our operations and clients both domestic and international to source supplies through the global supply chain and to identify pursue and capture new business opportunities and which could continue to restrict the ability of our employees to access their workplaces we also face the possibility of increased overhead or other expenses resulting from compliance with any future government orders or other measures enacted in response to the covid19 pandemic 

• the covid19 pandemic has increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets and that increased volatility is likely to continue while we entered into a new 1 billion term loan facility in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 we might not be able to access further sources of liquidity on acceptable pricing or borrowing terms if at all our credit facilities contain customary covenants restricting among other things our ability to incur certain liens and indebtedness we are also subject to certain financial covenants including maintenance of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio a breach of any covenant or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios whether as a result of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business or otherwise could result in a default under one or more of our credit facilities and limit our ability to do further borrowing any inability to obtain additional liquidity as and when needed or to maintain compliance with the instruments governing our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

• we operate in many countries around the world and certain of those countries’ governments may be unable to effectively mitigate the financial or other impacts of the covid19 pandemic on their economies and workforces and our operations therein 

the continued global spread of the covid19 pandemic and the responses thereto are complex and rapidly evolving and the extent to which the pandemic impacts our business financial condition and results of operations including the duration and magnitude of such impacts will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess covid19 and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic as well as reactions to future pandemics or resurgences of covid19 could also precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors that we identify in in this annual report on form 10k which in turn could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations there may be other adverse consequences to our business financial condition and results of operations from the spread of covid19 that we have not considered or have not become apparent as a result we cannot assure you that if covid19 continues to spread it would not have a further adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

project sites are inherently dangerous workplaces if we the owner or others working at the project site fail to maintain safe work sites and our employees or others become injured disabled or even lose their lives we can be exposed to significant financial losses and reputational harm as well as civil and criminal liabilities 

project sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment moving vehicles chemical and manufacturing processes and highly regulated materials in a challenging environment and often in geographically remote locations if we or others working at such sites fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective or if others working at the site fail to implement and follow appropriate safety procedures our employees and others may become injured disabled or even lose their lives the completion or commencement of our projects may be delayed and we may be exposed to litigation or investigations unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover increase the cost of a project to our clients and raise our operating and insurance costs any of the foregoing could result in financial losses or reputational harm which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials which if improperly handled or disposed of could subject us to civil andor criminal liabilities we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health safety and environmental “hse” work procedures throughout our organization including project sites and maintenance sites the failure to comply with such regulations could subject 

page 31 

us to liability in addition despite the work of our functional groups we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel or that there will be no damage to or loss of our work equipment or supplies 

our safety record is critical to our reputation many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures accordingly if we fail to maintain adequate safety standards we could suffer reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the performance of these contracts 

our revenues are derived from new contract awards delays in the timing of the awards or cancellations of such projects as a result of economic conditions material and equipment pricing and availability or other factors could impact our longterm projected results it is particularly difficult to predict whether or when we will receive largescale projects as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process which is affected by a number of factors such as market conditions or governmental and environmental approvals since a significant portion of our revenues is generated from such projects our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards and the commencement or progress of work under awarded contracts furthermore many of these contracts are subject to financing contingencies and as a result we are subject to the risk that the customer will not be able to secure the necessary financing for the project 

in addition many of our contracts require us to satisfy specific progress or performance milestones in order to receive payment from the customer as a result we may incur significant costs for engineering materials components equipment labor or subcontractors prior to receipt of payment from a customer 

the uncertainty of our contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs in some cases we maintain and bear the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than necessary under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards if an expected contract award is delayed or not received we may incur additional costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we engage in a highly competitive business if we are unable to compete effectively we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

we face intense competition to provide technical professional and construction management services to clients the markets we serve are highly competitive and we compete against a large number of regional national and multinational companies the extent and type of our competition varies by industry geographic area and project type 

our projects are frequently awarded through a competitive bidding process which is standard in our industry we are constantly competing for project awards based on pricing schedule and the breadth and technical sophistication of our services competition can place downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins which may force us to accept contractual terms and conditions that are less favorable to us thereby increasing the risk that among other things we may not realize profit margins at the same rates as we have seen in the past or may become responsible for costs or other liabilities we have not accepted in the past if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both which if significant could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the nature of our contracts particularly those that are fixedprice subjects us to risks of cost overruns we may experience reduced profits or in some cases losses if costs increase above budgets or estimates or if the project experiences schedule delays 

for fiscal 2020 approximately 24 of our revenues were earned under fixedprice contracts both fixedprice and many cost reimbursable contracts require us to estimate the total cost of the project in advance of our performance for fixedprice contracts we may benefit from any costsavings but we bear greater risk of paying some if not all of any cost overruns fixedprice contracts are established in part on partial or incomplete designs cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions including those about future economic conditions commodity and other materials pricing and availability of labor equipment and materials and other exigencies if the 

page 32 

design or the estimates prove inaccurate or if circumstances change due to among other things unanticipated technical problems difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals changes in local laws or labor conditions weather or other delays beyond our control changes in the costs of equipment or raw materials our vendors’ or subcontractors’ inability or failure to perform or changes in general economic conditions then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or in some cases a loss for that project these risks are exacerbated for projects with longterm durations because there is an increased risk that the circumstances on which we based our original estimates will change in a manner that increases costs if the project is significant or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our contracts that are fundamentally cost reimbursable in nature may also present a risk to the extent the final cost on a project exceeds the amount the customer expected or budgeted like fixedprice contracts the expected cost of costreimbursable projects are based in part on partial design and our estimates of the resources and time necessary to perform such contracts a portion of the fee is often linked to these estimates and the related final cost and schedule objectives and if for whatever reason these objectives are not met the project may be less profitable than we expect or even result in losses 

the loss of or a significant reduction in business from one or a few customers could have a material adverse impact on us 

a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue andor backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years for example in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 approximately 33 27 and 32 respectively of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government although we have longstanding relationships with many of our significant clients our clients may unilaterally reduce delay or cancel their contracts at any time our loss of or a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted canceled or suspended by our clients and therefore our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings additionally even if fully performed our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins 

backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us as of the end of fiscal 2020 our backlog totaled approximately 238 billion there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or if realized will result in profits in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation termination or suspension at the discretion of the client including our us government work in the event of a project cancellation we would generally have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project the risk of contracts in backlog being canceled or suspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns or in response to changes in commodity prices 

the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts the revenue for certain contracts included in backlog is based on estimates additionally the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence future profitability 

in some markets there is a continuing trend towards costreimbursable contracts with incentivefee arrangements typically our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs overall safety performance overall client satisfaction and other performance criteria if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards we may receive a lower or even zero incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins accordingly there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog assuming they produce the revenues currently expected will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies which are a significant source of our revenue and profit are subject to various uncertainties restrictions and regulations including oversight 

page 33 

audits by various government authorities as well as profit and cost controls which could result in withholding or delay of payments to us government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding such as sequestration and budget deficits contracts with the us federal government for example are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding us government shutdowns or any related understaffing of the government departments or agencies that interact with our business could result in program cancellations disruptions andor stop work orders could limit the government’s ability to effectively progress programs and make timely payments and could limit our ability to perform on our existing us government contracts and successfully compete for new work governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for government programs may even be eliminated legislatures typically appropriate funds on a yearbyyear basis while contract performance may take more than one year as a result contracts with government agencies may be only partially funded or may be terminated and we may not realize all of the potential revenue and profit from those contracts 

our government clients may reduce the scope of or terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues for example those with the us federal government represented approximately 33 of our total revenue in fiscal 2020 a significant reduction in government funding or the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

most government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process the us federal government has increasingly relied upon multipleyear contracts with multiple contractors that generally require those contractors to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under a contract this process may result in us facing significant additional pricing pressure and uncertainty and incurring additional costs moreover we may not be awarded government contracts because of existing policies designed to protect small businesses and underrepresented minorities our inability to win new contracts or be awarded work under existing contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socioeconomic requirements which affect how we transact business with our clients and in some instances impose additional costs on our business operations for example for contracts with the us federal government we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation the truth in negotiations act the cost accounting standards and numerous regulations governing environmental protection and employment practices government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than nongovernment contracts this includes for example unlimited indemnification obligations 

we also are subject to government audits investigations and proceedings for example government agencies such as the us defense contract audit agency routinely review and audit us to determine the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies and whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations these audits can result in a determination that a rule or regulation has been violated or that adjustments are necessary to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies 

if we violate a rule or regulation fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit a variety of penalties can be imposed on us including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties for example in socalled “qui tam” actions brought by individuals or the government under the us federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws treble damages can be awarded in addition any or all of our government contracts could be terminated we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work or payment of our costs could be disallowed the occurrence of any of these actions could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances which can be difficult and time consuming to obtain if our employees or our facilities are unable to obtain or retain the necessary security clearances our clients could terminate or not renew existing contracts or award us new contracts which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

our project execution activities may result in liability for faulty services 

if we fail to provide our services in accordance with applicable professional standards or contractual requirements we could be exposed to significant monetary damages or even criminal violations our engineering practice for example involves professional judgments regarding the planning design development construction 

page 34 

operations and management of industrial facilities and public infrastructure projects while we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages in our contracts and although we have adopted a range of insurance risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities a catastrophic event at one of our project sites or completed projects resulting from the services we have performed could result in significant professional or product liability and warranty or other claims against us as well as reputational harm especially if public safety is impacted these liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or the fees we generate may not be covered by insurance at all due to various exclusions in our coverage and could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future further even where coverage applies the policies have deductibles which result in our assumption of exposure for certain amounts with respect to any claim filed against us in addition clients or subcontractors who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us an uninsured claim either in part or in whole as well as any claim covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible if successful and of a material magnitude could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are a party to claims and litigation in the normal course of business including litigation inherited through acquisitions since we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities and projects where design construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or others we are exposed to substantial claims and litigation and investigations if there is a failure at any such facility or project such claims could relate to among other things personal injury loss of life business interruption property damage pollution and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties such as those who use or reside near our clients’ projects we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met in many of our contracts with clients subcontractors and vendors we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages penalties losses and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts in addition while clients and subcontractors may agree to indemnify us against certain liabilities such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us 

with a workforce of approximately 55000 people globally we are also party to labor and employment claims in the normal course of business such claims could relate to allegations of harassment and discrimination pay equity denial of benefits wage and hour violations whistleblower protections concerted protected activity and other employment protections and may be pursued on an individual or class action basis depending on applicable laws and regulations some of such claims may be insurable while other such claims may not 

we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations our insurance programs have varying coverage limits as well as exclusions for matters such as fraud and insurance companies may attempt to deny claims for which we seek coverage in addition we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles retentions and limits under these programs as a result we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured 

although in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future or that such insurance can be economically secured for example catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits coverage that is more limited or increased premium costs or higher deductibles we monitor the financial health of the insurance companies from which we procure insurance which is one of the factors we take into account when purchasing insurance our insurance is purchased from a number of the worlds leading providers often in layered insurance or quota share arrangements if any of our third party insurers fail abruptly cancel our coverage or otherwise cannot satisfy their insurance requirements to us then our overall risk exposure and operational expenses could be increased and our business operations could be interrupted 

in addition the nature of our business sometimes results in clients subcontractors and vendors presenting claims to us for among other things recovery of costs related to certain projects similarly we occasionally present change orders and claims to our clients subcontractors and vendors for among other things additional costs exceeding the original contract price if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients subcontractors and vendors we could incur cost overruns reduced profits or in some cases a loss for a project further these claims can be the subject of lengthy negotiations arbitration or litigation proceedings which could result in the investment of significant amounts 

page 35 

of working capital pending the resolution of the relevant change orders and claims a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results additionally irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant 

litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability product liability criminal liability warranty obligations default under our credit agreements and other liabilities which to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control 

as is common in our industry we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures partnerships and similar arrangements this situation exposes us to a number of risks including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients 

further we have limited ability to control the actions of our joint venture partners including with respect to nonperformance default bankruptcy or legal or regulatory compliance our partners may be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships if these circumstances occur we may be liable for claims and losses attributable to the partner by operation of law or contract these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend on the management effectiveness of our joint venture partners differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major issues which could materially affect the business and operations of these ventures in addition in many of the countries in which we engage in joint ventures it may be difficult to enforce our contractual rights under the applicable joint venture agreement if we are not able to enforce our contractual rights we may not be able to realize the benefits of the joint venture or we may be subject to additional liabilities 

we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner in these cases we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the failure by a joint venture partner to comply with applicable laws regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and for government clients could result in fines penalties suspension or even debarment being imposed on us which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts 

thirdparty subcontractors we hire perform a significant amount of the work performed under our contracts we also rely on thirdparty equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired if we are not able to locate qualified thirdparty subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated especially in a lump sum or a fixedprice contract we may suffer losses on these contracts if a subcontractor supplier or manufacturer fails to provide services supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason we may be required to source these services equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms which could impact contract profitability there is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors relating to among other things the quality and timeliness of work performed customer concerns about the subcontractor or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a contract in addition faulty workmanship equipment or materials could impact the overall project resulting in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications 

page 36 

in an uncertain or downturn economic environment third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party’s ability to provide materials equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a failure by a third party subcontractor supplier or manufacturer to comply with applicable laws regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and for government clients could result in fines penalties suspension or even debarment being imposed on us which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

employee agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts which could result in reduced revenues and profits 

misconduct fraud noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or other improper activities by one of our employees agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations regulations regarding the protection of classified information regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts regulations on lobbying or similar activities regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting regulations pertaining to export control environmental laws employee wages pay and benefits and any other applicable laws or regulations for example we routinely provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters if a security breach were to occur our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective and we could face unknown risks or losses our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties cancellation of contracts loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our international operations are exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies 

for fiscal 2020 approximately 25 o f our revenue was earned from clients outside the us our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues our international operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

• recessions and other economic crises in other regions such as europe or specific foreign economies and the impact on our costs of doing business in those countries 

• difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations including logistical and communication challenges 

• unexpected changes in foreign government policies and regulatory requirements 

• potential noncompliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations including anticorruption export control and antiboycott laws and similar nonus laws and regulations 

• potential noncompliance with regulations and evolving industry standards regarding consumer protection and data use and security including the general data protection regulation approved by the european union 

• lack of developed legal systems to enforce contractual rights 

• expropriation and nationalization of our assets in a foreign country 

• renegotiation or nullification of our existing contracts 

• the adoption of new and the expansion of existing trade or other restrictions 

• embargoes duties tariffs or other trade restrictions including sanctions 

• changes in labor conditions 

• acts of war civil unrest force majeure and terrorism 

• the ability to finance efficiently our foreign operations 

• social political and economic instability 

page 37 

• changes to tax policy 

• currency exchange rate fluctuations 

• limitations on the ability to repatriate foreign earnings and 

• us government policy changes in relation to the foreign countries in which we operate 

the lack of a welldeveloped legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights in addition military action geopolitical shifts or continued unrest particularly in the middle east could impact the supply or pricing of oil disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere and increase our security costs to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic political and other conditions our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we work in international locations where there are high security risks which could result in harm to our employees or unanticipated cost 

some of our services are performed in highrisk locations where the country or location is subject to political social or economic risks or war terrorism or civil unrest in those locations where we have employees or operations we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel despite these activities in these locations we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel and we may suffer future losses of employees and subcontractors acts of terrorism and threats of armed conflicts in or around various areas in which we operate could limit or disrupt markets and our operations including disruptions resulting from the evacuation of personnel cancellation of contracts or the loss of key employees contractors or assets 

cyber security or privacy breaches or systems and information technology interruption or failure could adversely impact our ability to operate or expose us to significant financial losses and reputational harm 

we rely heavily on computer information and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business from time to time we experience occasional system interruptions and delays in the event we are unable to regularly deploy software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems the operation of such systems could be interrupted or result in the loss corruption or release of data in addition our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters force majeure events telecommunications failures power loss acts of war or terrorism computer viruses malicious code physical or electronic security breaches intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error or similar events or disruptions any of these or other events could cause interruptions delays loss of critical andor sensitive data or similar effects which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition protection of intellectual property and results of operations as well as those of our clients 

in addition we face the threat to our computer systems of unauthorized access computer hackers computer viruses malicious code ransomware phishing organized cyberattacks and other security problems and system disruptions including possible unauthorized access to and disclosure of our and our clients’ proprietary or classified information in addition such tactics may also seek to cause payments due to or from the company to be misdirected to fraudulent accounts which may not be recoverable by the company 

while we have security measures and technology in place to protect our and our clients’ proprietary or classified information if these measures fail as a result of a cyberattack other thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and someone obtains unauthorized access to our or our clients’ information our reputation could be damaged our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures as a result we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of system disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these disruptions and breaches any of these events could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition new laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information including the european union general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy 

page 38 

act pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate costs and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties and legal liability 

we continuously evaluate the need to upgrade andor replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our computing environment to stay current on vendor supported products and to improve the efficiency of our systems and for other business reasons the implementation of new systems and information technology could adversely impact our operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems in addition our systems implementations may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated systems implementation disruption and any other information technology disruption if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have an adverse effect on our business 

we are subject to professional standards duties and statutory obligations on professional reports and opinions we issue which could subject us to monetary damages 

we issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional engineering expertise as well as our other professional credentials that subject us to professional standards duties and obligations regulating the performance of our services for example we issue opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings if a client or another third party alleges that our report or opinion is incorrect or it is improperly relied upon and we are held responsible we could be subject to significant monetary damages in addition our reports and other work product may need to comply with professional standards licensing requirements securities regulations and other laws and rules governing the performance of professional services in the jurisdiction where the services are performed we could be liable to third parties who use or rely upon our reports and other work product even if we are not contractually bound to those third parties these events could in turn result in monetary damages and penalties 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or that of our clients 

our technology and intellectual property provide us in certain instances with a competitive advantage although we protect our property through registration licensing contractual arrangements security controls and similar mechanisms we may not be able to successfully preserve our rights and they could be invalidated circumvented challenged or become obsolete trade secrets are generally difficult to protect our employees and contractors are subject to confidentiality obligations but this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information andor infringement of our intellectual property in addition the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the us if we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights even if ultimately successful could be costly and could divert leadership’s attention away from other aspects of our business 

we also hold licenses from third parties which may be utilized in our business operations if we are no longer able to license such technology on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise our business and financial performance could be adversely affected 

if our intellectual property rights or work processes become obsolete we may not be able to differentiate our service offerings and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers our competitors may independently attempt to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies 

our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property there is a risk we may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and as a result could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities loss of contracts or other consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we do not have adequate indemnification for our nuclear services it could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the priceanderson nuclear industries indemnity act commonly called the priceanderson act “paa” is a us federal law which among other things regulates radioactive materials and the nuclear energy industry including liability and compensation in the event of nuclear related incidents the paa provides certain protections and indemnification to nuclear energy plant operators and us department of energy “doe” contractors the paa 

page 39 

protections and indemnification apply to us as part of our services to the us nuclear energy industry and doe for new facilities maintenance modification decontamination and decommissioning of nuclear energy weapons and research facilities 

we offer similar services in other jurisdictions outside the us for those jurisdictions varying levels of nuclear liability protection is provided by international treaties andor domestic laws such as the nuclear liability and compensation act of canada and the nuclear installations act of the united kingdom insurance andor assets of the nuclear installation operators some of which are backed by governments as well as under appropriate enforceable contractual indemnifications and holdharmless provisions these protections and indemnifications however may not cover all of our liability that could arise in the performance of these services to the extent the paa or other protections and indemnifications do not apply to our services the cost of losses associated with liability not covered by the available protections and indemnifications or by virtue of our loss of business because of these added costs could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements 

in preparing our financial statements our leadership is required under us gaap to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities areas requiring significant estimates by our leadership include 

• recognition of contract revenue costs profit or losses in applying the principles of percentage of completion accounting 

• estimated amounts for expected project losses warranty costs contract closeout or other costs 

• recognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims 

• collectability of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the need and amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts 

• estimates of other liabilities including litigation and insurance revenuesreserves and reserves necessary for selfinsured risks 

• accruals for estimated liabilities including litigation reserves 

• valuation of assets acquired and liabilities goodwill and intangible assets assumed in acquisitions and ongoing assessment of impairment 

• valuation of stockbased compensation 

• the determination of liabilities under pension and other postretirement benefit programs 

• income tax provisions and related valuation allowances and 

• valuation of investment in worley stock 

our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

page 40 

an impairment charge on our goodwill or intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

because we have grown in part through acquisitions goodwill and intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets under us gaap we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach we also assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our intangible assets when indications of impairment are present based on expected future probability and undiscounted expected cash flows and their contribution to our overall operations as of october 2 2020 we had 564 billion of goodwill representing 456 of our total assets of 1235 billion we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the beginning of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business potential government actions toward our facilities and other factors 

if our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value we could be required to record an impairment charge the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing please see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 

impairment of longlived assets or restructuring activities may require us to record a significant charge to earnings 

our longlived assets including our lease rightofuse assets equity investments and other are subject to periodic testing for impairment failure to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow at the asset group level could result in impairment of our longlived assets further changes in the business environment could lead to changes in the scope of operations of our business these changes including the closure of one or more offices could result in restructuring andor asset impairment charges the covid19 pandemic raises the possibility of an extended global economic downturn which increase the risk of longlived asset impairment charges 

we may be required to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and postretirement benefit plans we manage 

we have various employee benefit plan obligations that require us to make contributions to satisfy over time our underfunded benefit obligations which are generally determined by calculating the projected benefit obligations minus the fair value of plan assets for example as of october 2 2020 and september 27 2019 our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by 4004 million and 3998 million respectively see note 13 pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k for additional disclosure in the future our benefit plan obligations may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of interest rates pension plan asset performance and other factors if we are required to contribute a significant amount of the deficit for underfunded benefit plans our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

page 41 

negotiations with labor unions and possible work actions could disrupt operations and increase labor costs and operating expenses 

a certain portion of our work force has entered or may in the future enter into collective bargaining agreements which on occasion may require renegotiation the outcome of future negotiations relating to union representation or collective bargaining agreements may not be favorable to the company in that they may increase our operating expenses and lower our net income as a result of higher wages or benefit expenses in addition negotiations with unions could divert management attention and disrupt operations which may adversely affect our results of operations if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements we may have to address the threat of unioninitiated work actions including strikes depending on the nature of the threat or the type and duration of any work action these actions could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

demand for our services is cyclical as the sectors and industries in which our clients operate are impacted by economic downturns reductions in government or private spending and times of political uncertainty 

we provide full spectrum technical and professional solutions to clients operating in a number of sectors and industries including programs for various national governments including the us federal government aerospace automotive pharmaceuticals and biotechnology infrastructure environmental and nuclear buildings smart cities power water transportation telecom and other general industrial and consumer businesses and sectors these sectors and industries and the resulting demand for our services have been and we expect will continue to be cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control including economic conditions and changes in client spending particularly during periods of economic or political uncertainty 

uncertain global economic and political conditions may negatively impact our clients’ ability and willingness to fund their projects including their ability to raise capital and pay or timely pay our invoices they may also cause our clients to reduce their capital expenditures alter the mix of services purchased seek more favorable price and other contract terms and otherwise slow their spending on our services for example in the public sector declines in state and local tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending in addition under such conditions many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable these conditions may reduce the demand for our services which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally uncertain economic and political conditions may make it difficult for our clients our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities for example recent changes to us policies related to global trade and tariffs have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future of the global economy as well as retaliatory trade measures implemented by other countries the increasing cost of steel and aluminum may impact client spending we cannot predict the outcome of these changing trade policies or other unanticipated political conditions nor can we predict the timing strength or duration of any economic recovery or downturn worldwide or in our clients’ markets in addition our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and therefore may not recover as quickly as the economy at large weak economic conditions a failure to obtain expected benefits from any increased infrastructure spending or a reduction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore if a significant portion of our clients or projects are concentrated in a specific geographic area or industry our business may be disproportionately affected by negative trends or economic downturns in those specific geographic areas or industries 

regardless of economic or market conditions investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients’ markets and investment decisions as a result our past results have varied and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate

our operations may be impacted by the united kingdom’s exit from the european union 

in june 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” the uk formally exited the eu on january 30 2020 pursuant to a withdrawal agreement between the uk government and the eu the withdrawal agreement provides for a transition period from february through december 2020 to allow time for a future trade deal to be agreed upon as a result of the uk’s exit from the eu there may be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the uk and eu countries and increased regulatory complexities these changes may adversely affect our relationships with our existing and future customers suppliers employees and subcontractors or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the ongoing negotiations between the uk and the eu as to the terms upon which the uk will exit from the eu and the uncertainty as to their future trade agreement continues to create economic uncertainty which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs terminate or reduce the scope of existing contracts decrease or postpone currently planned contracts or negotiate for more favorable deal terms each of which may have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

rising inflation interest rates andor construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts in particular with respect to our fixedprice contracts 

rising inflation interest rates or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services in addition we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixedprice because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from costreimbursable type contracts approximately 76 during fiscal 2020  the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor however if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixedprice and lumpsum work is more prevalent inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future therefore increases in inflation interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects 

our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects both positive and negative that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar into the us dollar while we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in the currencies of our expenditures we do enter into contracts that expose us to currency risk particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs we attempt to minimize our exposure from currency risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies or entering into derivative hedging instruments when there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts these actions however may not always eliminate currency risk exposure the governments of certain countries have or may in the future impose restrictive exchange controls on local currencies and it may not be possible for us to engage in effective hedging transactions to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in a particular currency based on fluctuations in currency the us dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly we may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries 

page 43 

our global presence could give rise to material fluctuations in our income tax rates 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation the introduction of new tax accounting standards legislation regulations and related interpretations our global mix of earnings the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate or an ultimate determination that the company owes more taxes than the amounts previously accrued could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control 

extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control such as natural or manmade disasters could negatively impact our ability to operate as an example from time to time we face unexpected severe weather conditions which may result in weatherrelated delays that are not always reimbursable under a fixedprice contract evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services increased labor and material costs in areas resulting from weatherrelated damage and subsequent increased demand for labor and materials for repairing and rebuilding inability to deliver materials equipment and personnel to job sites in accordance with contract schedules and loss of productivity we may remain obligated to perform our services after any such natural or manmade event unless a force majeure clause or other contractual provision provides us with relief from our contractual obligations if we are not able to react quickly to such events or if a high concentration of our projects are in a specific geographic region that suffers from a natural or manmade catastrophe our operations may be significantly affected which could have a material adverse impact on our operations in addition if we cannot complete our contracts on time we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients which may reduce our profits 

climate change and related environmental issues could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in 2020 the world economic forum identified failure to act on climate change and related environmental issues as one of the top ten risks in terms of impact and likelihood for the first time in 2017 the taskforce on climaterelated financial disclosures tcfdwhich is an industryled group tasked within bringing climate related financial reporting into the mainstream estimated that the value of the global stock of manageable assets at risk from climate change between now and the year 2100 could be up to 43 trillion usd the risk framework put forward by the tcfd encourages organizations to consider climate risks and their materiality in four domains markettechnology reputation policylegal physical and across two climate scenarios “paris agreement” or low carbon scenario and “business as usual bau” or high carbon scenario as further described below each domain could pose a material risk to the company at a business andor project level and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

• market and technological shifts  we expect that climaterelated market and technological shifts will likely be driven by urban development population growth quality of life expectations of an emerging middle class in historically developing countries and developments in digital technologies this could create demand for low and zero carbon energy industrial processes and infrastructure resilience services for natural environments infrastructure and communities and the application of “smart” datadriven technologies 

• reputation our reputation is influenced by our delivery performance client engagement innovation price of our labor and projects regulatory compliance and risk management we anticipate particularly under our paris agreement 15°c scenario that our reputation with external and internal stakeholders could also be increasingly influenced by our values and practices regarding lowzero carbon transformation 

• policy and legal  policy and legal environments are expected to diverge sharply between our 4°c bau and 15°c paris agreement scenarios with the divergence mainly relating to greenhouse gas emissions and the extent to which lowzero carbon transitions are driven we expect that some national and subnational jurisdictions and some of our clients may advocate for the transition regardless of the extent to which there is global alignment with the paris agreement in contrast both scenarios are expected to converge on climate changerelated litigation and policy advocacy and regulatory support for climate resilience 

page 44 

• physical risks there could be significant physical risks from climate change under both our 4°c and 15°c scenarios these risks could be driven by increased temperature increased storm intensities sea level rise and changes in rainfall amount seasonality and the intensity of extreme events the types of change are similar under the two scenarios but their expressions could be much more severe under the 4°c scenario 

fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers’ investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation delays in existing work or changes in the timing and funding of new awards 

commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways for example for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil gas copper or fertilizers fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and therefore their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments furthermore declines in commodity prices can negatively impact our business in regions whose economies are substantially dependent on commodity prices such as the middle east to the extent commodity prices decline or fluctuate and our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects the demand for our services decreases which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned as well as those in progress and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel 

the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel including engineers architects designers craft personnel and corporate leadership professionals who have the required experience and expertise at a reasonable cost the market for these and other personnel is competitive from time to time it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients or to replace such personnel when needed in a timely manner in certain geographic areas for example we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel furthermore some of our personnel hold government granted clearance that may be required to obtain government projects if we were to lose some or all of these personnel they would be difficult to replace loss of the services of or failure to recruit qualified technical and leadership personnel could limit our ability to successfully complete existing projects and compete for new projects 

in addition in the event that any of our key personnel retire or otherwise leave the company we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans which requires devoting time and resources toward identifying and integrating new personnel into leadership roles and other key positions if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the cost of providing our services including the extent to which we utilize our workforce affects our profitability for example the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts if an expected contract award is delayed or not received we could incur costs resulting from excess staff reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties 

our business strategy involves growth through among other things the acquisition of other companies acquiring companies including ch2m hill companies ltd which we acquired in december 2017 keyw which we acquired in june 2019 and john wood group’s nuclear business which we acquired in march 2020 presents a number of risks including 

• assumption of liabilities of an acquired business including liabilities that were unknown at the time the acquisition was negotiated 

• failure of the acquired business to comply with us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations andor contractual requirements with government clients 

page 45 

• valuation methodologies may not accurately capture the value of the acquired business 

• failure to realize anticipated benefits such as cost savings synergies business opportunities and growth opportunities 

• the loss of key customers or suppliers including as a result of any actual or perceived conflicts of interest 

• difficulties or delays in obtaining regulatory approvals licenses and permits 

• difficulties relating to combining previously separate entities into a single integrated and efficient business 

• the effects of diverting leadership’s attention from daytoday operations to matters involving the integration of acquired companies 

• potentially substantial transaction costs associated with business combinations 

• potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition or postacquisition deterioration in an acquired business 

• difficulties relating to assimilating the leadership personnel benefits services and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities 

• difficulties retaining key personnel of an acquired business 

• increased burdens on our staff and on our administrative internal control and operating systems which may hinder our legal and regulatory compliance activities 

• difficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to an acquired business 

• increased financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning treasury management financial reporting and internal controls 

• the potential requirement for additional equity or debt financing which may not be available or if available may not have favorable terms and 

• the risks discussed in this item 1a risk factors that may relate to the activities of the acquired business prior to the acquisition 

while we may obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses andor insurance that could mitigate certain of these risks such rights may be difficult to enforce the losses may exceed any dedicated escrow funds and the indemnitors may not have the ability to financially support the indemnity or the insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover all losses 

if our leadership is unable to successfully integrate acquired companies or implement our growth strategy our operating results could be harmed in addition even if the operations of an acquisition are integrated successfully we may not realize the full benefits of an acquisition including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all moreover we cannot assure that we will continue to successfully expand or that growth or expansion will result in profitability 

in addition there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us existing cash balances and cash flow from operations together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities may be insufficient to make acquisitions future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing which may not be available on attractive terms or at all acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 

acquisitions and divestitures create various business risks and uncertainties during the pendency of the transaction 

consummation of any merger or divestiture is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions including one or more of the following i due diligence and its associated time and cost commitments ii board and shareholder approval iii regulatory approvals iv the absence of any legal restraint that would prevent the consummation of the transaction v the absence of material adverse conditions which can prevent the consummation of the transaction and vi compliance with covenants and the accuracy of representations and warranties contained in the transaction agreement among others one or more of these conditions may not be fulfilled and accordingly the transaction may not be consummated or may be significantly delayed in such case our ongoing business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the market price of our common stock 

page 46 

may decline particularly to the extent that the market price reflects a market assumption that the transaction will be consummated or will be consummated within a particular timeframe 

furthermore most transactions require the company to incur substantial expense associated with closing and if the transaction is not consummated we will incur these expenses without realizing the expected benefits the pursuit of the transaction will also require management attention and use of internal resources that would otherwise be focused on general business operations in addition customers’ uncertainty about the effect of the transaction may have an adverse effect on the ability to win customer contracts or could cause existing clients to seek to change existing business relationships employee morale due to the uncertainties associated with the transaction could also be negatively affected any of the foregoing or other risks arising in connection with a failure or delay in consummating a transaction including the diversion of management attention or loss of other opportunities during the pendency of the transaction could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to regulatory compliance 

past and future environmental health and safety laws could impose significant additional costs and liabilities 

we are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities 

various us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants the liability under these laws may be joint and several we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen cleanup obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

when we perform our services our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions we may be subject to liability claims by employees customers and third parties as a result of such exposures in addition we may be subject to fines penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws a claim if not covered or only partially covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

health safety and environmental laws and regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes thereto could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could for example relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and in turn could negatively impact our revenue changes in the environmental laws and regulations remediation obligations enforcement actions stricter interpretations of existing requirements future discovery of contamination or claims for damages to persons property natural resources or the environment could result in material costs and liabilities that we currently do not anticipate if we fail to comply with any environmental health or safety laws or regulations whether actual or alleged we could be exposed to fines penalties or potential litigation liabilities including costs settlements and judgments any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments which may require us or our clients to obtain and to comply with federal state and local government permits and approvals any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial revocation or modification under various circumstances failure to obtain or comply with or the loss or modification of the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and result of operations 

page 47 

if we fail to comply with federal state local or foreign governmental requirements our business may be adversely affected 

we are subject to us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business for example our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders which requires full compliance with both export regulatory laws and international trafficking in arms regulations “itar” although we have policies and procedures to comply with us and foreign international trade laws the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges or debarment from participation in us government contracts and could damage our reputation and our ability to do business 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act of 2010 and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices despite our training and compliance programs there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions including contract cancellations or debarment and loss of reputation any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change 

growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations legislation international protocols regulation or other restrictions on emissions could result in increased compliance costs for us and our clients and have other impacts on our clients including those who are involved in the exploration production or refining of fossil fuels emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels or emit greenhouse gases through the mining manufacture utilization or production of materials or goods such policy changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or in some cases prevent a project from going forward thereby potentially reducing the need for our services which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations however these changes could also increase the pace of projects such as carbon capture or storage projects that could have a positive impact on our business we cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers 

risks related to our indebtedness 

we rely on cash provided by operations and liquidity under our credit facilities to fund our business negative conditions in the credit and financial markets and delays in receiving client payments could adversely affect our cost of borrowing and our business 

although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions we are currently a borrower under several credit facilities these facilities all contain customary covenants restricting among other things our ability to incur certain liens and indebtedness we are also subject to certain financial covenants including maintenance of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio a breach of any covenant or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under one or more of our credit facilities and limit our ability to do further borrowing instability in the credit markets in the us or abroad could cause the availability of credit to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain at competitive rates on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts this situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds refinance our existing indebtedness enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all we may also enter into business acquisition agreements that require us to access credit which if not available at the closing of the acquisition could result in a breach of the acquisition agreement and a resulting claim for damages by the sellers of such business in addition market conditions 

page 48 

could negatively impact our clients’ ability to fund their projects and therefore utilize our services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors suppliers and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements on less favorable terms with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

some of our customers suppliers and subcontractors depend on access to commercial financing and capital markets to fund their operations disruptions of the credit or capital markets could adversely affect our clients’ ability to finance projects and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions project delays and payment delays or defaults by our clients in addition clients may be unable to fund new projects may choose to make fewer capital expenditures or otherwise slow their spending on our services or to seek contract terms more favorable to them our government clients may face budget deficits that prohibit them from funding proposed and existing projects or that cause them to exercise their right to terminate our contracts with little or no prior notice in addition any financial difficulties suffered by our subcontractors or suppliers could increase our cost or adversely impact project schedules these disruptions could materially impact our backlog and have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are therefore subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices after we have already committed resources to their projects in weak economic environments we may experience increased delays and failures due to among other reasons our clients’ unwillingness to pay for alleged poor performance or to preserve their own working capital if one or more clients delays in paying or fails to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

furthermore our cash balances and shortterm investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america europe south america australia and asia some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership or have been seized by their governments there is a risk that such events may occur in the future if any such events were to occur we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

maintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts 

in line with industry practice we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds or letters of credit to our customers these instruments indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract if a bond or a letter of credit is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond or letter of credit we cannot pursue that project historically we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity but as is typically the case the issuance of a bond is at the surety’s sole discretion and the issuance of a letter of credit is based on the companys creditworthiness because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms in addition future projects may require us to obtain letters of credit that extend beyond the term of our existing credit facilities our inability to obtain adequate bonding and as a result to bid on new contracts that require such bonding or letter of credit could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

page 49 

risks related to our common stock 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly or fall below the expectations of securities analysts which could have a material adverse impact on the price of our common stock fluctuations are caused by a number of factors including 

• legal proceedings disputes andor government investigations 

• fluctuations in the spending patterns of our government and commercial customers 

• the number and significance of projects executed during a quarter 

• unanticipated changes in contract performance particularly with contracts that have funding limits 

• the timing of resolving change orders requests for equitable adjustments and other contract adjustments 

• delays incurred in connection with a project 

• changes in prices of commodities or other supplies 

• changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

• weather conditions that delay work at project sites 

• the timing of expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions or other corporate initiatives 

• the decision by the board of directors to begin or cease paying a dividend and the expectation that if the company pays dividends it would declare dividends at the same or higher levels in the future 

• natural disasters or other crises 

• staff levels and utilization rates 

• changes in prices of services offered by our competitors and 

• general economic and political conditions 

there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends on our common stock 

our board of directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program in fiscal 2017 under which we have paid and intend to continue paying regular quarterly dividends the declaration amount and timing of such dividends are subject to capital availability and determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and applicable agreements our ability to pay dividends will depend upon among other factors our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions including acquisitions debt service requirements results of operations financial condition and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant a reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments andor our dividend program could have a material negative effect on our stock price 

in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make we could dilute share ownership and if we receive stock in connection with a divestiture the value of stock is subject to fluctuation 

one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities if we issue additional equity securities such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders’ individual ownership percentages in the company 

page 50 

in addition if we receive stock or other equity securities in connection with a sale or divestiture of a business the value of such stock will fluctuate andor be subject to trading restrictions stock price changes may result from among other things changes in the business operations or prospects of the issuer prior to or following the transaction litigation or regulatory considerations general business market industry or economic conditions the ability to sell all or a portion of the stock based on current market conditions and other factors both within and beyond the control of the company in addition if the stock received is valued in a currency other than us dollars the value of such stock will also fluctuate based on foreign currency rates for example in connection with the ecr sale the company still holds 513 million ordinary shares of worley received as a portion of the purchase price the value of such shares will fluctuate based on the trading price of the worley shares on the australian securities exchange and the exchange rate of the australian dollar 

delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control 

we are a delaware corporation certain antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us in addition certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover for example 

• only our board of directors can fill vacancies on the board 

• there are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election and 

• our board of directors can authorize the issuance of preferred shares 

these types of provisions as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders accordingly shareholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in order to better understand the changes that occur to key elements of our financial condition results of operations and cash flows a reader of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business performing longterm professional services engineering and constructiontype contracts requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect both the entity’s results of operations and the carrying values of its assets and liabilities although our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k the following discussion is intended to highlight and describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue accounting for contracts 

engineering procurement  construction contracts and service contracts 

on september 29 2018 the company adopted asc topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers including the subsequent asus that amended and clarified the related guidance the company recognizes engineering procurement and construction contract revenue over time as performance obligations are satisfied due to the continuous transfer of control to the customer upon adoption of asc topic 606 contracts which include engineering procurement and construction services are generally accounted for as a single deliverable a single performance obligation and are no longer segmented between types of services in some instances the company’s services associated with a construction activity are limited only to specific tasks such as customer support consulting or supervisory services in these instances the services are typically identified as separate performance obligations 

the company recognizes revenue using the percentageofcompletion method based primarily on contract costs incurred to date compared to total estimated contract costs estimated contract costs include the company’s latest estimates using judgments with respect to labor hours and costs materials and subcontractor costs the percentageofcompletion method an input method is the most representative depiction of the company’s performance because it directly measures the value of the services transferred to the customer subcontractor materials labor and equipment and in certain cases customerfurnished materials and labor and equipment are included in revenue and cost of revenue when management believes that the company is acting as a principal rather than as an agent eg the company integrates the materials labor and equipment into the deliverables promised to the customer or is otherwise primarily responsible for fulfillment and acceptability of the materials labor andor equipment the company recognizes revenue but not profit on certain uninstalled materials that are not specifically produced fabricated or constructed for a project revenue on these uninstalled materials is recognized when control is transferred changes to total estimated contract cost or losses if any are recognized in the period in which they are determined as assessed at the contract level precontract costs are expensed as incurred unless they are expected to be recovered from the client project mobilization costs are generally charged to project costs as incurred when they are an integrated part of the performance obligation being transferred to the client under the typical payment terms of our engineering procurement and construction contracts amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreedupon contractual terms at periodic intervals eg biweekly or monthly and customer payments on are typically due within 30 to 60 days of billing depending on the contract 

page 56 

for service contracts the company recognizes revenue over time using the costtocost percentageofcompletion method service contracts that include multiple performance obligations are segmented between types of services for contracts with multiple performance obligations the company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation using an estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct service in the contract in some instances where the company is standing ready to provide services the company recognizes revenue ratably over the service period under the typical payment terms of our service contracts amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreedupon contractual terms and customer payments are typically due within 30 to 60 days of billing depending on the contract 

direct costs of contracts include all costs incurred in connection with and directly for the benefit of client contracts including depreciation and amortization relating to assets used in providing the services required by the related projects the level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors including the amount of passthrough costs we incur during a period on those projects where we are acting as principal for subcontract labor or thirdparty materials and equipment we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs and we refer to such costs as “passthrough costs” 

variable consideration 

the nature of the company’s contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration including claims and unpriced change orders awards and incentive fees and liquidated damages and penalties the company recognizes revenue for variable consideration when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur the company estimates the amount of revenue to be recognized on variable consideration using the expected value ie the sum of a probabilityweighted amount or the most likely amount method whichever is expected to better predict the amount factors considered in determining whether revenue associated with claims including change orders in dispute and unapproved change orders in regard to both scope and price should be recognized include the following a the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim b additional costs were caused by circumstances that were unforeseen at the contract date and not the result of deficiencies in the company’s performance c claimrelated costs are identifiable and considered reasonable in view of the work performed and d evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable if the requirements for recognizing revenue for claims or unapproved change orders are met revenue is recorded only when the costs associated with the claims or unapproved change orders have been incurred and only up to the amount of cost incurred back charges to suppliers or subcontractors are recognized as a reduction of cost when it is determined that recovery of such cost is probable and the amounts can be reliably estimated disputed back charges are recognized when the same requirements described above for claims accounting have been satisfied 

the company generally provides limited warranties for work performed under its engineering and construction contracts the warranty periods typically extend for a limited duration following substantial completion of the company’s work on the project historically warranty claims have not resulted in material costs incurred for which the company was not compensated for by the customer 

practical expedient 

if the company has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the company’s performance completed to date a service contract in which the company bills a fixed amount for each hour of service provided the company recognizes revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice for services performed 

the company does not adjust the contract price for the effects of a significant financing component if the company expects at contract inception that the period between when the company transfers a service to a customer and when the customer pays for that service will be one year or less 

page 57 

joint ventures and vies 

as is common to the industry we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures although the joint ventures own and hold the contracts with the clients the services required by the contracts are typically performed by us and our joint venture partners or by other subcontractors under subcontracting agreements with the joint ventures many of these joint ventures are formed for a specific project the assets of our joint ventures generally consist almost entirely of cash and receivables representing amounts due from clients and the liabilities of our joint ventures generally consist almost entirely of amounts due to the joint venture partners for services provided by the partners to the joint ventures under their individual subcontracts and other subcontractors in general at any given time the equity of our joint ventures represents the undistributed profits earned on contracts the joint ventures hold with clients very few of our joint ventures have employees or thirdparty debt or credit facilities the debt held by the joint ventures is nonrecourse to the general credit of jacobs 

the assets of a joint venture are restricted for use to the obligations of the particular joint venture and are not available for general operations of the company our risk of loss on these arrangements is usually shared with our partners the liability of each partner is usually joint and several which means that each partner may become liable for the entire risk of loss on the project furthermore on some of our projects the company has granted guarantees which may encumber both our contracting subsidiary company and the company for the entire risk of loss on the project the company is unable to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under outstanding performance guarantees related to joint venture projects due to a number of factors including but not limited to the nature and extent of any contractual defaults by our joint venture partners resource availability potential performance delays caused by the defaults the location of the projects and the terms of the related contracts see note 18 contractual guarantees litigation investigations and insurance for further discussion 

our unconsolidated joint ventures including equity method investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable and impairment losses are recognized for such investments if there is a decline in fair value below carrying value that is considered to be otherthantemporary 

many of the joint ventures are deemed to be variable interest entities “vie” because they lack sufficient equity to finance the activities of the joint venture the company uses a qualitative approach to determine if the company is the primary beneficiary of the vie which considers factors that indicate a party has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the joint venture’s economic performance these factors include the composition of the governing board how board decisions are approved the powers granted to the operational managers and partner that holds that positions and to a certain extent the partner’s economic interest in the joint venture the company analyzes each joint venture initially to determine if it should be consolidated or unconsolidated 

• consolidated if the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie or holds the majority of voting interests of a nonvie and no significant participative rights are available to the other partners 

• unconsolidated if the company is not the primary beneficiary of a vie or does not hold the majority of voting interest of a nonvie 

sharebased payments 

we measure the value of services received from employees and directors in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grantdate fair value of the award the computed value is recognized as a noncash cost on a straightline basis over the period the individual provides services which is typically the vesting period of the award with the exception of the value of awards containing an internal performance measure such as eps growth and roic which is recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period subject to the probability of meeting the performance requirements and adjusted for the number of shares expected to be earned 

accounting for pension plans 

the accounting for pension plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans’ assets and liabilities these assumptions include discount rates investment returns and projected salary increases among others the actuarial assumptions used in determining the funded statuses of the plans are provided in note 13  pension and other postretirement benefit plans of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

page 58 

the expected rates of return on plan assets range from 23 to 75 for fiscal 2020 and 18 to 7 fiscal 2021 we believe the range of rates selected for fiscal 2020 reflects the longterm returns expected on the plans’ assets considering recent market conditions projected rates of inflation the diversification of the plans’ assets and the expected real rates of market returns the discount rates used to compute plan liabilities decreased year over year with a range of 13 to 81 in fiscal 2019 and a range of 02 to 71 2020 these assumptions represent the company’s best estimate of the rates at which its pension obligations could be effectively settled 

changes in the actuarial assumptions often have a material effect on the values assigned to plan assets and liabilities and the associated pension expense for example if the discount rate used to value the net pension benefit obligation “pbo” at october 2 2020 was higher by 05 the pbo would have been lower at that date by approximately 2124 million for nonus plans and by approximately 198 million f or us plans if the expected return on plan assets was higher by 10 the net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2020 would be lower by approximately 203 million for nonus plans and by approximately 34 million for us plans differences between actuarial assumptions and actual performance ie actuarial gains and losses that are not recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost in the period in which such differences arise are recorded to accumulated other comprehensi ve income loss and are recognized as part of net periodic pension cost in future periods in accordance with us gaap management monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in an effort to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used 

contractual guarantees litigation investigations and insurance 

in the normal course of business we make contractual commitments some of which are supported by separate guarantees and on occasion we are a party in a litigation or arbitration proceeding the litigation in which we are involved primarily includes personal injury claims professional liability claims and breach of contract claims where we provide a separate guarantee it is strictly in support of the underlying contractual commitment guarantees take various forms including surety bonds required by law or standby letters of credit loc also referred to as “bank guarantees” or corporate guarantees given to induce a party to enter into a contract with a subsidiary standby locs are also used as security for advance payments or in various other transactions the guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from an arbitrary date to completion of our work eg engineering only to completion of the overall project we record in the consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such guarantees litigation and insurance claims guarantees are accounted for in accordance with asc 46010 guarantees  at fair value at the inception of the guarantee 

we maintain insurance coverage for most insurable aspects of our business and operations our insurance programs have varying coverage limits depending upon the type of insurance and include certain conditions and exclusions which insurance companies may raise in response to any claim that the company brings we have also elected to retain a portion of losses and liabilities that occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under our insurance programs as a result we may be subject to a future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured we intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of the contracts which the company enters with its clients our insurers are also subject to business risk and as a result one or more of them may be unable to fulfill their insurance obligations due to insolvency or otherwise 

additionally as a contractor providing services to the us federal government we are subject to many types of audits investigations and claims by or on behalf of the government including with respect to contract performance pricing cost allocations procurement practices labor practices and socioeconomic obligations furthermore our income franchise and similar tax returns and filings are also subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service most states within the united states as well as by various government agencies representing jurisdictions outside the united states 

our consolidated balance sheets include amounts representing our probable estimated liability relating to such claims guarantees litigation audits and investigations our estimates of probable liabilities require us to make assumptions related to potential losses regarding our determination of amounts considered probable and estimable we perform an analysis to determine the level of reserves to establish for insurancerelated claims that are known and have been asserted against us as well as for insurancerelated claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates we include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations insurance recoveries are recorded as assets if recovery is probable and estimated liabilities are not reduced by expected insurance recoveries 

page 59 

the company believes after consultation with counsel that such guarantees litigation us government contractrelated audits investigations and claims and income tax audits and investigations should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements beyond amounts currently accrued 

testing goodwill for possible impairment 

the goodwill carried on our consolidated balance sheets is tested annually for possible impairment and on an interim basis if indicators of possible impairment exist for purposes of impairment testing goodwill is assigned to the applicable reporting units based on the current reporting structure in performing the annual impairment test we evaluate our goodwill at the reporting unit level the company performs the annual goodwill impairment test for the reporting units at the beginning of the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 

us gaap does not prescribe a specific valuation method for estimating the fair value of reporting units any valuation technique used to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including revenue growth rates operating margins discount rates and future market conditions among others 

we used income and market approaches to test our goodwill for possible impairment which requires us to make estimates and judgments under the income approach fair value is determined by using the discounted cash flows of our reporting units the company’s discount rate reflects a weighted average cost of capital “wacc” for a peer group of companies representative of the company’s respective reporting units under the market approach the fair values of our reporting units are determined by reference to guideline companies that are reasonably comparable to our reporting units the fair values are estimated based on the valuation multiples of the invested capital associated with the guideline companies in assessing whether there is an indication that the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired we utilize the results of both valuation techniques and consider the range of fair values indicated 

it is possible that changes in market conditions economy facts and circumstances judgments and assumptions used in estimating the fair value could change resulting in possible impairment of goodwill in the future the fair values resulting from the valuation techniques used are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of the reporting units to willing third parties 

we have determined that the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values for the consolidated balance sheets presented 

impairment of longlived assets 

our longlived assets other than goodwill principally consist of rightofuse lease assets property equipment and improvements and finitelived intangible assets these longlived assets are evaluated for impairment for each of our asset groups in accordance with asc 360 by first identifying whether indicators of impairment exist if such indicators are present we assess longlived asset groups for recoverability based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows for asset groups where the recoverability test fails the fair value of each asset group is then estimated and compared to its carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which an asset group’s carrying value exceeds its fair value

2020 overview 

  covid19 pandemic there are many risks and uncertainties regarding the covid19 pandemic including the anticipated duration of the pandemic and the extent of local and worldwide social political and economic disruption it may cause the company’s operations for the last three quarters of fiscal 2020 were adversely impacted by covid19 while certain business units of both critical mission solutions and people  places solutions have experienced and may continue to experience an increase in demand for certain of their services regarding new projects that may arise in response to the covid19 pandemic it is still expected that covid19 is likely to continue to have an adverse impact on each of critical missions solutions and people  places solutions in fiscal 2021 although to a lesser degree than what was seen in 2020 

please refer to item 1a  risk factors  for a discussion of risks and uncertainties related to covid19 including the potential impacts on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

net earnings attributable to the company from continuing operations for fiscal 2020 were 3539 million or 267 per diluted share an increase of 629 million or 216 from 2910 million or 209 per diluted share for the prior year included in the company’s operating results for the current year were 569 million or 043 per share in after tax fair value losses recorded in miscellaneous income expense net associated with our investment in worley stock net of worley stock dividend and certain foreign currency revaluations relating to the ecr sale and 2482 million in aftertax restructuring and other charges and transaction costs associated in part with the companys fourth quarter fiscal 2020 transformation initiatives relating to real estate and other staffing programs which are discussed in note 16 restructuring and other charges also fiscal 2020 results were impacted by charges associated with the companys acquisition of john wood groups nuclear consulting remediation and program management business along with charges relating to the integration of the keyw and ch2m acquisitions and the sale of ecr our fiscal 2019 results included 2598 million or 186 per share in aftertax restructuring and other charges and transactions costs associated with the companys keyw and ch2m acquisitions and the ecr sale also included in the fiscal 2019 net earnings from continuing operations are 481 million in aftertax fair value losses associated with our i nvestment in worley stock net of worley stock dividend and certain foreign currency revaluations relating to ecr sale proceeds income tax expense for continuing operations for fiscal 2020 was 553 million an increase of 184 million or 497 from 370 million in the prior year key drivers for this yearoveryear increase in the effective tax rate include a reduction in valuation allowance releases in fiscal year 2020 as well as an increase in tax on foreign earnings in the us 

net earnings attributable to jacobs from discontinued operations for fiscal 2020 were 1380 million or 104 per diluted share a decrease of 4190 million or 752 from 5570 million or 400 per diluted share for the prior year included in net earnings attributable to the company from discontinued operations for the current year was an expense reduction for the settlement of the nui phao npmc legal matter described in note 17 commitments and contingencies and derivative financial instruments that was reimbursed by insurance the recognition of the deferred gain for the delayed conveyance of the international entities and for the delivery of the ecr it assets as discussed in note 15 sale of energy chemicals and resources ecr business and adjustments for working capital and certain other items in connection with the ecr sale additionally the yearoveryear change was also driven by the gain on sale recognized in the fiscal 2019 period and the absence of normal operating results of the ecr business as reported in the prior year included in the current year results from discontinued operations is the pretax gain on sale of the ecr business of 1102 million  included in prior year results from discontinued operations is the pretax gain on the sale of the ecr business of 9351 million see note 15 sale of energy chemicals and resources ecr business 

  on march 6 2020 a subsidiary of jacobs completed the acquisition of the nuclear consulting remediation and program management business of john wood group for an enterprise value of £246 million or approximately 3179 million less cash acquired of 243 million on june 12 2019 we acquired keyw a us based national security solutions provider to the intelligence cyber and counterterrorism communities on december 15 2017 we acquired ch2m a provider of international engineering construction and technical services

fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 

revenues for the year ended october 2 2020 were 1357 billion an increase of 8291 million or 65 from 1274 billion for the prior year the increase in revenues was due primarily to the a full year of revenues in fiscal 2020 from the keyw acquisition completed in june 2019 impacts from the march 2020 john wood group nuclear business acquisition and growth in our legacy people  places solutions businesses offset in part by impacts from the covid 19 pandemic also our revenues were impacted by an extra week of activity in fiscal 2020 see note 1 description of business and basis of presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

passthrough costs included in revenues for the year ended october 2 2020 were 261 billion in comparison to 254 billion in the prior year in general passthrough costs are more significant on projects that have a higher content of field services activities passthrough costs are generally incurred at specific points during the life cycle of a project and are highly dependent on the needs of our individual clients and the nature of the clients’ projects however because we have hundreds of projects which start at various times within a fiscal year the effect of passthrough costs on the level of direct costs of contracts can vary between fiscal years without there being a fundamental or significant change to the underlying business 

gross profit for the year ended october 2 2020 was 259 billion up 1096 million or 44 from 248 billion for the prior year our gross profit margins were 191 and 194 for the years ended october 2 2020 and september 27 2019 respectively the increase in our gross profit was attributable to favorable impacts from the keyw and john wood group nuclear business acquisitions also impacted by the extra week of activity in fiscal 2020 the slight differences in year over year gross margin trends were attributable mainly to legacy portfolio mix and lower overhead rate impacts on revenue with partial offsets from favorable margin trends from our recent keyw and john wood group nuclear business acquisitions and as well as year over year impacts from lower overhead reimbursement rates resulting from our ongoing cost reduction programs partially offset by covid19 cost mitigation efforts 

see segment financial information discussion for further information on the company’s results of operations at the operating segment level 

selling general  administrative expenses for the year ended october 2 2020 were 205 billion a decrease of 215 million or 10 from 207 billion for the prior year the decrease in sga expenses as compared to the prior year was due primarily to less expense relating to the transition services agreement the tsa with worley which expired in april 2020 although the parties agreed to extend certain of the services beyond the initial term and reductions in personnel related and other overhead costs resulting from our ongoing cost reduction programs as well as covid19 cost mitigation efforts partially offset by incremental sga expenses from the keyw and john wood group nuclear business acquisitions and the extra week of activity in fiscal 2020 also included in the current year results were 3251 million of restructuring and other charges and transaction costs associated in part with the companys fourth quarter fiscal 2020 transformation initiatives relating to real estate and other staffing programs and the companys acquisition of john wood groups nuclear business in comparison the prior year included 3503 million of restructuring and other charges and transaction costs favorable impacts on sga expenses from foreign exchange were 32 million for the current year 

net interest expense for the year ended october 2 2020 was 575 million a decrease of 169 million from 744 million for the prior year the decrease in net interest expense year over year is primarily due to the paydown of debt subsequent to the ecr sale in the prior year third quarter 

miscellaneous income expense net for the year ended october 2 2020 was 373 million a decrease of 578 million as compared to 205 million in income for the prior year the decrease from the prior year was due primarily to 745 million in pretax unrealized losses associated with changes in the fair value of our investment in worley stock net of worley stock dividend and certain foreign currency revaluations relating to the ecr sale in the current year compared to 648 million in the prior year also included in miscellaneous expense income during the current year is 158 million in tsarelated income associated with the ecr sale compared to 354 million in the prior year as discussed in note 15 sale of energy chemicals and resources ecr business further miscellaneous income expense net for the year ended september 27 2019 included a onetime gain on the settlement of the ch2m retiree medical plan of 350 million 

net earnings attributable to jacobs from discontinued operations for fiscal 2020 were 1380 million or 104 per diluted share a decrease of 4190 million or 752 from 5570 million or 400 per diluted share for the prior year included in net earnings attributable to the company from discontinued operations for the current year was an expense reduction for the settlement of the nui phao npmc legal matter described in note 17 commitments and contingencies and derivative financial instruments that was reimbursed by insurance the recognition of the deferred gain

for the delayed conveyance of the international entities and for the delivery of the ecr it assets as discussed in note 15 sale of energy chemicals and resources ecr business and adjustments for working capital and certain other items in connection with the ecr sale additionally the yearoveryear change was also driven by the gain on sale recognized in the fiscal 2019 period and the absence of normal operating results of the ecr business as reported in the prior year included in the current year results from discontinued operations is the pretax gain on sale of the ecr business of 1102 million  included in prior year results from discontinued operations is the pretax gain on the sale of the ecr business of 9351 million see note 15 sale of energy chemicals and resources ecr business 

the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate of 125 is lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to a 169 million benefit from foreign valuation allowance releases 265 million of foreign tax generated in the current year a benefit of 73 million from the application of the internal revenue code section 179d a reduction in uncertain tax positions of 113 million and benefits from tax rate changes and stock compensation these decreases in tax expense were offset by 430 million of us foreign inclusions within us tax costs of foreign operations 

the following table reconciles total income tax expense on continuing operations using the statutory us federal income tax rate to the consolidated income tax expense on continuing operations shown in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings for the years ended october 2 2020 and september 27 2019 dollars in thousands 



the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate for the year ended october 2 2020 increased to 125 from 105 for fiscal 2019 key drivers for this year over year increase in the effective tax rate include a reduction in valuation allowance releases in fiscal 2020 as well as an increase in tax on foreign earnings in the us 

fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 

revenues for the year ended september 27 2019 were 1274 billion an increase of 216 billion or 204 from 1058 billion for the corresponding period in 2018 the increase in revenues was due primarily to the ch2m acquisition in december fiscal 2018 included in fiscal 2019 for the full year impacts from the keyw acquisition included in the fiscal 2019 results since closing in midjune and growth in our legacy cms and pps businesses 

page 64 

passthrough costs included in revenues for the year ended september 27 2019 were 254 billion in comparison to 225 billion in the prior year these yearoveryear increases are due primarily to impacts from the ch2m acquisition included for the full year of fiscal 2019 

gross profit for the year ended september 27 2019 was 248 billion an increase of 3185 million or 148 from 216 billion for the corresponding period in 2018 our gross profit margins were 194 and 204 for the years ended september 27 2019 and september 28 2018 respectively revenue mix primarily drove the lower gross profit and margin for the year over year periods 

selling general  administrative expenses for the year ended september 27 2019 were 207 billion an increase of 030 billion or 170 from 177 billion for the corresponding period in 2018 the increase in sga expenses is due mainly to incremental sga expense from the ch2m and keyw businesses acquired also included in the 2019 results were 3503 million of restructuring and other charges and transaction costs as well as higher personnel related costs year over year due in part to costs to service the tsa with worley in comparison the prior year included 2305 million of restructuring and other charges and transaction costs 

net interest expense for the year ended september 27 2019 was 744 million an increase of 66 million from 678 million for the corresponding period in 2018 the increase in net interest expense as compared to the corresponding period in 2018 was due primarily to higher levels of debt outstanding and our fixed rate notes having been outstanding for the full year of fiscal 2019 and only five months in fiscal 2018 

miscellaneous income expense net for the year ended september 27 2019 was 205 million an increase of 92 million as compared to 113 million for the corresponding period in 2018 the increase was due primarily to the gain on the settlement of the ch2m retiree medical plan of 350 million and income from the tsa with worley of 354 million offset by 648 million net relating to ecr related fair value adjustments unrealized losses and dividend income related to our investment in worley stock and certain foreign currency revaluations relating to ecr sale proceeds 

net earnings of the group from discontinued operations was 5592 million for the year ended september 27 2019 an increase of 3914 million from 1678 million for the corresponding period in 2018 included in 2019 was the pretax gain on the sale of the ecr business of 9351 million offset in part by a charge for the final settlement of the nui phao legal matter the 2018 fiscal year included a 210 million loss associated with the disposal of the companys equity investment in its guimar joint venture

backlog information 

we include in backlog the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us our policy with respect to operations  maintenance om contracts however is to include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for one succeeding year regardless of the remaining life of the contract for national government programs other than national government om contracts which are subject to the same policy applicable to all other om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding option periods because of variations in the nature size expected duration funding commitments and the scope of services required by our contracts the timing of when backlog will be recognized as revenues can vary greatly between individual contracts 

consistent with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the option of the client including our us government work while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog at any given time our backlog is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein backlog is not necessarily an indicator of future revenues 

because certain contracts eg contracts relating to large engineering procurement  construction epc projects as well as national government programs can cause large increases to backlog in the fiscal period in which we recognize the award and because many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over several fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years we evaluate our backlog generally on a yearoveryear basis but also on a sequential quarteroverquarter basis where appropriate 

please refer to item 1a risk factors  above for a discussion of other factors that may cause backlog to ultimately convert into revenues at different amounts 

the following table summarizes our backlog for the years ended october 2 2020 september 27 2019 and september 28 2018 in millions 



the increase in backlog in critical mission solutions for the years presented was primarily the result of new awards from the us federal government and the acquisition of john wood groups nuclear consulting remediation and program management business in fiscal 2020 

the increase in backlog in people  places solutions for the years presented was primarily the result of new awards in the uk and us markets 

backlog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies totaled approximately 85 billion or 357 of total backlog 88 billion or 391 of total backlog and 68 billion or 341 of total backlog at october 2 2020 september 27 2019 and september 28 2018 respectively most of our federal government contracts require that services be provided beyond one year in general these contracts must be funded annually ie the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the us congress to the procuring agency and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts 

we estimate that approximately 748 billion or 314 of total backlog at october 2 2020 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year 

consolidated backlog differs from the company’s remaining performance obligations as defined by asc 606 primarily because of our national government contracts other than national government om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding the option periods while our remaining performance obligations represent a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress additionally the company includes our proportionate share of backlog related to unconsolidated joint ventures which is not included in our remaining performan ce obligations

liquidity and capital resources 

at october 2 2020 our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 8624 million in cash and cash equivalents and 209 billion of available borrowing capacity under our 225 billion revolving credit agreement the revolving credit facility we finance much of our operations and growth through cash generated by our operations 

the amount of cash and cash equivalents at october 2 2020 represented an increase of 2314 million from 6311 million at september 27 2019 the reasons for which are described below 

our cash flow provided by operations of 8068 million during fisc al 2020 was comparatively higher than the 3664 million in cash flow used for operations for the prior year  this improvement was due primarily to favorable net cash earnings driven in part by improved operating profit performance and mitiga ting actions from the company in response to the covid19 pandemic additionally this favorable trend in cash from operations benefited from lower working capital levels due mainly to higher levels of cash used in the prior year for income taxes payable largely attributable to taxes paid on the gain from the ecr sale and favorable cash flow impacts in accrued liabilities including the deferral of certain payments associated mainly with covid19 government assistance programs in the us and europe offset mainly by higher cash used in accounts payable 

our cash used for investing activities for fiscal 2020 of 4291 million was comparatively lower t han the 22 billion cash provided by investing activ ities for the prior year the change was due primarily to the impact in 2019 of 280 billion in cash proceeds associated with the ecr sale and cash paid for the keyw acquisition of 5751 million net of cash acquired on a comparative basis cash used in investing activities included approximately 2936 million in cash paid for the john wood groups nuclear business net of cash acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 

our cash used for financing activit ies of 2083 million in fiscal 2020 resulted mainly from share repurchases of 3373 million and dividend payments to both shareholders and noncontrolling interests totaling 1440 million offset by net proceeds from borrowings of 2653 million  cash used for financing activities was 20 billion in fiscal 2019 resulted mainly from net repayments of borrowings of 10 billion primarily related to repayments with cash received from the ecr sale common stock repurchases of 8537 million and dividend payments to both shareholders and noncontrolling interests of 1064 million 

at october 2 2020 the company had approximately 1530 million in cash and cash equivalents held in the us and 7094 million held outside of the us primarily in the uk the eurozone australia india and the united arab emirates which is used primarily for funding operations in those regions other than the tax cost of repatriating funds to the us see note 7 income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k there are no material impediments to repatriating these funds to the us 

in march 2020 the company entered into a new unsecured term loan facility the “2020 term loan facility” with a syndicate of financial institutions as lenders the principal balance of the 2020 term loan facility wa s 10 billion a s of october 2 2020 the terms and other important details are summarized in note 9 borrowings  the 2020 term loan facility was entered into as part of our strategy to increase the portion of our longterm debt that is represented by term loan facilities during fiscal 2020 the company used proceeds of the 2020 term loan facility to repay 2000 million i n shortterm debt and all but 1528 million in outstanding amounts under the revolving credit facility 

the company had 2630 million in letters of credit outstanding at october 2 2020 of this amount 23 million was issued under the revolving credit facility and 2607 million wa s issued under separate committed and uncommitted letterofcredit facilities 

on march 6 2020 a subsidiary of jacobs completed the acquisition of john wood groups nuclear consulting remediation and program management business for an enterprise value of £246 million or approximately 3179 million less cash acquired of 243 million the company has recorded its preliminary purchase accounting processes associated with the acquisitions which are summarized in note 14 business combinations  

on june 12 2019 jacobs completed the acquisition of keyw by acquiring 100 of the outstanding shares of keyw common stock the company paid total consideration of 9026 million which was comprised of approximately 6042 million in cash to the former stockholders and certain equity award holders of keyw and the assumption of keyw’s debt of 2984 million the company repaid keyws outstanding debt by the end of the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019 the company has recorded its final purchase accounting associated with the acquisition which is summarized in note 14 business combinations

we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our projected cash requirements for the next twelve months based on the liquidity provided by our cash and cash equivalents on hand our borrowing capacity and our continuing cash from operations we further believe that our financial resources and discretionary spend controls as well as near term benefits from government assistance programs will allow us to continue managing the negative impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our business operations for the foreseeable future which is expected to include reduced revenue from operating activities based on current assumptions and expectations regarding the pandemic we have taken actions to reduce spending more broadly across the company only proceeding with operating and capital spending that is critical we have also ceased all nonessential hiring and reduced discretionary expenses including certain employee benefits and compensation in addition as a precautionary measure we temporarily suspended purchases under the share repurchase plan in march 2020 with such suspension remaining in effect through the third fiscal quarter of 2020 looking ahead we have developed contingency plans to reduce costs further if the situation deteriorates beyond or lasts longer than current assumptions and expectations 

we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants at october 2 2020

limitations on effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its system of internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed or operated can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of internal control are met the design of the company’s control system reflects the fact that there are resource constraints and that the benefits of such control systems must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control failures and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the intentional acts of individuals by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that the design of any particular control will always succeed in achieving its objective under all potential future conditions

energy chemicals and resources ecr 

ecr disposition 

on april 26 2019 jacobs completed the sale of its energy chemicals and resources ecr business to worley limited a company incorporated in australia worley for a purchase price of 34 billion consisting of i 28 billion in cash plus ii 582 million ordinary shares of worley subject to adjustments for changes in working capital and certain other items the ecr sale 

as a result of the ecr sale substantially all ecrrelated assets and liabilities have been sold the disposal group we determined that the disposal group should be reported as discontinued operations in accordance with asc 21005 discontinued operations because their disposal represents a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and financial results as such the financial results of the ecr business are reflected in our noncurrent assets and liabilities of the disposal group are reflected as heldforsale in the consolidated balance sheet as of september 28 2018 further as of the year ended september 27 2019 a portion of the ecr business remains held by jacobs as described above and continues to be classified as held for sale for the year ended september 27 2019 in accordance with us gaap for further discussion see note 7 sale of energy chemicals and resources ecr business to the consolidated financial statements 

prior to the sale the ecr business served the energy chemicals and resources sectors including upstream midstream and downstream oil gas refining chemicals and mining and minerals industries the ecr business provided integrated delivery of complex projects for our oil and gas refining and petrochemicals clients bridging the upstream midstream and downstream industries ecrs services encompassed consulting engineering procurement construction maintenance and project management 

significant customers 

the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government for each of the last three fiscal years 



given the percentage of total revenue derived directly from the us federal government the loss of us federal government agencies as customers would have a material adverse effect on the company in addition any or all of our government contracts could be terminated we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work or payment of our costs could be disallowed approximately 71 of revenue derived directly from the us federal government is in the cms segment for more information on risks relating to our government contracts see item 1a  risk factors 

financial information about geographic areas 

selected financial information regarding the geographic areas in which we operate is included in note 19  segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k and is incorporated herein by reference for fiscal 2019  approximately 29 of our revenues were earned from clients outside the united states our international operations are subject to a variety of risks which are described under item 1a  risk factors below 

contracts 

while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake our contracts generally fall into two broad categories costreimbursable and fixedprice the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the last three fiscal years 



page 17 

in accordance with industry practice most of our contracts including those with the us federal government are subject to termination at the discretion of the client which is discussed in greater detail in item 1a  risk factors  in such situations our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination 

costreimbursable contracts 

costreimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit the profit element may be in the form of a simple markup applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee or a combination of a markup and a fee the fee element can also take several forms the fee may be a fixed amount it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred or it may be an incentive fee based on targets milestones or performance factors defined in the contract 

fixedprice contracts 

fixedprice contracts include both “lump sum bid” contracts and “negotiated fixedprice” contracts under lump sum bid contracts we typically bid against competitors based on clientfurnished specifications this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period additionally it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients which is contrary to our relationshipbased business model accordingly lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract in contrast under a negotiated fixedprice contract we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client negotiated fixedprice contracts frequently exist in singleresponsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project thus although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us in our services contracts as well as construction however because of economies that may be realized during the contract term both negotiated fixedprice and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts the company carefully manages the risk inherent in these types of contracts in recent years most of our fixedprice work has been either negotiated fixedprice contracts or lump sum bid contracts for design andor project services rather than turnkey construction 

competition 

we compete with a large number of companies across the world including technology consulting federal it services aerospace defense and engineering firms typically no single company or companies dominate the markets in which we provide services and in many cases we partner with our competitors or other companies to jointly pursue projects aecom booz allen caci kbr leidos parsons saic general dynamics and northrop grumman are some of our competitors we compete based on the following factors among others technical capabilities reputation for quality price of services safety record availability of qualified personnel and ability to timely perform work and contract terms 

employees 

at september 27 2019  we had approximately 48000 fulltime staff employees including contract staff additionally as of september 27 2019  there were approximately 4000 persons employed in the field on a project basis the number of field employees varies in relation to the number and size of the maintenance and construction projects in progress at any particular time

risk factors 

tableend we operate in a changing global environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future we may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial if any such events actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

project sites are inherently dangerous workplaces if we the owner or others working at the project site fail to maintain safe work sites we can be exposed to significant financial losses and reputational harm as well as civil and criminal liabilities 

project sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment moving vehicles chemical and manufacturing processes and highly regulated materials in a challenging environment and often in geographically remote locations if we or others working at such sites fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective or if others working at the site fail to implement and follow appropriate safety procedures our employees and others may become injured disabled or even lose their lives the completion or commencement of our projects may be delayed and we may be exposed to litigation or investigations unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover increase the cost of a project to our clients and raise our operating and insurance costs any of the foregoing could result in financial losses or reputational harm which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials which if improperly handled or disposed of could subject us to civil andor criminal liabilities we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health safety and environmental “hse” work procedures throughout our organization including project sites and maintenance sites the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability in addition despite the work of our functional groups we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel or that there will be no damage to or loss of our work equipment or supplies 

our safety record is critical to our reputation many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures accordingly if we fail to maintain adequate safety standards we could suffer reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

past and future environmental health and safety laws could impose significant additional costs and liabilities 

we are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities 

various us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants the liability under these laws may be joint and several we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen cleanup obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

page 20 

when we perform our services our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions we may be subject to liability claims by employees customers and third parties as a result of such exposures in addition we may be subject to fines penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws a claim if not covered or only partially covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

health safety and environmental laws and regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes thereto could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could for example relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and in turn could negatively impact our revenue changes in the environmental laws and regulations remediation obligations enforcement actions stricter interpretations of existing requirements future discovery of contamination or claims for damages to persons property natural resources or the environment could result in material costs and liabilities that we currently do not anticipate if we fail to comply with any environmental health or safety laws or regulations whether actual or alleged we could be exposed to fines penalties or potential litigation liabilities including costs settlements and judgments any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments which may require us or our clients to obtain and to comply with federal state and local government permits and approvals any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial revocation or modification under various circumstances failure to obtain or comply with or the loss or modification of the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and result of operations 

our results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the performance of these contracts 

our revenues are derived from new contract awards delays in the timing of the awards or cancellations of such projects as a result of economic conditions material and equipment pricing and availability or other factors could impact our longterm projected results it is particularly difficult to predict whether or when we will receive largescale projects as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process which is affected by a number of factors such as market conditions or governmental and environmental approvals since a significant portion of our revenues is generated from such projects our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards and the commencement or progress of work under awarded contracts furthermore many of these contracts are subject to financing contingencies and as a result we are subject to the risk that the customer will not be able to secure the necessary financing for the project 

in addition many of our contracts require us to satisfy specific progress or performance milestones in order to receive payment from the customer as a result we may incur significant costs for engineering materials components equipment labor or subcontractors prior to receipt of payment from a customer 

the uncertainty of our contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs in some cases we maintain and bear the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than necessary under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards if an expected contract award is delayed or not received we may incur additional costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we engage in a highly competitive business if we are unable to compete effectively we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

we face intense competition to provide technical professional and construction management services to clients the markets we serve are highly competitive and we compete against a large number of regional national and multinational companies the extent and type of our competition varies by industry geographic area and project type 

our projects are frequently awarded through a competitive bidding process which is standard in our industry we are constantly competing for project awards based on pricing schedule and the breadth and technical sophistication of our services competition can place downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins which may force us to accept contractual terms and conditions that are less favorable to us thereby increasing the risk that among other things we may not realize profit margins at the same rates as we have seen in the past or may 

page 21 

become responsible for costs or other liabilities we have not accepted in the past if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both which if significant could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the nature of our contracts particularly those that are fixedprice subjects us to risks of cost overruns we may experience reduced profits or in some cases losses if costs increase above budgets or estimates or if the project experiences schedule delays 

for fiscal 2019  approximately 24 of our revenues were earned under fixedprice contracts both fixedprice and many cost reimbursable contracts require us to estimate the total cost of the project in advance of our performance for fixedprice contracts we may benefit from any costsavings but we bear greater risk of paying some if not all of any cost overruns fixedprice contracts are established in part on partial or incomplete designs cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions including those about future economic conditions commodity and other materials pricing and availability of labor equipment and materials and other exigencies if the design or the estimates prove inaccurate or if circumstances change due to among other things unanticipated technical problems difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals changes in local laws or labor conditions weather or other delays beyond our control changes in the costs of equipment or raw materials our vendors’ or subcontractors’ inability or failure to perform or changes in general economic conditions then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or in some cases a loss for that project these risks are exacerbated for projects with longterm durations because there is an increased risk that the circumstances on which we based our original estimates will change in a manner that increases costs if the project is significant or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our contracts that are fundamentally cost reimbursable in nature may also present a risk to the extent the final cost on a project exceeds the amount the customer expected or budgeted like fixedprice contracts the expected cost of costreimbursable projects are based in part on partial design and our estimates of the resources and time necessary to perform such contracts a portion of the fee is often linked to these estimates and the related final cost and schedule objectives and if for whatever reason these objectives are not met the project may be less profitable than we expect or even result in losses 

the loss of or a significant reduction in business from one or a few customers could have a material adverse impact on us 

a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue andor backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years for example in fiscal 2019  2018 and 2017  approximately 27  32 and 30  respectively of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government although we have longstanding relationships with many of our significant clients our clients may unilaterally reduce delay or cancel their contracts at any time our loss of or a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted canceled or suspended by our clients and therefore our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings additionally even if fully performed our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins 

backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us as of the end of fiscal 2019  our backlog totaled approximately 226 billion  there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or if realized will result in profits in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation termination or suspension at the discretion of the client including our us government work in the event of a project cancellation we would generally have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project the risk of contracts in backlog being canceled or suspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns or in response to changes in commodity prices 

page 22 

the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts the revenue for certain contracts included in backlog is based on estimates additionally the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence future profitability 

in some markets there is a continuing trend towards costreimbursable contracts with incentivefee arrangements typically our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs overall safety performance overall client satisfaction and other performance criteria if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards we may receive a lower or even zero incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins accordingly there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog assuming they produce the revenues currently expected will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies which are a significant source of our revenue and profit are subject to various uncertainties restrictions and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities as well as profit and cost controls which could result in withholding or delay of payments to us government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding such as sequestration and budget deficits contracts with the us federal government for example are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding us government shutdowns or any related understaffing of the government departments or agencies that interact with our business could result in program cancellations disruptions andor stop work orders could limit the government’s ability to effectively progress programs and make timely payments and could limit our ability to perform on our existing us government contracts and successfully compete for new work governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for government programs may even be eliminated legislatures typically appropriate funds on a yearbyyear basis while contract performance may take more than one year as a result contracts with government agencies may be only partially funded or may be terminated and we may not realize all of the potential revenue and profit from those contracts 

our government clients may reduce the scope of or terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues for example those with the us federal government represented approximately 27 of our total revenue in fiscal 2019  a significant reduction in government funding or the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

most government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process the us federal government has increasingly relied upon multipleyear contracts with multiple contractors that generally require those contractors to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under a contract this process may result in us facing significant additional pricing pressure and uncertainty and incurring additional costs moreover we may not be awarded government contracts because of existing policies designed to protect small businesses and underrepresented minorities our inability to win new contracts or be awarded work under existing contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socioeconomic requirements which affect how we transact business with our clients and in some instances impose additional costs on our business operations for example for contracts with the us federal government we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation the truth in negotiations act the cost accounting standards and numerous regulations governing environmental protection and employment practices government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than nongovernment contracts this includes for example unlimited indemnification obligations 

we also are subject to government audits investigations and proceedings for example government agencies such as the us defense contract audit agency routinely review and audit us to determine the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies and whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations these audits can result in a determination that a rule or regulation has been violated or that adjustments are necessary to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies 

page 23 

if we violate a rule or regulation fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit a variety of penalties can be imposed on us including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties for example in socalled “qui tam” actions brought by individuals or the government under the us federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws treble damages can be awarded in addition any or all of our government contracts could be terminated we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work or payment of our costs could be disallowed the occurrence of any of these actions could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances which can be difficult and time consuming to obtain if our employees or our facilities are unable to obtain or retain the necessary security clearances our clients could terminate or not renew existing contracts or award us new contracts which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

our project execution activities may result in liability for faulty services 

if we fail to provide our services in accordance with applicable professional standards or contractual requirements we could be exposed to significant monetary damages or even criminal violations our engineering practice for example involves professional judgments regarding the planning design development construction operations and management of industrial facilities and public infrastructure projects while we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages in our contracts and although we have adopted a range of insurance risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities a catastrophic event at one of our project sites or completed projects resulting from the services we have performed could result in significant professional or product liability and warranty or other claims against us as well as reputational harm especially if public safety is impacted these liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or the fees we generate may not be covered by insurance at all due to various exclusions in our coverage and could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future further even where coverage applies the policies have deductibles which result in our assumption of exposure for certain amounts with respect to any claim filed against us in addition clients or subcontractors who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us an uninsured claim either in part or in whole as well as any claim covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible if successful and of a material magnitude could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are a party to claims and litigation in the normal course of business including litigation inherited through acquisitions since we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities and projects where design construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or others we are exposed to substantial claims and litigation and investigations if there is a failure at any such facility or project such claims could relate to among other things personal injury loss of life business interruption property damage pollution and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties such as those who use or reside near our clients’ projects we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met in many of our contracts with clients subcontractors and vendors we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages penalties losses and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts in addition while clients and subcontractors may agree to indemnify us against certain liabilities such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us 

with a workforce of approximately 52000 people globally we are also party to labor and employment claims in the normal course of business such claims could relate to allegations of harassment and discrimination pay equity denial of benefits wage and hour violations whistleblower protections concerted protected activity and other employment protections and may be pursued on an individual or class action basis depending on applicable laws and regulations some of such claims may be insurable while other such claims may not 

we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations our insurance programs have varying coverage limits as well as exclusions for matters such as fraud and insurance companies may attempt to deny claims for which we seek coverage in addition we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles retentions and limits under these programs as a result we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured 

page 24 

although in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future or that such insurance can be economically secured for example catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits coverage that is more limited or increased premium costs or higher deductibles we monitor the financial health of the insurance companies from which we procure insurance which is one of the factors we take into account when purchasing insurance our insurance is purchased from a number of the worlds leading providers often in layered insurance or quota share arrangements if any of our third party insurers fail abruptly cancel our coverage or otherwise cannot satisfy their insurance requirements to us then our overall risk exposure and operational expenses could be increased and our business operations could be interrupted 

in addition the nature of our business sometimes results in clients subcontractors and vendors presenting claims to us for among other things recovery of costs related to certain projects similarly we occasionally present change orders and claims to our clients subcontractors and vendors for among other things additional costs exceeding the original contract price if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients subcontractors and vendors we could incur cost overruns reduced profits or in some cases a loss for a project further these claims can be the subject of lengthy negotiations arbitration or litigation proceedings which could result in the investment of significant amounts of working capital pending the resolution of the relevant change orders and claims a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results additionally irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant 

litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability product liability criminal liability warranty obligations default under our credit agreements and other liabilities which to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control 

as is common in our industry we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures partnerships and similar arrangements this situation exposes us to a number of risks including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients 

further we have limited ability to control the actions of our joint venture partners including with respect to nonperformance default bankruptcy or legal or regulatory compliance our partners may be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships if these circumstances occur we may be liable for claims and losses attributable to the partner by operation of law or contract these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend on the management effectiveness of our joint venture partners differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major issues which could materially affect the business and operations of these ventures in addition in many of the countries in which we engage in joint ventures it may be difficult to enforce our contractual rights under the applicable joint venture agreement if we are not able to enforce our contractual rights we may not be able to realize the benefits of the joint venture or we may be subject to additional liabilities 

we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner in these cases we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the failure by a joint venture partner to comply with applicable laws regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and for government clients could result in fines penalties suspension or even debarment being imposed on us which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

page 25 

we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts 

thirdparty subcontractors we hire perform much of the work performed under our contracts we also rely on thirdparty equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired if we are not able to locate qualified thirdparty subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated especially in a lump sum or a fixedprice contract we may suffer losses on these contracts if a subcontractor supplier or manufacturer fails to provide services supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason we may be required to source these services equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms which could impact contract profitability there is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors relating to among other things the quality and timeliness of work performed customer concerns about the subcontractor or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a contract in addition faulty workmanship equipment or materials could impact the overall project resulting in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications 

in an uncertain or downturn economic environment third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party’s ability to provide materials equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a failure by a third party subcontractor supplier or manufacturer to comply with applicable laws regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and for government clients could result in fines penalties suspension or even debarment being imposed on us which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

employee agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts which could result in reduced revenues and profits 

misconduct fraud noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or other improper activities by one of our employees agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations regulations regarding the protection of classified information regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts regulations on lobbying or similar activities regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting regulations pertaining to export control environmental laws employee wages pay and benefits and any other applicable laws or regulations for example we routinely provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters if a security breach were to occur our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective and we could face unknown risks or losses our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties cancellation of contracts loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if we fail to comply with federal state local or foreign governmental requirements our business may be adversely affected 

we are subject to us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business for example our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders which requires full compliance with both export regulatory laws and international trafficking in arms regulations “itar” although we have policies and procedures to comply with us and foreign international trade laws the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges or debarment from participation in us government contracts and could damage our reputation and our ability to do business 

page 26 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act of 2010 and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices despite our training and compliance programs there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions including contract cancellations or debarment and loss of reputation any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our international operations are exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies 

for fiscal 2019  approximately 29 of our revenue was earned from clients outside the us our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues our international operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

 the lack of a welldeveloped legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights in addition military action geopolitical shifts or continued unrest particularly in the middle east could impact the supply or pricing of oil disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere and increase our security costs to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic political and other conditions our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

page 27 

we work in international locations where there are high security risks which could result in harm to our employees or unanticipated cost 

some of our services are performed in highrisk locations where the country or location is subject to political social or economic risks or war terrorism or civil unrest in those locations where we have employees or operations we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel despite these activities in these locations we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel and we may suffer future losses of employees and subcontractors acts of terrorism and threats of armed conflicts in or around various areas in which we operate could limit or disrupt markets and our operations including disruptions resulting from the evacuation of personnel cancellation of contracts or the loss of key employees contractors or assets 

systems and information technology interruption or failure and data security or privacy breaches could adversely impact our ability to operate or expose us to significant financial losses and reputational harm 

we rely heavily on computer information and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business from time to time we experience occasional system interruptions and delays in the event we are unable to regularly deploy software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems the operation of such systems could be interrupted or result in the loss corruption or release of data in addition our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters force majeure events telecommunications failures power loss acts of war or terrorism computer viruses malicious code physical or electronic security breaches intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error or similar events or disruptions any of these or other events could cause interruptions delays loss of critical andor sensitive data or similar effects which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition protection of intellectual property and results of operations as well as those of our clients 

in addition we face the threat to our computer systems of unauthorized access computer hackers computer viruses malicious code ransomware phishing organized cyberattacks and other security problems and system disruptions including possible unauthorized access to and disclosure of our and our clients’ proprietary or classified information in addition such tactics may also seek to cause payments due to or from the company to be misdirected to fraudulent accounts which may not be recoverable by the company 

while we have security measures and technology in place to protect our and our clients’ proprietary or classified information if these measures fail as a result of a cyberattack other thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and someone obtains unauthorized access to our or our clients’ information our reputation could be damaged our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures as a result we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of system disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these disruptions and breaches any of these events could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition new laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information including the european union general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate costs and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties and legal liability 

we continuously evaluate the need to upgrade andor replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our computing environment to stay current on vendor supported products and to improve the efficiency of our systems and for other business reasons the implementation of new systems and information technology could adversely impact our operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems in addition our systems implementations may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated systems implementation disruption and any other information technology disruption if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have an adverse effect on our business 

page 28 

we are subject to professional standards duties and statutory obligations on professional reports and opinions we issue which could subject us to monetary damages 

we issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional engineering expertise as well as our other professional credentials that subject us to professional standards duties and obligations regulating the performance of our services for example we issue opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings if a client or another third party alleges that our report or opinion is incorrect or it is improperly relied upon and we are held responsible we could be subject to significant monetary damages in addition our reports and other work product may need to comply with professional standards licensing requirements securities regulations and other laws and rules governing the performance of professional services in the jurisdiction where the services are performed we could be liable to third parties who use or rely upon our reports and other work product even if we are not contractually bound to those third parties these events could in turn result in monetary damages and penalties 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or that of our clients 

our technology and intellectual property provide us in certain instances with a competitive advantage although we protect our property through registration licensing contractual arrangements security controls and similar mechanisms we may not be able to successfully preserve our rights and they could be invalidated circumvented challenged or become obsolete trade secrets are generally difficult to protect our employees and contractors are subject to confidentiality obligations but this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information andor infringement of our intellectual property in addition the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the us if we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights even if ultimately successful could be costly and could divert leadership’s attention away from other aspects of our business 

we also hold licenses from third parties which may be utilized in our business operations if we are no longer able to license such technology on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise our business and financial performance could be adversely affected 

if our intellectual property rights or work processes become obsolete we may not be able to differentiate our service offerings and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers our competitors may independently attempt to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies 

our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property there is a risk we may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and as a result could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities loss of contracts or other consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly or fall below the expectations of securities analysts which could have a material adverse impact on the price of our common stock fluctuations are caused by a number of factors including 



page 29 

 if we do not have adequate indemnification for our nuclear services it could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the priceanderson nuclear industries indemnity act commonly called the priceanderson act “paa” is a us federal law which among other things regulates radioactive materials and the nuclear energy industry including liability and compensation in the event of nuclear related incidents the paa provides certain protections and indemnification to nuclear energy plant operators and us department of energy “doe” contractors the paa protections and indemnification apply to us as part of our services to the us nuclear energy industry and doe for new facilities maintenance modification decontamination and decommissioning of nuclear energy weapons and research facilities 

we offer similar services in other jurisdictions outside the us for those jurisdictions varying levels of nuclear liability protection is provided by international treaties andor domestic laws such as the nuclear liability and compensation act of canada and the nuclear installations act of the united kingdom insurance andor assets of the nuclear installation operators some of which are backed by governments as well as under appropriate enforceable contractual indemnifications and holdharmless provisions these protections and indemnifications however may not cover all of our liability that could arise in the performance of these services to the extent the paa or other protections and indemnifications do not apply to our services the cost of losses associated with liability not covered by the available protections and indemnifications or by virtue of our loss of business because of these added costs could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements 

in preparing our financial statements our leadership is required under us gaap to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities areas requiring significant estimates by our leadership include 

 our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

page 30 

an impairment charge on our goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

because we have grown in part through acquisitions goodwill and intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets under us gaap we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach as of september 27 2019  we had 543 billion of goodwill representing 474 of our total assets of 1146 billion  we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the beginning of the fourth quarter of our fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business potential government actions toward our facilities and other factors 

if our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value we could be required to record an impairment charge the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing please see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 

there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends on our common stock 

our board of directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program in fiscal 2017 under which we have paid and intend to continue paying regular quarterly dividends the declaration amount and timing of such dividends are subject to capital availability and determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and applicable agreements our ability to pay dividends will depend upon among other factors our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions including acquisitions debt service requirements results of operations financial condition and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant a reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments andor our dividend program could have a material negative effect on our stock price 

we may be required to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and postretirement benefit plans we manage 

we have various employee benefit plan obligations that require us to make contributions to satisfy over time our underfunded benefit obligations which are generally determined by calculating the projected benefit obligations minus the fair value of plan assets for example as of september 27 2019 and september 28 2018  our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by 3998 million and 3393 million  respectively see note 12 pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k for additional disclosure in the future our benefit plan obligations may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of interest rates pension plan asset performance and other factors if we are required to contribute a significant amount of the deficit for underfunded benefit plans our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

page 31 

negotiations with labor unions and possible work actions could disrupt operations and increase labor costs and operating expenses 

a certain portion of our work force has entered into collective bargaining agreements which on occasion may require renegotiation the outcome of future negotiations relating to union representation or collective bargaining agreements may not be favorable to the company in that they may increase our operating expenses and lower our net income as a result of higher wages or benefit expenses in addition negotiations with unions could divert management attention and disrupt operations which may adversely affect our results of operations if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements we may have to address the threat of unioninitiated work actions including strikes depending on the nature of the threat or the type and duration of any work action these actions could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

demand for our services is cyclical as the sectors and industries in which our clients operate are impacted by economic downturns reductions in government or private spending and times of political uncertainty 

we provide full spectrum technical and professional solutions to clients operating in a number of sectors and industries including programs for various national governments including the us federal government aerospace automotive pharmaceuticals and biotechnology infrastructure environmental and nuclear buildings smart cities power water transportation telecom and other general industrial and consumer businesses and sectors these sectors and industries and the resulting demand for our services have been and we expect will continue to be cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control including economic conditions and changes in client spending particularly during periods of economic or political uncertainty 

uncertain global economic and political conditions may negatively impact our clients’ ability and willingness to fund their projects including their ability to raise capital and pay or timely pay our invoices they may also cause our clients to reduce their capital expenditures alter the mix of services purchased seek more favorable price and other contract terms and otherwise slow their spending on our services for example in the public sector declines in state and local tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending in addition under such conditions many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable these conditions may reduce the demand for our services which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally uncertain economic and political conditions may make it difficult for our clients our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities for example recent changes to us policies related to global trade and tariffs have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future of the global economy as well as retaliatory trade measures implemented by other countries the increasing cost of steel and aluminum may impact client spending we cannot predict the outcome of these changing trade policies or other unanticipated political conditions nor can we predict the timing strength or duration of any economic recovery or downturn worldwide or in our clients’ markets in addition our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and therefore may not recover as quickly as the economy at large weak economic conditions a failure to obtain expected benefits from any increased infrastructure spending or a reduction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore if a significant portion of our clients or projects are concentrated in a specific geographic area or industry our business may be disproportionately affected by negative trends or economic downturns in those specific geographic areas or industries 

regardless of economic or market conditions investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients’ markets and investment decisions as a result our past results have varied and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate

our operations may be impacted by the united kingdom’s proposed exit from the european union 

in june 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the uk’s exit from the eu there may be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the uk and eu countries and increased regulatory complexities these changes may adversely affect our relationships with our existing and future customers suppliers employees and subcontractors or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the ongoing negotiations between the uk and the eu as to the terms upon which the uk will exit from the eu and the uncertainty as to their future trade agreement continues to create economic uncertainty which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs terminate or reduce the scope of existing contracts decrease or postpone currently planned contracts or negotiate for more favorable deal terms each of which may have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on cash provided by operations and liquidity under our credit facilities to fund our business negative conditions in the credit and financial markets and delays in receiving client payments could adversely affect our cost of borrowing and our business 

although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions we are currently a borrower under several credit facilities these facilities all contain customary covenants restricting among other things our ability to incur certain liens and indebtedness we are also subject to certain financial covenants including maintenance of a maximum consolidated leverage ratio a breach of any covenant or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under one or more of our credit facilities and limit our ability to do further borrowing instability in the credit markets in the us or abroad could cause the availability of credit to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain at competitive rates on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts this situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds refinance our existing indebtedness enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all we may also enter into business acquisition agreements that require us to access credit which if not available at the closing of the acquisition could result in a breach of the acquisition agreement and a resulting claim for damages by the sellers of such business in addition market conditions could negatively impact our clients’ ability to fund their projects and therefore utilize our services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors suppliers and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements on less favorable terms with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

some of our customers suppliers and subcontractors depend on access to commercial financing and capital markets to fund their operations disruptions of the credit or capital markets could adversely affect our clients’ ability to finance projects and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions project delays and payment delays or defaults by our clients in addition clients may be unable to fund new projects may choose to make fewer capital expenditures or otherwise slow their spending on our services or to seek contract terms more favorable to them our government clients may face budget deficits that prohibit them from funding proposed and existing projects or that cause them to exercise their right to terminate our contracts with little or no prior notice in addition any financial difficulties suffered by our subcontractors or suppliers could increase our cost or adversely impact project schedules these disruptions could materially impact our backlog and have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are therefore subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices after we have already committed resources to their projects in weak economic environments we may experience increased delays and failures due to among other reasons our clients’ unwillingness to pay for alleged poor performance or to preserve their own working capital if one or more clients delays in paying or fails to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

page 33 

furthermore our cash balances and shortterm investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america europe south america australia and asia some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership or have been seized by their governments there is a risk that such events may occur in the future if any such events were to occur we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

maintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts 

in line with industry practice we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds or letters of credit to our customers these instruments indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract if a bond or a letter of credit is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond or letter of credit we cannot pursue that project historically we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity but as is typically the case the issuance of a bond is at the surety’s sole discretion and the issuance of a letter of credit is based on the companys creditworthiness because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms in addition future projects may require us to obtain letters of credit that extend beyond the term of our existing credit facilities our inability to obtain adequate bonding and as a result to bid on new contracts that require such bonding or letter of credit could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

rising inflation interest rates andor construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts in particular with respect to our fixedprice contracts 

rising inflation interest rates or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services in addition we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixedprice because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from costreimbursable type contracts approximately 76 during fiscal 2019  the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor however if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixedprice and lumpsum work is more prevalent inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future therefore increases in inflation interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects 

our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects both positive and negative that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar into the us dollar while we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in the currencies of our expenditures we do enter into contracts that expose us to currency risk particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs we attempt to minimize our exposure from currency risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies or entering into derivative hedging instruments when there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts these actions however may not always eliminate currency risk exposure the governments of certain countries have or may in the future impose restrictive exchange controls on local currencies and it may not be possible for us to engage in effective hedging transactions to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in a particular currency based on fluctuations in currency the us dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly we may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries 

page 34 

our effective tax rate may increase or decrease 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation the introduction of new tax accounting standards legislation regulations and related interpretations our global mix of earnings the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate or an ultimate determination that the company owes more taxes than the amounts previously accrued could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

we may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change 

growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations legislation international protocols regulation or other restrictions on emissions could result in increased compliance costs for us and our clients and have other impacts on our clients including those who are involved in the exploration production or refining of fossil fuels emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels or emit greenhouse gases through the mining manufacture utilization or production of materials or goods such policy changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or in some cases prevent a project from going forward thereby potentially reducing the need for our services which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations however these changes could also increase the pace of projects such as carbon capture or storage projects that could have a positive impact on our business we cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers 

our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control 

extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control such as natural or manmade disasters could negatively impact our ability to operate as an example from time to time we face unexpected severe weather conditions which may result in weatherrelated delays that are not always reimbursable under a fixedprice contract evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services increased labor and material costs in areas resulting from weatherrelated damage and subsequent increased demand for labor and materials for repairing and rebuilding inability to deliver materials equipment and personnel to job sites in accordance with contract schedules and loss of productivity we may remain obligated to perform our services after any such natural or manmade event unless a force majeure clause or other contractual provision provides us with relief from our contractual obligations if we are not able to react quickly to such events or if a high concentration of our projects are in a specific geographic region that suffers from a natural or manmade catastrophe our operations may be significantly affected which could have a material adverse impact on our operations in addition if we cannot complete our contracts on time we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients which may reduce our profits 

fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers’ investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation delays in existing work or changes in the timing and funding of new awards 

commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways for example for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil gas copper or fertilizers fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and therefore their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments furthermore declines in commodity prices can negatively impact our business in regions whose economies are substantially dependent on commodity prices such as the middle east to the extent commodity prices decline or fluctuate and our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects the demand for our services decreases which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned as well as those in progress and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

page 35 

our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel 

the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel including engineers architects designers craft personnel and corporate leadership professionals who have the required experience and expertise at a reasonable cost the market for these and other personnel is competitive from time to time it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients or to replace such personnel when needed in a timely manner in certain geographic areas for example we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel furthermore some of our personnel hold government granted clearance that may be required to obtain government projects if we were to lose some or all of these personnel they would be difficult to replace loss of the services of or failure to recruit qualified technical and leadership personnel could limit our ability to successfully complete existing projects and compete for new projects 

in addition in the event that any of our key personnel retire or otherwise leave the company we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans which requires devoting time and resources toward identifying and integrating new personnel into leadership roles and other key positions if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the cost of providing our services including the extent to which we utilize our workforce affects our profitability for example the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts if an expected contract award is delayed or not received we could incur costs resulting from excess staff reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties 

our business strategy involves growth through among other things the acquisition of other companies acquiring companies including ch2m hill companies ltd which we acquired in december 2017 and keyw which we acquired in june 2019 presents a number of risks including 



page 36 

 while we may obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses andor insurance that could mitigate certain of these risks such rights may be difficult to enforce the losses may exceed any dedicated escrow funds and the indemnitors may not have the ability to financially support the indemnity or the insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover all losses 

if our leadership is unable to successfully integrate acquired companies or implement our growth strategy our operating results could be harmed in addition even if the operations of an acquisition are integrated successfully we may not realize the full benefits of an acquisition including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all moreover we cannot assure that we will continue to successfully expand or that growth or expansion will result in profitability 

in addition there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us existing cash balances and cash flow from operations together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities may be insufficient to make acquisitions future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing which may not be available on attractive terms or at all acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 

acquisitions and divestitures create various business risks and uncertainties during the pendency of the transaction 

consummation of any merger or divestiture is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions including one or more of the following i due diligence and its associated time and cost commitments ii board and shareholder approval iii regulatory approvals iv the absence of any legal restraint that would prevent the consummation of the transaction v the absence of material adverse conditions which can prevent the consummation of the transaction and vi compliance with covenants and the accuracy of representations and warranties contained in the transaction agreement among others one or more of these conditions may not be fulfilled and accordingly the transaction may not be consummated or may be significantly delayed in such case our ongoing business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the market price of our common stock may decline particularly to the extent that the market price reflects a market assumption that the transaction will be consummated or will be consummated within a particular timeframe 

furthermore most transactions require the company to incur substantial expense associated with closing and if the transaction is not consummated we will incur these expenses without realizing the expected benefits the pursuit of the transaction will also require management attention and use of internal resources that would otherwise be focused on general business operations in addition customers’ uncertainty about the effect of the transaction may have an adverse effect on the ability to win customer contracts or could cause existing clients to seek to change existing business relationships employee morale due to the uncertainties associated with the transaction could also be negatively affected any of the foregoing or other risks arising in connection with a failure or delay in consummating a transaction including the diversion of management attention or loss of other opportunities during the pendency of the transaction could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make we could dilute share ownership and if we receive stock in connection with a divestiture the value of stock is subject to fluctuation 

one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities if we issue additional equity securities such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders’ individual ownership percentages in the company 

page 37 

in addition if we receive stock or other equity securities in connection with a sale or divestiture of a business the value of such stock will fluctuate andor be subject to trading restrictions stock price changes may result from among other things changes in the business operations or prospects of the issuer prior to or following the transaction litigation or regulatory considerations general business market industry or economic conditions the ability to sell all or a portion of the stock based on current market conditions and other factors both within and beyond the control of the company in addition if the stock received is valued in a currency other than us dollars the value of such stock will also fluctuate based on foreign currency rates for example in connection with the ecr sale the company received 582 million ordinary shares of worley as a portion of the purchase price approximately 513 million of such shares are subject to a lockup period that expires in december 2019 the value of such shares will fluctuate based on the trading price of the worley shares on the australian securities exchange and the exchange rate of the australian dollar 

we may be held liable to worley under the ecr sale agreement if we fail to perform certain services under the transition services agreement and the performance of such services may negatively impact our business and operations 

we have entered into a transition services agreement tsa with worley in connection with the sale of our ecr business pursuant to which we will provide worley on an interim transitional basis various services including but not limited to executive consultation services employee benefits administration human resources and payroll services tax services financial and accounting services information technology services regulatory services project management services for certain client contracts general administrative services and other support services if we do not satisfactorily perform our obligations under the agreement we may be required to reperform such services at no additional cost in addition during the transition services period our leadership and employees may be required to divert their attention away from our business in order to provide services to worley which could adversely affect our business 

delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control 

we are a delaware corporation certain antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us in addition certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover for example 

 these types of provisions as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders accordingly shareholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in order to better understand the changes that occur to key elements of our financial condition results of operations and cash flows a reader of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results 

page 43 

of operations “mda” should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business performing longterm professional services engineering and constructiontype contracts requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect both the entity’s results of operations and the carrying values of its assets and liabilities although our significant accounting policies are described in note 2  significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k the following discussion is intended to highlight and describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue accounting for contracts 

engineering procurement  construction contracts and service contracts 

on september 29 2018 the company adopted asc topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers including the subsequent asus that amended and clarified the related guidance the company recognizes engineering procurement and construction contract revenue over time as performance obligations are satisfied due to the continuous transfer of control to the customer upon adoption of asc topic 606 contracts which include engineering procurement and construction services are generally accounted for as a single deliverable a single performance obligation and are no longer segmented between types of services in some instances the company’s services associated with a construction activity are limited only to specific tasks such as customer support consulting or supervisory services in these instances the services are typically identified as separate performance obligations 

the company recognizes revenue using the percentageofcompletion method based primarily on contract costs incurred to date compared to total estimated contract costs estimated contract costs include the company’s latest estimates using judgments with respect to labor hours and costs materials and subcontractor costs the percentageofcompletion method an input method is the most representative depiction of the company’s performance because it directly measures the value of the services transferred to the customer subcontractor materials labor and equipment and in certain cases customerfurnished materials and labor and equipment are included in revenue and cost of revenue when management believes that the company is acting as a principal rather than as an agent eg the company integrates the materials labor and equipment into the deliverables promised to the customer or is otherwise primarily responsible for fulfillment and acceptability of the materials labor andor equipment the company recognizes revenue but not profit on certain uninstalled materials that are not specifically produced fabricated or constructed for a project revenue on these uninstalled materials is recognized when control is transferred changes to total estimated contract cost or losses if any are recognized in the period in which they are determined as assessed at the contract level precontract costs are expensed as incurred unless they are expected to be recovered from the client project mobilization costs are generally charged to project costs as incurred when they are an integrated part of the performance obligation being transferred to the client under the typical payment terms of our engineering procurement and construction contracts amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreedupon contractual terms at periodic intervals eg biweekly or monthly and customer payments on are typically due within 30 to 60 days of billing depending on the contract 

for service contracts the company recognizes revenue over time using the costtocost percentageofcompletion method service contracts that include multiple performance obligations are segmented between types of services for contracts with multiple performance obligations the company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation using an estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct service in the contract in some instances where the company is standing ready to provide services the company recognizes revenue ratably over the service period under the typical payment terms of our service contracts amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreedupon contractual terms and customer payments are typically due within 30 to 60 days of billing depending on the contract 

direct costs of contracts include all costs incurred in connection with and directly for the benefit of client contracts including depreciation and amortization relating to assets used in providing the services required by the related projects the level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors including the amount of passthrough costs we incur during a period on those projects where we are acting as principal for subcontract labor or thirdparty materials and equipment we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs and we refer to such costs as “passthrough costs” 

page 44 

variable consideration 

the nature of the company’s contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration including claims and unpriced change orders awards and incentive fees and liquidated damages and penalties the company recognizes revenue for variable consideration when it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur the company estimates the amount of revenue to be recognized on variable consideration using the expected value ie the sum of a probabilityweighted amount or the most likely amount method whichever is expected to better predict the amount factors considered in determining whether revenue associated with claims including change orders in dispute and unapproved change orders in regard to both scope and price should be recognized include the following a the contract or other evidence provides a legal basis for the claim b additional costs were caused by circumstances that were unforeseen at the contract date and not the result of deficiencies in the company’s performance c claimrelated costs are identifiable and considered reasonable in view of the work performed and d evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable if the requirements for recognizing revenue for claims or unapproved change orders are met revenue is recorded only when the costs associated with the claims or unapproved change orders have been incurred and only up to the amount of cost incurred back charges to suppliers or subcontractors are recognized as a reduction of cost when it is determined that recovery of such cost is probable and the amounts can be reliably estimated disputed back charges are recognized when the same requirements described above for claims accounting have been satisfied 

the company generally provides limited warranties for work performed under its engineering and construction contracts the warranty periods typically extend for a limited duration following substantial completion of the company’s work on the project historically warranty claims have not resulted in material costs incurred for which the company was not compensated for by the customer 

practical expedient 

if the company has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the company’s performance completed to date a service contract in which the company bills a fixed amount for each hour of service provided the company recognizes revenue in the amount to which it has a right to invoice for services performed 

the company does not adjust the contract price for the effects of a significant financing component if the company expects at contract inception that the period between when the company transfers a service to a customer and when the customer pays for that service will be one year or less 

joint ventures and vies 

as is common to the industry we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures although the joint ventures own and hold the contracts with the clients the services required by the contracts are typically performed by us and our joint venture partners or by other subcontractors under subcontracting agreements with the joint ventures many of these joint ventures are formed for a specific project the assets of our joint ventures generally consist almost entirely of cash and receivables representing amounts due from clients and the liabilities of our joint ventures generally consist almost entirely of amounts due to the joint venture partners for services provided by the partners to the joint ventures under their individual subcontracts and other subcontractors in general at any given time the equity of our joint ventures represents the undistributed profits earned on contracts the joint ventures hold with clients very few of our joint ventures have employees or thirdparty debt or credit facilities the debt held by the joint ventures is nonrecourse to the general credit of jacobs 

the assets of a joint venture are restricted for use to the obligations of the particular joint venture and are not available for general operations of the company our risk of loss on these arrangements is usually shared with our partners the liability of each partner is usually joint and several which means that each partner may become liable for the entire risk of loss on the project furthermore on some of our projects the company has granted guarantees which may encumber both our contracting subsidiary company and the company for the entire risk of loss on the project the company is unable to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under outstanding performance guarantees related to joint venture projects due to a number of factors including but not limited to the nature and extent of any contractual defaults by our joint venture partners resource availability potential performance delays caused by the defaults the location of the projects and the terms of the related contracts see note 17 contractual guarantees litigation investigations and insurance for further discussion 

page 45 

many of the joint ventures are deemed to be variable interest entities “vie” because they lack sufficient equity to finance the activities of the joint venture the company uses a qualitative approach to determine if the company is the primary beneficiary of the vie which considers factors that indicate a party has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the joint venture’s economic performance these factors include the composition of the governing board how board decisions are approved the powers granted to the operational managers and partner that holds that positions and to a certain extent the partner’s economic interest in the joint venture the company analyzes each joint venture initially to determine if it should be consolidated or unconsolidated 

 sharebased payments 

we measure the value of services received from employees and directors in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grantdate fair value of the award the computed value is recognized as a noncash cost on a straightline basis over the period the individual provides services which is typically the vesting period of the award with the exception of the value of awards containing an internal performance measure such as eps growth and roic which is recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period subject to the probability of meeting the performance requirements and adjusted for the number of shares expected to be earned

the accounting for pension plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans’ assets and liabilities these assumptions include discount rates investment returns and projected salary increases among others the actuarial assumptions used in determining the funded statuses of the plans are provided in note 12  pension and other postretirement benefit plans of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

the expected rates of return on plan assets range from 23 to 75 for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020  we believe the range of rates selected for fiscal 2019 reflects the longterm returns expected on the plans’ assets considering recent market conditions projected rates of inflation the diversification of the plans’ assets and the expected real rates of market returns the discount rates used to compute plan liabilities remained consistent year over year with a range of 13 to 81 in both fiscal 2018 and 2019  these assumptions represent the company’s best estimate of the rates at which its pension obligations could be effectively settled 

changes in the actuarial assumptions often have a material effect on the values assigned to plan assets and liabilities and the associated pension expense for example if the discount rate used to value the net pension benefit obligation “pbo” at september 27 2019 was higher by 05 the pbo would have been lower at that date by approximately 1976 million for nonus plans and by approximately 225 million for us plans if the expected return on plan assets was higher by 10 the net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2019 would be lower by approximately 190 million for nonus plans and by approximately 36 million for us plans differences between actuarial assumptions and actual performance ie actuarial gains and losses that are not recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost in the period in which such differences arise are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are recognized as part of net periodic pension cost in future periods in accordance with us gaap management monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in an effort to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used

contractual guarantees litigation investigations and insurance 

in the normal course of business we make contractual commitments some of which are supported by separate guarantees and on occasion we are a party in a litigation or arbitration proceeding the litigation in which we are involved primarily includes personal injury claims professional liability claims and breach of contract claims where we provide a separate guarantee it is strictly in support of the underlying contractual commitment guarantees take various forms including surety bonds required by law or standby letters of credit loc also referred to as “bank guarantees” or corporate guarantees given to induce a party to enter into a contract with a subsidiary standby locs are also used as security for advance payments or in various other transactions the guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from an arbitrary date to completion of our work eg engineering only to completion of the overall project we record in the consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such guarantees litigation and insurance claims guarantees are accounted for in accordance with asc 46010 guarantees  at fair value at the inception of the guarantee 

we maintain insurance coverage for most insurable aspects of our business and operations our insurance programs have varying coverage limits depending upon the type of insurance and include certain conditions and exclusions which insurance companies may raise in response to any claim that the company brings we have also elected to retain a portion of losses and liabilities that occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under our insurance programs as a result we may be subject to a future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured we intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of the contracts which the company enters with its clients our insurers are also subject to business risk and as a result one or more of them may be unable to fulfill their insurance obligations due to insolvency or otherwise 

additionally as a contractor providing services to the us federal government we are subject to many types of audits investigations and claims by or on behalf of the government including with respect to contract performance pricing cost allocations procurement practices labor practices and socioeconomic obligations furthermore our income franchise and similar tax returns and filings are also subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service most states within the united states as well as by various government agencies representing jurisdictions outside the united states 

our consolidated balance sheets include amounts representing our probable estimated liability relating to such claims guarantees litigation audits and investigations our estimates of probable liabilities require us to make assumptions related to potential losses regarding our determination of amounts considered probable and estimable we perform an analysis to determine the level of reserves to establish for insurancerelated claims that are known and have been asserted against us as well as for insurancerelated claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates we include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations insurance recoveries are recorded as assets if recovery is probable and estimated liabilities are not reduced by expected insurance recoveries 

the company believes after consultation with counsel that such guarantees litigation us government contractrelated audits investigations and claims and income tax audits and investigations should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements beyond amounts currently accrued 

testing goodwill for possible impairment 

the goodwill carried on our consolidated balance sheets is tested annually for possible impairment and on an interim basis if indicators of possible impairment exist for purposes of impairment testing goodwill is assigned to the applicable reporting units based on the current reporting structure in performing the annual impairment test we evaluate our goodwill at the reporting unit level the company performs the annual goodwill impairment test for the reporting units at the beginning of the fourth quarter of its fiscal year 

us gaap does not prescribe a specific valuation method for estimating the fair value of reporting units any valuation technique used to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including revenue growth rates operating margins discount rates and future market conditions among others 

page 47 

we used an income approach to test our goodwill for possible impairment which requires us to make estimates and judgments under the income approach fair value is determined by using the discounted cash flows of our reporting units the company’s discount rate reflects a weighted average cost of capital “wacc” for a peer group of companies representative of the company’s respective reporting units 

it is possible that changes in market conditions economy facts and circumstances judgments and assumptions used in estimating the fair value could change resulting in possible impairment of goodwill in the future the fair values resulting from the valuation techniques used are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of the reporting units to willing third parties 

we have determined that the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values for the consolidated balance sheets presented

restructuring and other charges 

for discussion regarding restructuring and other charges see note 9 restructuring and other charges to the consolidated financial statements 

backlog information 

we include in backlog the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us our policy with respect to om contracts however is to include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for one succeeding year regardless of the remaining life of the contract for national government programs other than national government om contracts which are subject to the same policy applicable to all other om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding option periods because of variations in the nature size expected duration funding commitments and the scope of services required by our contracts the timing of when backlog will be recognized as revenues can vary greatly between individual contracts 

page 57 

consistent with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the option of the client including our us government work while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog at any given time our backlog is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein backlog is not necessarily an indicator of future revenues 

certain contracts eg contracts relating to large epc projects as well as national government programs can cause large increases to backlog in the fiscal period in which we recognize the award and because many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years 

please refer to item 1a risk factors  above for a discussion of other factors that may cause backlog to ultimately convert into revenues at different amounts 

the following table summarizes our backlog for the years ended september 27 2019  september 28 2018 and september 29 2017 in millions 



the increase in backlog in critical mission solutions for the years presented were primarily the result of new awards from the us federal government and the keyw acquisition in fiscal year 2019 

the increase in backlog in people  places solutions for the years presented were primarily the result of new awards in australia and the us in addition to the ch2m acquisition in fiscal 2018 

backlog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies totaled approximately 88 billion or 391  of total backlog 68 billion or 341  of total backlog and 46 billion or 349  of total backlog at september 27 2019  september 28 2018 and september 29 2017  respectively most of our federal government contracts require that services be provided beyond one year in general these contracts must be funded annually ie the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the us congress to the procuring agency and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts 

we estimate that approximately 866 billion  or 384  of total backlog at september 27 2019 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year 

consolidated backlog differs from the company’s remaining performance obligations as defined by asc 606 primarily because of our national government contracts other than national government om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding the option periods while our remaining performance obligations represent a measure of the total dollar value of work to be performed on contracts awarded and in progress additionally the company includes our proportionate share of backlog related to unconsolidated joint ventures which is not included in our remaining performance obligations 

liquidity and capital resources 

at september 27 2019  our principal sources of liquidity consisted of  6311 million in cash and cash equivalents 194 billion of available borrowing capacity under our 225 billion restated revolving credit agreement the new credit agreement and cash flows from operating activities additional information regarding the new credit agreement is set forth in note 10  borrowings in notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10k we finance much of our operations and growth through cash generated by our operations 

at september 27 2019  our cash and cash equivalents were 6311 million  a decrease of  38 million from 6349 million at september 28 2018  this decrease was due to cash flows provided by investing activities of 22 billion and exchange rate effects on cash of 208 million  offset by unfavorable cash flows from financing activities of 20 billion and cash used for operations of 3664 million  

page 58 

our cash flow used for operations of 3664 million during fiscal 2019 was comparatively lower than the 4812 million in cash flow from operations for the corresponding period in fiscal 2018  due primarily to higher uses of cash in working capital including cash paid for taxes relating to the ecr sale compared to the previous period offset in part by higher net earnings after add back of noncash adjustments including those related to the ecr sale compared to the prior period also the current fiscal year included acquisition costs related to keyw and the prior fiscal year included acquisition costs incurred in connection with the ch2m acquisition 

our cash provided by investing activities for fiscal 2019 of 22 billion was comparatively higher than the 16 billion cash used in investing activities for the corresponding period in fiscal 2018  the change is primarily attributable to cash provided by the ecr sale offset slightly by the cash used for the keyw acquisition in the current year and cash used for the ch2m acquisition in the prior year also additions to property and equipment increased from the comparative period and in the current period we received 647 million in proceeds from the sale of a portion of our worley stock investment 

our cash used for financing activities of 20 billion in fiscal 2019 resulted mainly from net repayments of borrowings of 10 billion  primarily related to repayments with cash received from the ecr sale and common stock repurchases of 8537 million  cash provided by financing activities was 114 billion for the prior fiscal year provided mainly from the proceeds on borrowings to fund the ch2m acquisition additionally the company paid 1064 million in dividends to shareholders and noncontrolling interests during the current fiscal year compared to 866 million in dividends paid in the prior fiscal year period 

at september 27 2019  the company had approximately 2249 million in cash and cash equivalents held in the us and 4062 million held outside of the us primarily in the uk the eurozone australia india and the united arab emirates which is used primarily for funding operations in those regions other than the tax cost of repatriating funds to the us see note 15 income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k there are no material impediments to repatriating these funds to the us 

the company had 2622 million in letters of credit outstanding at september 27 2019  of this amount 23 million was issued under the new credit agreement and 2599 million was issued under separate committed and uncommitted letterofcredit facilities

controls and procedures 

tableend evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

the company’s management with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined by rule 13a15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of september 27 2019  the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k the “evaluation date” based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the exchange act were functioning effectively as of the evaluation date to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the company in reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

as permitted by sec guidance for newly acquired businesses management’s assessment of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures did not include an assessment of those disclosure controls and procedures of keyw that are subsumed by internal control over financial reporting keyw accounted for approximately 9 of total assets as of september 27 2019  and 1 of revenues for the fiscal year ended on september 27 2019  

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining for the company adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act management with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the evaluation date based on the framework established in “internal control—integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework based on this assessment management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the evaluation date was effective as permitted by sec guidance for newly acquired businesses management’s assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting did not include an assessment of internal control over financial reporting of keyw keyw accounted for approximately 9 of total assets as of september 27 2019  and 1 of revenues for the fiscal year ended on september 27 2019  

the companys independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp that audited the companys consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 27 2019  as stated in their report included in this annual report on form 10k 

page 62 

remediation of previously identified material weakness 

in the companys fiscal 2018 form 10k management previously identified the following material weakness as of september 28 2018 a material weakness related to internal control deficiencies over the accounting for income taxes in connection with a business combination specifically related to the ineffective design and operating effectiveness of controls over the completeness and accuracy of deferred taxes and the evaluation of the recoverability of deferred taxes associated with the ch2m acquisition the material weakness did not result in any material misstatements to the company’s previously issued financial statements nor in the financial statements included in this form 10k 

the companys management is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment in response to the identified material weakness management with the oversight of the audit committee of the board of directors took comprehensive actions to remediate the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting including implementing additional specific enhanced control procedures for the review analysis and reporting of its deferred income tax accounts including control procedures relating to the recoverability of deferred taxes associated with acquired businesses in a business combination the company has successfully completed the remediation efforts with the completion of the keyw acquisition the remediation efforts both addressed the identified material weakness and also enhanced our overall financial control environment 

changes in internal control 

other than the changes resulting from the remediation activities described above there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the company’s fiscal quarter ended september 27 2019 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

limitations on effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its system of internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed or operated can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of internal control are met the design of the company’s control system reflects the fact that there are resource constraints and that the benefits of such control systems must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control failures and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the intentional acts of individuals by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that the design of any particular control will always succeed in achieving its objective under all potential future conditions

the company’s strategy 

our strategy is based on three key priorities 

 employees and safety 

our employees are our most important and valuable asset the prevention of jobrelated injuries is given top priority it is the policy of the company to provide and maintain a safe and healthy working environment and to follow operating practices that safeguard all employees and result in a more efficient operation beyondzero® is the name of the global program that promotes our culture of caring and goes beyond efforts to have an incident and injuryfree safety performance we implement a culture of caring where concern for employees health safety and welfare extends outside the office beyond the project site fences and into their homes cars and all the places where they interact with family friends and fellow employees we also have a mental health program that aims to promote positive mental health across our company 

we strive to present a clear and consistent image of our company to our clients employees shareholders and business partners regarding how we behave how we communicate how we look and most importantly how our promises to our clients are delivered anywhere in the world 

we accomplish this foremost through our vision mission and values which allow us to behave as one company and unify us worldwide by keeping our values as a central focus of our company we are able to think the same way and arrive at similar conclusions regardless of our physical location with respect to our values 

• our values stand on a foundation of safety and integrity 

• people are the heart of our business 

• clients are our valued partners 

• performance excellence is our commitment and 

• profitable growth is an imperative 

our vision statement “providing solutions for a more connected sustainable world” underpins our commitment to sustainability plan beyond is how we define and identify our approach to sustainability building on beyondzero and our culture of caring plan beyond helps us to focus on looking beyond our company and how we contribute as a global corporate citizen our sustainability activities encompass stakeholders at jacobs including our clients our people and wider communities our supply chain partners and our investors our people are empowered to explore to innovate and to develop solutions that help our clients deliver their sustainability goals we have the experience and competency to assist our clients with the challenges of climate change resilience of cities and infrastructure efficient procurement resource reuse and recycling water resource management energy source management and environmental protection and enhancement

growth strategy 

jacobs has grown significantly since its founding in 1947 both organic growth and strategic acquisitions play an important part of the company’s growth strategy we have acquired and integrated numerous companies over the years that have enhanced our capabilities geographic reach and offerings 

in terms of organic growth our relationshipbased business model is central to our sustained growth and profitability we pursue the development of longterm relationships and alliances with our clients by working with our clients to solve their challenges we increase our understanding of their overall business needs as well as the unique technical requirements of their specific projects this increased understanding enables us to provide superior value to our clients our approach provides us with opportunities to market the following services to our clients 

 our relationships with clients also present ongoing opportunities to expand into adjacent sectors for example clients operating in the mining and minerals market often have a need for our infrastructure and buildings capabilities the same is true for clients operating in other sectors 

we market our services to clients in a wide range of public institutional process and industrial sectors we are able to price contracts competitively and enhance overall profitability while delivering additional value to our clients by integrating and bundling our services and providing differentiated solutions in complex economic times we believe we have the ability to evolve along with industry cycles worldwide when opportunities decrease in a particular sector or geography other opportunities often increase because of our focused industry diversity we believe we are well positioned to address a wide range of opportunities across many sectors and geographies which helps us grow our business 

the role of strategic transactions in the development of our business 

jacobs pursues acquisitions divestitures and other transactions to drive longterm value and profitable growth by positioning us in the most attractive sectors and geographies when we review acquisition targets we are conscious of the effect the acquisition may have on our client base we favor acquisitions that are aligned with our growth strategy which target enhancements of our capabilities and add value to our customers and shareholders we do this by i expanding into a new client sector ii enhancing the range of services we provide existing clients andor iii accessing new geographic areas in which our clients either already operate or plan to expand by expanding into new geographic areas and adding to our existing technical and project management capabilities we strive to position ourselves as a preferred singlesource provider of technical professional and construction services to our clients 

see the following brief description of some of our recent key acquisitions 

page 6 

 in line with our strategy of driving longterm value and profitable growth on october 21 2018 jacobs and worleyparsons limited a company incorporated in australia “buyer” entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement pursuant to which buyer agreed to acquire the company’s energy chemicals and resource business the ecr business for an aggregate purchase price of 33 billion the transaction is expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2019 

for additional information regarding certain issues related to our acquisition strategy please refer to item 1a risk factors  below 

lines of business 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 we reorganized our operating and reporting structure around three global lines of business “lobs” which also serve as the company’s operating segments i aerospace technology environmental and nuclear ii buildings infrastructure and advanced facilities and iii energy chemicals and resources this reorganization occurred in conjunction with the integration of ch2m into the companys legacy businesses and was intended to better serve our global clients leverage our workforce help streamline operations and provide enhanced growth opportunities the company’s lob leadership and internal reporting structures report to the chief executive officer who is also the chief operating decision maker “codm” and enable the codm to evaluate the performance of each of these segments and make appropriate resource allocations among each of the segments the sales function is managed on an lob basis and accordingly the associated cost is embedded in the new segments and reported to the respective lob presidents in addition a portion of the costs of other support functions eg finance legal human resources and information technology is allocated to each lob using methodologies which we believe effectively attribute the cost of these support functions to the revenue generating activities of the company on a rational basis the cost of the company’s cash incentive plan the management incentive plan “mip” and the expense associated with the jacobs engineering group inc 1999 stock incentive plan “1999 sip” have likewise been charged to the lobs except for those amounts determined to relate to the business as a whole which amounts remain in other corporate expenses

we include in backlog the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us our policy with respect to om contracts however is to include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for one succeeding year regardless of the remaining life of the contract for national government programs other than national government om contracts which are subject to the same policy applicable to all other om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding option periods because of variations in the nature size expected duration funding commitments and the scope of services required by our contracts the timing of when backlog will be recognized as revenues can vary greatly between individual contracts 

consistent with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the option of the client including our us government work while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog at any given time our backlog is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein backlog is not necessarily an indicator of future revenues 

because certain contracts eg contracts relating to large epc projects as well as national government programs can cause large increases to backlog in the fiscal period in which we recognize the award and because many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years we evaluate our backlog on a yearoveryear basis rather than on a sequential quarteroverquarter basis 

the following table summarizes our backlog for the years ended september 28 2018  september 29 2017  and september 30 2016  in millions 



for additional information regarding our backlog including those risk factors specific to backlog please refer to item 1a  risk factors and item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below subject to the factors discussed in item 1a  risk factors we estimate that approximately  10  billion or 36  of total backlog at september 28 2018  will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year 

significant customers 

the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government for each of the last five fiscal years 



page 10 

given the percentage of total revenue derived directly from the us federal government the loss of us federal government agencies as customers would have a material adverse effect on the company in addition any or all of our government contracts could be terminated we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work or payment of our costs could be disallowed approximately 94  of revenue derived directly from the us federal government is in the aten segment for more information on risks relating to our government contracts see item 1a  risk factors 

financial information about geographic areas 

selected financial information regarding the geographic areas in which we operate is included in note 17  segment information  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k and is incorporated herein by reference for fiscal 2018  approximately 36  of our revenues were earned from clients outside the united states our international operations are subject to a variety of risks which are described under item 1a  risk factors  below 

contracts 

while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake our contracts generally fall into two broad categories costreimbursable and fixedprice the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the last five fiscal years 



in accordance with industry practice most of our contracts including those with the us federal government are subject to termination at the discretion of the client which is discussed in greater detail in item 1a  risk factors  in such situations our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination 

when we are directly responsible for engineering design procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client’s plant or facility we reflect the costs of materials equipment and subcontracts in both revenues and costs the following table sets forth the approximate amount of such passthrough costs included in revenues for each of the last five fiscal years in millions of dollars 



on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs 

costreimbursable contracts 

costreimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit the profit element may be in the form of a simple markup applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee or a combination of a markup and a fee the fee element can also take several forms the fee may be a fixed amount it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred or it may be an incentive fee based on targets milestones or performance factors defined in the contract in general we prefer costreimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price 

fixedprice contracts 

fixedprice contracts include both “lump sum bid” contracts and “negotiated fixedprice” contracts under lump sum bid contracts we typically bid against other contractors based on clientfurnished specifications this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period additionally it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients which is contrary to our relationshipbased business model accordingly lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract and as such the company has rarely entered into individual lump sum bid contracts that are material to its financial results in contrast under a negotiated fixedprice contract we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client negotiated fixedprice contracts frequently exist in singleresponsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project thus 

page 11 

although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us however because of economies that may be realized during the contract term both negotiated fixedprice and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts the company carefully manages the risk inherent in these types of contracts in recent years most of our fixedprice work has been either negotiated fixedprice contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services rather than turnkey construction 

competition 

we compete with a large number of companies across the world typically no single company or companies dominate the market in which we provide services we compete based on the following factors among others price of services technical capabilities reputation for quality safety record availability of qualified personnel ability to timely perform work and willingness to accept projectrelated risk for more information regarding the competitive conditions in our business please refer to item 1a  risk factors  below 

employees 

at september 28 2018  we had approximately 74400 fulltime staff employees including contract staff additionally as of september 28 2018  there were approximately 6400 persons employed in the field on a project basis the number of field employees varies in relation to the number and size of the maintenance and construction projects in progress at any particular time

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend we operate in a changing global environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future we may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial if any such events actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces if we the owner or others working at the project site fail to maintain safe work sites we can be exposed to significant financial losses and reputational harm as well as civil and criminal liabilities 

construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment moving vehicles chemical and manufacturing processes and highly regulated materials in a challenging environment and often in geographically remote locations if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective or if others working at the site fail to implement and follow appropriate safety procedures our employees and others may become injured disabled or even lose their lives the completion or commencement of our projects may be delayed and we may be exposed to litigation or investigations unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover increase the cost of a project to our clients and raise our operating and insurance costs any of the foregoing could result in financial losses or reputational harm which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials which if improperly handled or disposed of could subject us to civil andor criminal liabilities we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health safety and environmental “hse” work procedures throughout our organization including construction sites and 

page 13 

maintenance sites the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability in addition despite the work of our functional groups we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel or that there will be no damage to or loss of our work equipment or supplies 

our safety record is critical to our reputation many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures accordingly if we fail to maintain adequate safety standards we could suffer reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

demand for our services is cyclical as the sectors and industries in which our clients operate are impacted by economic downturns reductions in government or private spending and times of political uncertainty 

we provide technical professional construction and om services to clients operating in a number of sectors and industries including oil and gas exploration production and refining programs for various national governments including the us federal government chemicals and polymers mining and minerals pharmaceuticals and biotechnology infrastructure buildings power water transportation and other general industrial and consumer businesses and markets such as technology and manufacturing pulp and paper and food and consumer products these sectors and industries and the resulting demand for our services have been and we expect will continue to be cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control including economic conditions and changes in client spending particularly during periods of economic or political uncertainty 

uncertain global economic and political conditions may negatively impact our clients’ ability and willingness to fund their projects including their ability to raise capital and pay or timely pay our invoices they may also cause our clients to reduce their capital expenditures alter the mix of services purchased seek more favorable price and other contract terms and otherwise slow their spending on our services for example in the public sector declines in state and local tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending in addition under such conditions many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable these conditions may reduce the demand for our services which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

additionally uncertain economic and political conditions may make it difficult for our clients our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities for example recent changes to us policies related to global trade and tariffs have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future of the global economy as well as retaliatory trade measures implemented by other countries the increasing cost of steel and aluminum may impact client spending we cannot predict the outcome of these changing trade policies or other unanticipated political conditions nor can we predict the timing strength or duration of any economic recovery or downturn worldwide or in our clients’ markets in addition our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and therefore may not recover as quickly as the economy at large weak economic conditions a failure to obtain expected benefits from any increased infrastructure spending or a reduction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore if a significant portion of our clients or projects are concentrated in a specific geographic area or industry our business may be disproportionately affected by negative trends or economic downturns in those specific geographic areas or industries 

regardless of economic or market conditions investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients’ markets and investment decisions as a result our past results have varied and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate 

fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers’ investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation delays in existing work or changes in the timing and funding of new awards 

commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways for example for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil gas copper or fertilizers fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and therefore their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments furthermore declines in commodity prices can negatively impact our business in regions whose economies are substantially dependent on commodity prices such as the middle east to the extent commodity prices decline or fluctuate and our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects the demand for our services decreases which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

page 14 

commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned as well as those in progress and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our project execution activities may result in liability for faulty services 

if we fail to provide our services in accordance with applicable professional standards or contractual requirements we could be exposed to significant monetary damages or even criminal violations our engineering practice for example involves professional judgments regarding the planning design development construction operations and management of industrial facilities and public infrastructure projects while we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages in our contracts and although we have adopted a range of insurance risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities a catastrophic event at one of our project sites or completed projects resulting from the services we have performed could result in significant professional or product liability and warranty or other claims against us as well as reputational harm especially if public safety is impacted these liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or the fees we generate may not be covered by insurance at all due to various exclusions in our coverage and could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future further even where coverage applies the policies have deductibles which result in our assumption of exposure for certain amounts with respect to any claim filed against us in addition clients or subcontractors who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us an uninsured claim either in part or in whole as well as any claim covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible if successful and of a material magnitude could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel 

the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel including engineers architects designers craft personnel and corporate management professionals who have the required experience and expertise at a reasonable cost the market for these and other personnel is competitive from time to time it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients or to replace such personnel when needed in a timely manner in certain geographic areas for example we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel furthermore some of our personnel hold government granted clearance that may be required to obtain government projects if we were to lose some or all of these personnel they would be difficult to replace loss of the services of or failure to recruit qualified technical and management personnel could limit our ability to successfully complete existing projects and compete for new projects 

in addition in the event that any of our key personnel retire or otherwise leave the company we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans which requires devoting time and resources toward identifying and integrating new personnel into leadership roles and other key positions if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the cost of providing our services including the extent to which we utilize our workforce affects our profitability for example the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts if an expected contract award is delayed or not received we could incur costs resulting from excess staff reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business financial conditions and results of operations 

if we do not have adequate indemnification for our nuclear services it could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

the priceanderson nuclear industries indemnity act commonly called the priceanderson act “paa” is a us federal law which among other things regulates radioactive materials and the nuclear energy industry including liability and compensation in the event of nuclear related incidents the paa provides certain protections and indemnification to nuclear energy plant operators and us department of energy “doe” contractors the paa protections and indemnification apply to us as part of our services to the us nuclear energy industry and doe for new facilities maintenance modification decontamination and decommissioning of nuclear energy weapons and research facilities 

we offer similar services in other jurisdictions outside the us for those jurisdictions varying levels of nuclear liability protection is provided by international treaties andor domestic laws such as the nuclear liability and compensation act of canada and the nuclear installations act of the united kingdom insurance andor assets of the nuclear installation operators 

page 15 

some of which are backed by governments as well as under appropriate enforceable contractual indemnifications and holdharmless provisions these protections and indemnifications however may not cover all of our liability that could arise in the performance of these services to the extent the paa or other protections and indemnifications do not apply to our services our business could be adversely affected because of the cost of losses associated with liability not covered by the available protections and indemnifications or by virtue of our loss of business because of these added costs 

we engage in a highly competitive business if we are unable to compete effectively we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

we face intense competition to provide technical professional and construction services to clients the markets we serve are highly competitive and we compete against a large number of regional national and multinational companies 

the extent and type of our competition varies by industry geographic area and project type for example with respect to our construction operations and maintenance services clients generally award large projects to large contractors which may give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects conversely with respect to our engineering design architectural and consulting services low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller newer competitors 

our projects are frequently awarded through a competitive bidding process which is standard in our industry we are constantly competing for project awards based on pricing schedule and the breadth and technical sophistication of our services competition can place downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins which may force us to accept contractual terms and conditions that are less favorable to us thereby increasing the risk that among other things we may not realize profit margins at the same rates as we have seen in the past or may become responsible for costs or other liabilities we have not accepted in the past if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both which if significant could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the performance of these contracts 

our revenues are derived from new contract awards delays in the timing of the awards or cancellations of such projects as a result of economic conditions material and equipment pricing and availability or other factors could impact our longterm projected results it is particularly difficult to predict whether or when we will receive largescale projects as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process which is affected by a number of factors such as market conditions or governmental and environmental approvals since a significant portion of our revenues is generated from such projects our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards and the commencement or progress of work under awarded contracts furthermore many of these contracts are subject to financing contingencies and as a result we are subject to the risk that the customer will not be able to secure the necessary financing for the project 

in addition many of our contracts require us to satisfy specific progress or performance milestones in order to receive payment from the customer as a result we may incur significant costs for engineering materials components equipment labor or subcontractors prior to receipt of payment from a customer 

the uncertainty of our contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs in some cases we maintain and bear the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than necessary under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards if an expected contract award is delayed or not received we may incur additional costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are a party to claims and litigation in the normal course of business since we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities and projects where design construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or others we are exposed to substantial claims and litigation and investigations if there is a failure at any such facility or project such claims could relate to among other things personal injury loss of life business interruption property damage pollution and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties such as those who use or reside near our clients’ projects we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met in many of our contracts with clients subcontractors and vendors we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages penalties losses and other exposures relating to projects 

page 16 

that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts in addition while clients and subcontractors may agree to indemnify us against certain liabilities such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us 

with a workforce of approximately 80000 people globally we are also party to labor and employment claims in the normal course of business such claims could relate to allegations of harassment and discrimination pay equity denial of benefits wage and hour violations whistleblower protections concerted protected activity and other employment protections and may be pursued on an individual or class action basis depending on applicable laws and regulations some of such claims may be insurable while other such claims may not 

we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations our insurance programs have varying coverage limits as well as exclusions for matters such as fraud and insurance companies may attempt to deny claims for which we seek coverage in addition we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles retentions and limits under these programs as a result we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured 

although in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future or that such insurance can be economically secured for example catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits coverage that is more limited or increased premium costs or higher deductibles we monitor the financial health of the insurance companies from which we procure insurance which is one of the factors we take into account when purchasing insurance our insurance is purchased from a number of the worlds leading providers often in layered insurance or quota share arrangements if any of our third party insurers fail abruptly cancel our coverage or otherwise cannot satisfy their insurance requirements to us then our overall risk exposure and operational expenses could be increased and our business operations could be interrupted 

in addition the nature of our business sometimes results in clients subcontractors and vendors presenting claims to us for among other things recovery of costs related to certain projects similarly we occasionally present change orders and claims to our clients subcontractors and vendors for among other things additional costs exceeding the original contract price if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients subcontractors and vendors we could incur cost overruns reduced profits or in some cases a loss for a project further these claims can be the subject of lengthy negotiations arbitration or litigation proceedings which could result in the investment of significant amounts of working capital pending the resolution of the relevant change orders and claims a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results additionally irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant 

litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability product liability criminal liability warranty obligations default under our credit agreements and other liabilities which to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the nature of our contracts particularly those that are fixedprice subjects us to risks of cost overruns we may experience reduced profits or in some cases losses if costs increase above budgets or estimates or if the project experiences schedule delays 

for fiscal 2018  approximately 24  of our revenues were earned under fixedprice contracts both fixedprice and many cost reimbursable contracts require us to estimate the total cost of the project in advance of our performance for fixedprice contracts we may benefit from any costsavings but we bear greater risk of paying some if not all of any cost overruns fixedprice contracts are established in part on partial or incomplete designs cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions including those about future economic conditions commodity and other materials pricing and availability of labor equipment and materials and other exigencies if the design or the estimates prove inaccurate or if circumstances change due to among other things unanticipated technical problems difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals changes in local laws or labor conditions weather or other delays beyond our control changes in the costs of equipment or raw materials our vendors’ or subcontractors’ inability or failure to perform or changes in general economic conditions then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or in some cases a loss for that project these risks are exacerbated for projects with longterm durations because there is an increased risk that the circumstances on which we based our original estimates will change in a manner that increases costs if the project is significant or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

page 17 

our contracts that are fundamentally cost reimbursable in nature may also present a risk to the extent the final cost on a project exceeds the amount the customer expected or budgeted like fixedprice contracts the expected cost of costreimbursable projects are based in part on partial design and our estimates of the resources and time necessary to perform such contracts a portion of the fee is often linked to these estimates and the related final cost and schedule objectives and if for whatever reason these objectives are not met the project may be less profitable than we expect or even result in losses 

the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted canceled or suspended by our clients and therefore our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings additionally even if fully performed our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins 

backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us as of the end of fiscal 2018  our backlog totaled approximately 273 billion  there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or if realized will result in profits in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation termination or suspension at the discretion of the client including our us government work in the event of a project cancellation we would generally have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project the risk of contracts in backlog being canceled or suspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns or in response to changes in commodity prices 

the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts the revenue for certain contracts included in backlog is based on estimates additionally the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence future profitability 

in some markets there is a continuing trend towards costreimbursable contracts with incentivefee arrangements typically our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs overall safety performance overall client satisfaction and other performance criteria if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards we may receive a lower or even zero incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins accordingly there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog assuming they produce the revenues currently expected will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies which are a significant source of our revenue and profit are subject to various uncertainties restrictions and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities as well as profit and cost controls which could result in withholding or delay of payments to us government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding such as sequestration and budget deficits contracts with the us federal government for example are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for government programs may even be eliminated legislatures typically appropriate funds on a yearbyyear basis while contract performance may take more than one year as a result contracts with government agencies may be only partially funded or may be terminated and we may not realize all of the potential revenue and profit from those contracts 

our government clients may reduce the scope of or terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues for example those with the us federal government represented approximately 23  of our total revenue in fiscal 2018  a significant reduction in government funding or the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

most government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process the us federal government has increasingly relied upon multipleyear contracts with multiple contractors that generally require those contractors to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under a contract this process may result in us facing significant additional pricing pressure and uncertainty and incurring additional costs moreover we may not be awarded government contracts because of existing policies designed to protect small businesses and underrepresented minorities our inability to win new contracts or be awarded work under existing contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

page 18 

in addition government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socioeconomic requirements which affect how we transact business with our clients and in some instances impose additional costs on our business operations for example for contracts with the us federal government we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation the truth in negotiations act the cost accounting standards and numerous regulations governing environmental protection and employment practices government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than nongovernment contracts this includes for example unlimited indemnification obligations 

we also are subject to government audits investigations and proceedings for example government agencies such as the us defense contract audit agency routinely review and audit us to determine the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies and whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations these audits can result in a determination that a rule or regulation has been violated or that adjustments are necessary to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies 

if we violate a rule or regulation fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit a variety of penalties can be imposed on us including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties for example in socalled “qui tam” actions brought by individuals or the government under the us federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws treble damages can be awarded in addition any or all of our government contracts could be terminated we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work or payment of our costs could be disallowed the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances which can be difficult and time consuming to obtain if our employees or our facilities are unable to obtain or retain the necessary security clearances our clients could terminate or not renew existing contracts or award us new contracts which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control 

as is common in our industry we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures partnerships and similar arrangements this situation exposes us to a number of risks including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients 

further we have limited ability to control the actions of our joint venture partners including with respect to nonperformance default bankruptcy or legal or regulatory compliance our partners may be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships if these circumstances occur we may be liable for claims and losses attributable to the partner by operation of law or contract these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend on the management effectiveness of our joint venture partners differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major issues which could materially affect the business and operations of these ventures in addition in many of the countries in which we engage in joint ventures it may be difficult to enforce our contractual rights under the applicable joint venture agreement if we are not able to enforce our contractual rights we may not be able to realize the benefits of the joint venture or we may be subject to additional liabilities 

we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner in these cases we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the failure by a joint venture partner to comply with applicable laws regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and for government clients could result in fines penalties suspension or even debarment being imposed on us which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts 

thirdparty subcontractors we hire perform much of the work performed under our contracts we also rely on thirdparty equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects if we are unable to hire 

page 19 

qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired if we are not able to locate qualified thirdparty subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated especially in a lump sum or a fixedprice contract we may suffer losses on these contracts if a subcontractor supplier or manufacturer fails to provide services supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason we may be required to source these services equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms which could impact contract profitability there is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors relating to among other things the quality and timeliness of work performed customer concerns about the subcontractor or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a contract in addition faulty workmanship equipment or materials could impact the overall project resulting in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications 

in an uncertain or downturn economic environment third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party’s ability to provide materials equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a failure by a third party subcontractor supplier or manufacturer to comply with applicable laws regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and for government clients could result in fines penalties suspension or even debarment being imposed on us which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

negative conditions in the credit and financial markets and delays in receiving client payments could result in liquidity problems adversely affecting our cost of borrowing and our business 

although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions instability in the credit markets in the us or abroad could cause the availability of credit to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain at competitive rates on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts this situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds refinance our existing indebtedness enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all we may also enter into business acquisition agreements that require us to access credit which if not available at the closing of the acquisition could result in a breach of the acquisition agreement and a resulting claim for damages by the sellers of such business in addition market conditions could negatively impact our clients’ ability to fund their projects and therefore utilize our services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors suppliers and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements on less favorable terms with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

some of our customers suppliers and subcontractors depend on access to commercial financing and capital markets to fund their operations disruptions of the credit or capital markets could adversely affect our clients’ ability to finance projects and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions project delays and payment delays or defaults by our clients in addition clients may be unable to fund new projects may choose to make fewer capital expenditures or otherwise slow their spending on our services or to seek contract terms more favorable to them our government clients may face budget deficits that prohibit them from funding proposed and existing projects or that cause them to exercise their right to terminate our contracts with little or no prior notice in addition any financial difficulties suffered by our subcontractors or suppliers could increase our cost or adversely impact project schedules these disruptions could materially impact our backlog and have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are therefore subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices after we have already committed resources to their projects in weak economic environments we may experience increased delays and failures due to among other reasons our clients’ unwillingness to pay for alleged poor performance or to preserve their own working capital if one or more clients delays in paying or fails to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

furthermore our cash balances and shortterm investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america europe south america australia and asia some of our accounts hold deposits in 

page 20 

amounts that exceed available insurance although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership or have been seized by their governments there is a risk that such events may occur in the future if any such events were to occur we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

maintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts 

in line with industry practice we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds or letters of credit to our customers these instruments indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract if a bond or a letter of credit is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond or letter of credit we cannot pursue that project historically we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity but as is typically the case the issuance of a bond is at the surety’s sole discretion and the issuance of a letter of credit is based on the companys creditworthiness because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms in addition future projects may require us to obtain letters of credit that extend beyond the term of our existing credit facilities our inability to obtain adequate bonding and as a result to bid on new contracts that require such bonding or letter of credit could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends on our common stock 

our board of directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program in fiscal 2017 under which we have paid and intend to continue paying regular quarterly dividends the declaration amount and timing of such dividends are subject to capital availability and determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and applicable agreements our ability to pay dividends will depend upon among other factors our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions including acquisitions debt service requirements results of operations financial condition and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant a reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments andor our dividend program could have a material negative effect on our stock price 

past and future environmental health and safety laws could impose significant additional costs and liabilities 

we are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities 

various us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants the liability under these laws may be joint and several we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen cleanup obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

when we perform our services our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions we may be subject to liability claims by employees customers and third parties as a result of such exposures in addition we may be subject to fines penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws a claim if not covered or only partially covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

health safety and environmental laws and regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes thereto could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could for example relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and in turn could negatively impact our revenue changes in the environmental laws and regulations remediation obligations enforcement actions stricter interpretations of existing requirements future discovery of contamination or claims for damages to persons property natural resources or the environment could result in material costs and liabilities that we currently do not anticipate if we fail to 

page 21 

comply with any environmental health or safety laws or regulations whether actual or alleged we could be exposed to fines penalties or potential litigation liabilities including costs settlements and judgments any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments which may require us or our clients to obtain and to comply with federal state and local government permits and approvals any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial revocation or modification under various circumstances failure to obtain or comply with or the loss or modification of the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and result of operations 

if we fail to comply with federal state local or foreign governmental requirements our business may be adversely affected 

we are subject to us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business for example our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders which requires full compliance with both export regulatory laws and international trafficking in arms regulations “itar” although we have policies and procedures to comply with us and foreign international trade laws the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges or debarment from participation in us government contracts and could damage our reputation and our ability to do business 

employee agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts which could result in reduced revenues and profits 

misconduct fraud noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or other improper activities by one of our employees agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations regulations regarding the protection of classified information regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts regulations on lobbying or similar activities regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting regulations pertaining to export control environmental laws employee wages pay and benefits and any other applicable laws or regulations for example we routinely provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters if a security breach were to occur our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective and we could face unknown risks or losses our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties cancellation of contracts loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act of 2010 and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices despite our training and compliance programs there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions including contract cancellations or debarment and loss of reputation any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the loss of or a significant reduction in business from one or a few customers could have a material adverse impact on us 

a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue andor backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years for example in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  approximately 23  19  and 21  respectively of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government although we have longstanding relationships with many of our significant clients our clients may unilaterally reduce delay or cancel their contracts at any time our loss of or a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

page 22 

our international operations are exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies 

for fiscal 2018  approximately 36  of our revenue was earned from clients outside the us our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues our international operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

 the lack of a welldeveloped legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights in addition military action geopolitical shifts or continued unrest particularly in the middle east could impact the supply or pricing of oil disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere and increase our security costs to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic political and other conditions our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we work in international locations where there are high security risks which could result in harm to our employees or unanticipated cost 

some of our services are performed in highrisk locations where the country or location is subject to political social or economic risks or war terrorism or civil unrest in those locations where we have employees or operations we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel despite these activities in these locations we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel and we may suffer future losses of employees and subcontractors acts of terrorism and threats of armed conflicts in or around various areas in which we operate could limit or disrupt markets and our operations including disruptions resulting from the evacuation of personnel cancellation of contracts or the loss of key employees contractors or assets 

foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects 

our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects both positive and negative that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar into the us dollar while we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in the currencies of our expenditures we do enter into contracts that expose us to currency risk particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs we attempt to minimize our exposure from currency risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies or entering into derivative hedging instruments when 

page 23 

there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts these actions however may not always eliminate currency risk exposure the governments of certain countries have or may in the future impose restrictive exchange controls on local currencies and it may not be possible for us to engage in effective hedging transactions to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in a particular currency based on fluctuations in currency the us dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly we may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries 

our operations may be impacted by the united kingdom’s proposed exit from the european union 

in june 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the uk’s exit from the eu there may be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the uk and eu countries and increased regulatory complexities these changes may adversely affect our relationships with our existing and future customers suppliers employees and subcontractors or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the ongoing negotiations between the uk and the eu as to the terms upon which the uk will exit from the eu and the uncertainty as to their future trade agreement continues to create economic uncertainty which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs terminate or reduce the scope of existing contracts decrease or postpone currently planned contracts or negotiate for more favorable deal terms each of which may have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties 

our business strategy involves growth through among other things the acquisition of other companies acquiring companies including ch2m hill companies ltd which we acquired in december 2017 presents a number of risks including 

 while we may obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses andor insurance that could mitigate certain of these risks such rights may be difficult to enforce the losses may exceed any dedicated escrow funds and the 

page 24 

indemnitors may not have the ability to financially support the indemnity or the insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover all losses 

if our management is unable to successfully integrate acquired companies or implement our growth strategy our operating results could be harmed in addition even if the operations of an acquisition are integrated successfully we may not realize the full benefits of an acquisition including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all moreover we cannot assure that we will continue to successfully expand or that growth or expansion will result in profitability 

in addition there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us existing cash balances and cash flow from operations together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities may be insufficient to make acquisitions future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing which may not be available on attractive terms or at all acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 

in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make we could dilute share ownership 

one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities if we issue additional equity securities such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders’ individual ownership percentages in the company 

we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which if not timely remediated may adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of our financial statements and our reputation business and the price of our common stock as well as lead to a loss of investor confidence in us 

as described under item 9a “controls and procedures” below management has concluded that a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting specifically regarding the accounting for income taxes in connection with the ch2m business combination existed as of september 28 2018 and accordingly internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

we  will take immediate action to remediate this material weakness  while we believe the steps described under item 9a below will improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and remediate the identified deficiencies if our remediation efforts are insufficient to address the material weakness or we identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future our ability to analyze record and report financial information accurately to prepare our financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the sec and to otherwise comply with our reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and our longterm debt agreements will likely be adversely affected the occurrence of or failure to remediate this material weakness and any future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of our financial statements and have other consequences that could materially and adversely affect our business including an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock potential actions or investigations by the sec or other regulatory authorities possible defaults under our debt agreements shareholder lawsuits a loss of investor confidence and damage to our reputation 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly or fall below the expectations of securities analysts which could have a material adverse impact on the price of our common stock fluctuations are caused by a number of factors including 



page 25 

 our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements 

in preparing our financial statements our management is required under us gaap to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities areas requiring significant estimates by our management include 

 our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

an impairment charge on our goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 

because we have grown in part through acquisitions goodwill and intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets under us gaap we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach as of september 28 2018  we had 610 billion  of goodwill representing 483  of our total assets of 1265 billion  we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business potential government actions toward our facilities and other factors 

if our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value we could be required to record an impairment charge the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing please see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  below 

we may be required to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and postretirement benefit plans we manage 

page 26 

we have various employee benefit plan obligations that require us to make contributions to satisfy over time our underfunded benefit obligations which are generally determined by calculating the projected benefit obligations minus the fair value of plan assets for example as of september 28 2018  and september 29 2017  our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by 3393 million  and 2520 million  respectively see note 10 pension and other postretirement benefit plans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k for additional disclosure in the future our benefit plan obligations may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of interest rates pension plan asset performance and other factors if we are required to contribute a significant amount of the deficit for underfunded benefit plans our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

rising inflation interest rates andor construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts in particular with respect to our fixedprice contracts 

rising inflation interest rates or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services in addition we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixedprice because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from costreimbursable type contracts approximately 76  during fiscal 2018 the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor however if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixedprice and lumpsum work is more prevalent inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future therefore increases in inflation interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change 

growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations legislation international protocols regulation or other restrictions on emissions could result in increased compliance costs for us and our clients and have other impacts on our clients including those who are involved in the exploration production or refining of fossil fuels emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels or emit greenhouse gases through the mining manufacture utilization or production of materials or goods such policy changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or in some cases prevent a project from going forward thereby potentially reducing the need for our services which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations however these changes could also increase the pace of projects such as carbon capture or storage projects that could have a positive impact on our business we cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers 

our effective tax rate may increase or decrease 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation the introduction of new tax accounting standards legislation regulations and related interpretations our global mix of earnings the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate or an ultimate determination that the company owes more taxes than the amounts previously accrued could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

systems and information technology interruption or failure and data security or privacy breaches could adversely impact our ability to operate or expose us to significant financial losses and reputational harm 

we rely heavily on computer information and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business from time to time we experience occasional system interruptions and delays in the event we are unable to regularly deploy software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems the operation of such systems could be interrupted or result in the loss corruption or release of data in addition our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters force majeure events telecommunications failures power loss acts of war or terrorism computer viruses malicious code physical or electronic security breaches intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error or similar events or disruptions any of these or other events could cause interruptions delays loss of critical andor sensitive data or similar effects which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition protection of intellectual property and results of operations as well as those of our clients 

page 27 

in addition we face the threat to our computer systems of unauthorized access computer hackers computer viruses malicious code ransomware organized cyberattacks and other security problems and system disruptions including possible unauthorized access to and disclosure of our and our clients’ proprietary or classified information 

  

while we have security measures and technology in place to protect our and our clients’ proprietary or classified information if these measures fail as a result of a cyberattack other thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and someone obtains unauthorized access to our or our clients’ information our reputation could be damaged our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures as a result we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of system disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these disruptions and breaches any of these events could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition new laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information including the european union general data protection regulation pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate costs and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties and legal liability 

we continuously evaluate the need to upgrade andor replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our computing environment to stay current on vendor supported products and to improve the efficiency of our systems and for other business reasons the implementation of new systems and information technology could adversely impact our operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems in addition our systems implementations may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated systems implementation disruption and any other information technology disruption if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have an adverse effect on our business 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or that of our clients 

our technology and intellectual property provide us in certain instances with a competitive advantage although we protect our property through registration licensing contractual arrangements security controls and similar mechanisms we may not be able to successfully preserve our rights and they could be invalidated circumvented challenged or become obsolete trade secrets are generally difficult to protect our employees and contractors are subject to confidentiality obligations but this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information andor infringement of our intellectual property in addition the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the us if we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights even if ultimately successful could be costly and could divert management’s attention away from other aspects of our business 

we also hold licenses from third parties which may be utilized in our business operations if we are no longer able to license such technology on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise our business and financial performance could be adversely affected 

if our intellectual property rights or work processes become obsolete we may not be able to differentiate our service offerings and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers our competitors may independently attempt to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies 

our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property there is a risk we may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and as a result could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities loss of contracts or other consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control 

extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control such as natural or manmade disasters could negatively impact our ability to operate as an example from time to time we face unexpected severe weather conditions which may result in weatherrelated delays that are not always reimbursable under a fixedprice contract evacuation of personnel and curtailment of 

page 28 

services increased labor and material costs in areas resulting from weatherrelated damage and subsequent increased demand for labor and materials for repairing and rebuilding inability to deliver materials equipment and personnel to job sites in accordance with contract schedules and loss of productivity we may remain obligated to perform our services after any such natural or manmade event unless a force majeure clause or other contractual provision provides us with relief from our contractual obligations if we are not able to react quickly to such events or if a high concentration of our projects are in a specific geographic region that suffers from a natural or manmade catastrophe our operations may be significantly affected which could have a material adverse impact on our operations in addition if we cannot complete our contracts on time we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients which may reduce our profits 

we are subject to professional standards duties and statutory obligations on professional reports and opinions we issue which could subject us to monetary damages 

we issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional engineering expertise as well as our other professional credentials that subject us to professional standards duties and obligations regulating the performance of our services for example we issue opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings if a client or another third party alleges that our report or opinion is incorrect or it is improperly relied upon and we are held responsible we could be subject to significant monetary damages in addition our reports and other work product may need to comply with professional standards licensing requirements securities regulations and other laws and rules governing the performance of professional services in the jurisdiction where the services are performed we could be liable to third parties who use or rely upon our reports and other work product even if we are not contractually bound to those third parties these events could in turn result in monetary damages and penalties 

delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control 

we are a delaware corporation certain antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us in addition certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover for example 

 these types of provisions as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders accordingly shareholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares 

risks relating to the sale of our ecr business 

if the sale of our ecr business to worleyparsons limited is not completed we will have incurred substantial expenses without our stockholders realizing the expected benefits 

on october 21 2018 we entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement the “purchase agreement” with worleyparsons limited a company incorporated in australia “buyer” pursuant to which subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions therein we will sell and assign to buyer our energy chemicals and resources businesses the “ecr business” completion of the transaction is subject to closing conditions including but not limited to various regulatory approvals we currently expect that the transaction will be completed during the first half of calendar 2019 it is possible however that factors outside of our control including but not limited to buyer’s ability to secure the financing it needs to complete the transaction could require the parties to complete the transaction at a later time or not to complete the transaction at all in the event that the transaction is not consummated for any reason we will be subject to certain risks including the costs related to the transaction such as legal accounting and advisory fees which must be paid even if the transaction is not completed if the transaction is not consummated the market price of our common stock could decline we also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the transaction or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the purchase agreement additionally if the transaction is not consummated there may not be an alternative party interested in and able to purchase the ecr business and if an alternative party is identified such alternative transaction may not result in a comparable aggregate purchase price to what is proposed in this transaction 

we will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the transaction is pending 

page 29 

the pursuit of the transaction and the preparation for the integration of the related assets with buyer may place a significant burden on management and internal resources additionally our continued success depends in part upon our ability to retain the talents and dedication of our employees and employees may decide not to remain with us while the transaction is pending any significant diversion of management and employee attention away from ongoing business loss of employees and difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could affect our financial results 

in addition the purchase agreement generally requires that we operate the ecr business in theordinary course of business and restricts us from taking certain actions including selling any assets of the ecr business prior to the consummation of the transaction or termination of the purchase agreement without buyer’s consent these restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the transaction additionally as a result of these business uncertainties our current and potential business partners may decide to delay defer or cancel entering into new business arrangements with us pending completion or termination of the transaction 

regulatory approvals including antitrust approval necessary for closing the purchase agreement may not be received may take longer than expected or impose conditions that are not presently anticipated 

before the transaction may be completed certain approvals or consents must be obtained from the various regulatory authorities in the united states and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which the ecr business operates including the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended the “hsr act” the approvals required pursuant to or in connection with the competition laws of certain foreign jurisdictions in which the ecr business operates and the receipt of approval from the committee on foreign investment in the united states “cfius” there can be no assurance as to whether regulatory approvals will be received or the timing of the approvals buyer is only required to take commercially reasonable efforts to assist us in obtaining regulatory approvals of the transaction 

under the purchase agreement we will be responsible for indemnifying buyer with respect to certain liabilities in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

we have agreed to indemnify buyer for damages resulting from or arising out of any liabilities relating to the ecr business not assumed by buyer in the transaction and for certain other matters significant indemnification claims by buyer could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition any event that results in a right for buyer to seek indemnity from us under the purchase agreement could result in a substantial payment from us to buyer and could adversely affect our results of operations 

we may be held liable to buyer if we fail to perform certain services under the transition services agreement and the performance of such services may negatively impact our business and operations 

we have agreed to enter into a transition services agreement with buyer in connection with the transaction pursuant to which we will provide buyer on an interim transitional basis various services including but not limited to executive consultation services employee benefits administration human resources and payroll services tax services financial and accounting services information technology services regulatory services project management services for certain client contracts general administrative services and other support services if we do not satisfactorily perform our obligations under the agreement we may be required to reperform such services at no additional cost in addition during the transition services period our management and employees may be required to divert their attention away from our business in order to provide services to buyer which could adversely affect our business 

because the share consideration component of the purchase price is fixed and the market price of buyer’s ordinary shares and the exchange rate between us and australian dollars may fluctuate we cannot be sure of the value of buyer’s ordinary shares that we will receive on the closing date or at the time we seek to sell the ordinary shares 

upon completion of the transaction we will receive 58197867 buyer’s ordinary shares the number of buyer’s ordinary shares that we will receive in the transaction is fixed and will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of buyer’s ordinary shares or for any changes in the exchange rate between us and australian dollars which will both likely fluctuate before and after the completion of the transaction fluctuations in the value of the buyer’s ordinary shares could result from changes in their business or the ecr business’ operations or prospects regulatory considerations general market and economic conditions and other factors both within and beyond the control of us or buyer prior to or following the closing of the transaction additionally under the terms of the purchase agreement the buyer’s ordinary shares we receive will be subject to a sixmonth lockup period following the transaction’s closing during which time we will be unable to sell the ordinary shares and during which time the market price of buyer’s ordinary shares and the exchange rate between us and australian dollars will likely fluctuate for the

forgoing reasons which could result in the ordinary shares we receive having a lower value compared to the value of the ordinary shares at the time we entered into the purchase agreement

critical accounting policies and estimates 

in order to better understand the changes that occur to key elements of our financial condition results of operations and cash flows a reader of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business performing longterm engineering and constructiontype contracts requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect both the entity’s results of operations and the carrying values of its assets and liabilities although our significant accounting policies are described in note 2  significant accounting policies  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k the following discussion is intended to highlight and describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

page 34 

revenue accounting for contracts  we recognize revenue earned on our technical professional and field services projects under the percentageofcompletion method described in asc 60535 constructiontype and productiontype contracts  in general we recognize revenues at the time we provide services precontract costs are generally expensed as incurred unless they are directly associated with an anticipated contract and recoverability from that contract is probable contracts are generally segmented between types of services such as engineering and construction and accordingly gross margin related to each activity is recognized as those separate services are rendered for multiple contracts with a single customer we account for each contract separately 

the percentageofcompletion method of accounting is applied by comparing contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion contract losses are provided for in their entirety in the period they become known without regard to the percentageofcompletion 

unapproved change orders are included in the contract price to the extent it is probable that such change orders will result in additional contract revenue and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated claims meeting these recognition criteria are included in revenues only to the extent of the related costs incurred 

certain costreimbursable contracts include incentivefee arrangements these incentive fees can be based on a variety of factors but the most common are the achievement of target completion dates target costs andor other performance criteria failure to meet these targets can result in unrealized incentive fees we recognize incentive fees based on expected results using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting as the contract progresses and more information becomes available the estimate of the anticipated incentive fee that will be earned is revised as necessary we bill incentive fees based on the terms and conditions of the individual contracts in certain situations we are allowed to bill a portion of the incentive fees over the performance period of the contract in other situations we are allowed to bill incentive fees only after the target criterion has been achieved incentive fees which have been recognized but not billed are included in receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

certain costreimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment in this situation revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts in those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs not allowable under the terms of the contract we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly 

when we are directly responsible for subcontractor labor or thirdparty materials and equipment we reflect the costs of such items in both revenues and costs and we refer to such costs as “passthrough” costs on those projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs 

 joint ventures  as is common to the industry we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures although the joint ventures own and hold the contracts with the clients the services required by the contracts are typically performed by us and our joint venture partners or by other subcontractors under subcontracting agreements with the joint ventures many of these joint ventures are formed for a specific project the assets of our joint ventures generally consist almost entirely of cash and receivables representing amounts due from clients and the liabilities of our joint ventures generally consist almost entirely of amounts due to the joint venture partners for services provided by the partners to the joint ventures under their individual subcontracts and other subcontractors in general at any given time the equity of our joint ventures represents the undistributed profits earned on contracts the joint ventures hold with clients very few of our joint ventures have employees or thirdparty debt or credit facilities the debt held by the joint ventures is nonrecourse to the general credit of jacobs the assets of a joint venture are restricted for use to the obligations of the particular joint venture and are not available for general operations of the company our risk of loss on these arrangements is usually shared with our partners the liability of each partner is usually joint and several which means that each partner may become liable for the entire risk of loss on the project furthermore on some of our projects the company has granted guarantees which may encumber both our contracting subsidiary company and the company for the entire risk of loss on the project see note 15 contractual guarantees litigation investigations and insurance  for further discussion 

many of the joint ventures are deemed to be variable interest entities “vie” because they lack sufficient equity to finance the activities of the joint venture the company uses a qualitative approach to determine if the company is the primary beneficiary of the vie which considers factors that indicate a party has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the joint venture’s economic performance these factors include the composition of the governing board how board decisions are approved the powers granted to the operational managers and partner that holds that positions and to a certain extent the partner’s economic interest in the joint venture the company analyzes each joint venture initially to determine if it should be consolidated or unconsolidated 

page 35 

 sharebased payments  we measure the value of services received from employees and directors in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grantdate fair value of the award the computed value is recognized as a noncash cost on a straightline basis over the period the individual provides services which is typically the vesting period of the award with the exception of awards containing an internal performance measure which are recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period subject to the probability of meeting the performance requirements and adjusted for the number of shares expected to be earned 

accounting for pension plans  the accounting for pension plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans’ assets and liabilities these assumptions include discount rates investment returns and projected salary increases among others the actuarial assumptions used in determining the funded statuses of the plans are provided in note 10   pension and other postretirement benefit plans of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

the expected rates of return on plan assets for fiscal 2019 range from 29 to 75  and were 35 to 85  for fiscal 2018  we believe the range of rates selected for fiscal 2019 reflects the longterm returns expected on the plans’ assets considering recent market conditions projected rates of inflation the diversification of the plans’ assets and the expected real rates of market returns the discount rates used to compute plan liabilities were changed from a range of 13 to 70  in fiscal 2017  to a range of 13 to 81  in fiscal 2018  these assumptions represent the company’s best estimate of the rates at which its pension obligations could be effectively settled 

changes in the actuarial assumptions often have a material effect on the values assigned to plan assets and liabilities and the associated pension expense for example if the discount rate used to value the net pension benefit obligation “pbo” at september 28 2018  was higher by 05 the pbo would have been lower at that date by approximately 1802 million for nonus plans and by approximately 219 million for us plans if the expected return on plan assets was higher by 10 the net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2018  would be lower by approximately 187 million for nonus plans and by approximately 37 million for us plans differences between actuarial assumptions and actual performance ie actuarial gains and losses that are not recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost in the period in which such differences arise are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are recognized as part of net periodic pension cost in future periods in accordance with us gaap management monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in an effort to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used 

 contractual guarantees litigation investigations and insurance  in the normal course of business we make contractual commitments some of which are supported by separate guarantees and on occasion we are a party in a litigation or arbitration proceeding the litigation in which we are involved includes personal injury claims professional liability claims and breach of contract claims in most cases we are the defendant where we provide a separate guarantee it is strictly in support of the underlying contractual commitment guarantees take various forms including surety bonds required by law or standby letters of credit loc also referred to as “bank guarantees” or corporate guarantees given to induce a party to enter into a contract with a subsidiary standby locs are also used as security for advance payments or in various other transactions the guarantees have various expiration dates ranging from an arbitrary date to completion of our work eg engineering only to completion of the overall project we maintain insurance coverage for most insurable aspects of our business and operations our insurance programs have varying coverage limits depending upon the type of insurance and include certain conditions and exclusions which insurance companies may raise in response to any claim that the company brings we have also elected to retain a portion of losses and liabilities that occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under our insurance programs as a result we may be subject to a future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured we intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of the contracts which the company enters with its clients our insurers are also subject to business risk and as a result one or more of them may be unable to fulfill their insurance obligations due to insolvency or otherwise 

additionally as a contractor providing services to the us federal government we are subject to many types of audits investigations and claims by or on behalf of the government including with respect to contract performance pricing cost allocations procurement practices labor practices and socioeconomic obligations furthermore our income franchise and similar tax returns and filings are also subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service most states within the us as well as by various government agencies representing jurisdictions outside the us 

page 36 

our consolidated balance sheets include amounts representing our probable estimated liability relating to such claims guarantees litigation audits and investigations we perform an analysis to determine the level of reserves to establish for insurancerelated claims that are known and have been asserted against us as well as for insurancerelated claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates we include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations 

testing goodwill for possible impairment  the goodwill carried on our consolidated balance sheets is tested annually for possible impairment and on an interim basis if indicators of possible impairment exist for purposes of impairment testing goodwill is assigned to the applicable reporting units based on the current reporting structure in performing the annual impairment test we evaluate our goodwill at the reporting unit level the company performs the annual goodwill impairment test for the reporting units at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year however during the quarter ended september 28 2018  the company voluntarily changed the date of its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing from the last day of the fiscal third quarter to the first day of the fourth quarter this voluntary change is expected to result in better alignment of the companys annual impairment test with the company’s strategic planning and forecasting process the voluntary change in accounting principle related to the annual testing date will not delay accelerate or avoid an impairment charge it would be impracticable to apply this change retrospectively because retrospective application would require reliance on significant estimates and assumptions with the use of hindsight accordingly this change will only be applied prospectively 

additionally during the second quarter of fiscal 2018  we reorganized our operating and reporting structure around three global lines of business “lobs” which also serve as the company’s operating segments i aerospace technology environmental and nuclear ii buildings infrastructure and advanced facilities and iii energy chemicals and resources this reorganization occurred in conjunction with the integration of ch2m into the companys legacy businesses and was intended to better serve our global clients leverage our workforce help streamline operations and provide enhanced growth opportunities the company’s lob leadership and internal reporting structures report to the chief executive officer who is also the chief operating decision maker “codm” and enable the codm to evaluate the performance of each of these segments and make appropriate resource allocations among each of the segments for purposes of the company’s goodwill impairment testing it has been determined that the company’s operating segments are also its reporting units based on management’s conclusion that the components comprising each of its operating segments share similar economic characteristics and meet the aggregation criteria for reporting units in accordance with asc 350 intangiblesgoodwill and other 

us gaap does not prescribe a specific valuation method for estimating the fair value of reporting units any valuation technique used to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including revenue growth rates operating margins discount rates and future market conditions among others 

we used an income approach to test our goodwill for possible impairment which requires us to make estimates and judgments under the income approach fair value is determined by using the discounted cash flows of our reporting units the company’s discount rate reflects a weighted average cost of capital “wacc” for a peer group of companies representative of the company’s respective reporting units the fair values for each reporting unit exceeded the respective book values ranging from 31 to 132 

it is possible that changes in market conditions economy facts and circumstances judgments and assumptions used in estimating the fair value could change resulting in possible impairment of goodwill in the future the fair values resulting from the valuation techniques used are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of the reporting units to willing third parties 

we have determined that the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values for the consolidated balance sheets presented 

restructuring and other charges 

during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 the company implemented certain restructuring and preintegration plans associated with the closing of its acquisition of ch2m which occurred on december 15 2017 the restructuring activities and related costs under these plans were comprised mainly of severance and lease abandonment programs while the preintegration activities and costs were mainly related to the engagement of consulting services and internal personnel and other related costs dedicated to the company’s acquisition integration management efforts 

following the closing of the ch2m acquisition these activities have continued into fiscal 2018 and include restructuring activities amounting to approximately 1017 million  in pretax charges during the year ended september 28 2018  combined with 892 million  in integration activities for the same period the total cost of these restructuring and integration activities approximated 

page 37 

1908 million  for the year ended september 28 2018  these activities are expected to continue through fiscal 2019  these activities are not expected to involve the exit of any service types or client endmarkets also during fiscal 2018 the company disposed of its investment in guimar in order to resolve potential conflicts arising from the ch2m acquisition which resulted in a loss as discussed below 

during the second fiscal quarter of 2017 the company entered into strategic business restructuring activities associated with realignment of its europe united kingdom uk and middle east regional operations in our biaf segment pretax net charges of 226 million  were recorded associated mainly with net realizable value writeoffs on contract accounts receivable of 165 million  with additional charges recorded for statutory redundancy and severance costs of 14 million  and other liabilities of 47 million  

during the second fiscal quarter of 2015 the company began implementing a series of initiatives intended to improve operational efficiency reduce costs and better position itself to drive growth of the business in the future we refer to these initiatives in the aggregate as the “2015 restructuring” these activities evolved and developed over time as management identified and evaluated opportunities for changes in the company’s operations and related areas of potential cost savings as economic conditions changed and as the realignment of the company’s operations into its global lob structure was implemented actions related to the 2015 restructuring included involuntary terminations the abandonment of certain leased offices combining operational organizations and the colocation of employees into other existing offices these activities did not involve the exit of any service types or client endmarkets the 2015 restructuring was completed in fiscal 2017 although cash payments continue to be made under the related accruals recorded in connection with these activities 

collectively the above mentioned restructuring activities are referred to as “restructuring and other charges” 

the following table summarizes the impacts of the restructuring and other charges or recoveries which primarily relate to the reversals of lease abandonment accruals related to previously vacated facilities which are now planned to be utilized on the companys reportable segment income by line of business in connection with the ch2m acquisition for the year ended september 28 2018  and the 2015 restructuring and realignment of the companys biaf europe uk and middle east regional operations for the years ended september 29 2017  and september 30 2016  in thousands

2018 overview 

the companys net earnings for fiscal 2018  were 1634 million  or 117  per diluted share a decrease of 1303 million  or 444  from 2937 million  or 242  per diluted share for the corresponding period last year included in the company’s operating 

page 39 

results were  1401 million  or 101  per share in after tax restructuring and other charges 607 million  in ch2m and ecr transaction costs and 2592 million  in income tax charges associated with the tax cuts and jobs act “the act” enacted on december 22 2017 our fiscal 2017  results included 879 million  or 072  per share in after tax charges associated with restructuring and other charges and 106 million  in ch2m transaction costs income taxes for fiscal 2018  were 3816 million  an increase of 2757 million  or 2605  from 1058 million  due mainly to the impacts from the provisional remeasurement of the deferred tax items and other impacts from us tax reform 

on december 15 2017 the company completed the acquisition of ch2m an international provider of engineering construction and technical services by acquiring 100  of the outstanding shares of ch2m common stock and preferred stock the purpose of the acquisition was to further diversify the company’s market presence in the water nuclear and environmental remediation sectors and to further the company’s growth strategy the company paid total consideration of approximately  18 billion in cash excluding  3152  million of cash acquired and issued approximately  14 billion of jacobs’ common stock to the former stockholders and certain equity award holders of ch2m 

backlog at september 28 2018  was 273 billion  up 75 billion  from 198 billion  for the corresponding period last year new prospects and new sales remain strong and the company continues to have a positive outlook for many of the industry groups and markets in which our clients operate 

results of operations 

as previously noted by company management the company was continuing to finalize its year end audit processes including with respect to income taxes at the time of its 4th quarter earnings release in that regard the company’s 2018 income tax expense also includes approximately 150 million in deferred income taxes associated with final onetime adjustments with respect to valuation allowances on foreign tax credits associated with the acquisition of the ch2m business that had not been included in the company’s fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings release furnished on form 8k on november 20 2018 the impact of these adjustments was 10 per share for the year ended september 28 2018 

fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017   

total revenues for the year ended september 28 2018  were 1498 billion  an increase of 496 billion  or 495  from 1002 billion  for the corresponding period last year the increase in revenues was due primarily to favorable impacts from the ch2m acquisition which contributed approximately 381 billion  in incremental revenues for fiscal 2018  higher volumes in our legacy aten biaf and ecr businesses also contributed to the increase 

passthrough costs included in revenues for the year ended september 28 2018  were 306 billion  in comparison to 254 billion  in the prior year these yearoveryear increases are due primarily to impacts from the ch2m acquisition as well as to passthrough costs in revenues from the aten businesses in general passthrough costs are more significant on projects that have a higher content of field services activities passthrough costs are generally incurred at specific points during the life cycle of a project and are highly dependent on the needs of our individual clients and the nature of the clients’ projects however because we have hundreds of projects which start at various times within a fiscal year the effect of passthrough costs on the level of direct costs of contracts can vary between fiscal years without there being a fundamental or significant change to the underlying business 

gross profit for the year ended september 28 2018  was 283 billion  up 106 billion  or 596  from 177 billion  from the corresponding period in 2017  our gross profit margins were 189  and 177  for the years ended september 28 2018  and september 29 2017  respectively the higher volume impacts seen in our aten biaf and ecr businesses incremental benefits of the ch2m businesses acquired and our continuing strategic focus on realigning our portfolio to higher margin businesses and project execution drove improving gross profit and margins for the year over year periods 

selling general  administrative expenses for the year ended september 28 2018  were 218 billion  an increase  of 8004 million  or 580  from 138 billion  for the corresponding period last year the increase in sga expenses is due mainly to incremental sga expense from the ch2m businesses acquired of approximately 6503 million  during the 2018  period which included 993 million  of restructuring and other charges and deal related costs as well as higher personnel related costs year over year and charges associated with a legal matter of  150  million also unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange mainly from the stronger australian dollar and indian rupee approximated  160  million 

net interest expense for the year ended september 28 2018  was 678 million  an increase of 645 million  from 33 million  for the corresponding period last year the increases in net interest expense as compared to the corresponding periods last year was due primarily to higher levels of average debt balances outstanding related to financing activities for the acquisition of ch2m which was partially funded with term loan financing of  15  billion and revolving credit line borrowings of  850  million

miscellaneous expense net for the year ended september 28 2018  was 45 million  a decrease of 21 million  as compared to 66 million  for the corresponding period last year the increases were due primarily to unfavorable year over year impacts from unrealized gains and losses from foreign exchange 

gainloss on disposal of business and investments was 210 million  and 109 million  for the years ended september 28 2018  and september 29 2017  respectively the reported loss amounts for fiscal 2018 were associated mainly with the companys divestiture of its equity investment in the guimar joint venture the 2017  gain amount was associated mainly with the company’s divestiture of its equity investment in neste jacobs oy a joint venture between the company and neste corporation 

the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate is generally higher than the us statutory rate of 2460010276  primarily due to the impacts related to us tax reform and the integration of ch2ms tax attributes the following table reconciles total income tax expense using the statutory us federal income tax rate to the consolidated income tax expense shown in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings for the years ended september 28 2018  and september 29 2017  dollars in thousands 



the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate for the year ended september 28 2018  increased to 68788  from 269  in fiscal 2017  key drivers for this year over year increase include the impacts from the provisional remeasurement of the deferred tax items and other impacts from us tax reform 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act was enacted in the united states the act reduces the top corporate us federal statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 starting on january 1 2018 resulting in a blended statutory tax rate for fiscal year filers the company’s blended federal statutory tax rate for fiscal 2018 is 246  it also requires companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries places limitations and exclusions on varied tax deductions and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings the majority of the tax provisions are effective for the first tax year beginning after january 1 2018 which will be the company’s taxable year beginning fiscal 2019

page 41 

total revenues for the year ended september 29 2017  were 1002 billion  decrease  of 9414 million  or 86  from 1096 billion  for the corresponding period last year the decrease in revenues was due primarily to lower volumes in the ecr and aten lobs these lower volumes were driven mainly by lower field services volume primarily with ecr customers and the timing of project completions versus new project timing 

passthrough costs included in revenues for the year ended september 29 2017  were 254 billion  in comparison to 249 billion  in line with amounts in the corresponding period last year in general passthrough costs are more significant on projects that have a higher content of field services activities passthrough costs are generally incurred at specific points during the life cycle of a project and are highly dependent on the needs of our individual clients and the nature of the clients’ projects however because we have hundreds of projects which start at various times within a fiscal year the effect of passthrough costs on the level of direct costs of contracts can vary between fiscal years without there being a fundamental or significant change to the underlying business 

gross profit for the year ended september 29 2017  was 177 billion  an increase of 44 million  or 025  from the corresponding period in 2016  our gross profit margins were 177  and 161  for the years ended september 29 2017  and september 30 2016  respectively our continuing strategic focus on realigning our portfolio to higher margin businesses and project execution drove improving gross profit and margins for the year over year periods 

selling general  administrative expenses for the year ended september 29 2017  were 138 billion  decrease  of 492 million  or 344  from 143 billion  for the corresponding period last year the decrease in sga expenses for the comparative annual periods was due mainly to lower restructuring and other charges of 759  million and related savings from the 2015 restructuring these decreases were offset in part by higher year over year spending mainly in personnel related costs and professional service fees including an additional  171 million  associated with ch2m professional service fees and integration costs 

net interest expense for the year ended september 29 2017  was 33 million  a decrease of 41 million  from 74 million  for the corresponding period last year the decrease in interest expense for the year ended september 29 2017  as compared to the corresponding period last year was due primarily to the reversal of  25  million of accrued interest expense related to the statute expiration of a foreign tax reserve as well as higher levels of interest income 

miscellaneous expense net for the year ended september 29 2017  was 66 million  an increase as compared to 31 million  million for the corresponding period last year this change was due primarily to a reversal in fiscal 2016 of  51  million of accrued penalties related to the statute expiration of a foreign tax reserve which did not recur in fiscal 2017 offset in part by other miscellaneous charges 

gain loss on disposal of business and investments was 109 million  and 414 million  for the years ended september 29 2017  and september 30 2016  respectively the reported amounts for fiscal 2017 were associated mainly with the company’s divestiture of its equity investment in neste jacobs oy a joint venture between the company and neste corporation the 414 million  loss on disposal in fiscal 2016 was mainly attributable to the company’s loss on the sale of our french subsidiary of  244  million and a noncash writeoff on an equity investment of  170  million 

the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate is generally lower than the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the impacts of favorable tax rate differences in our foreign operations the following table reconciles total income tax expense using the statutory us federal income tax rate to the consolidated income tax expense shown in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings for the years ended september 29 2017  and september 30 2016  dollars in thousands 

page 42 



the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate for the year ended september 29 2017  increased to 269 from 252 for fiscal 2016  key drivers for this year over year increase include the impacts of lower foreign tax credit benefits and lower benefits from valuation allowance releases on foreign deferred tax assets partly offset by favorable impacts of us tax cost of foreign operations the nonrecurrence of 2016  tax rate change impacts on deferred income tax assets in the uk and favorable impacts from change in uncertain tax positions

aerospace technology environmental and nuclear 



fiscal 2018 vs 2017 

aerospace technology environmental and nuclear segment revenues for the year ended september 28 2018  were 437 billion  up 191 billion  or 774  from 246 billion  for the corresponding period last year the increase in revenues were due in large part to nuclear and environmental revenue resulting from the ch2m acquisition also our revenues were positively impacted by year over year revenue volume growth across our legacy portfolio highlighted by increased spending by customers in the us government business sector and our nuclear and defense unit in the uk impacts on revenues from favorable foreign currency were approximately 238 million for fiscal year 2018  

operating profit for the segment was 3119 million  for the year ended september 28 2018  up 1117 million  or 558  from 2002 million  for the corresponding period last year in addition to incremental operating profit benefits from the ch2m acquisition the increase from the prior year was primarily attributable to continued growth in profits from our us governmental business sector and improvements in our nuclear and defense unit in the uk and fee income with our uk joint venture sga for the aten segment increased for fiscal 2018 attributable mainly to incremental sga associated with the ch2m acquisition during the fiscal 2018 and additional charges of 150 million associated with a legal matter incurred during fiscal 2018 

fiscal 2017 vs 2016 

aerospace technology environmental and nuclear segment revenues for the year ended september 29 2017  were 246 billion  down 3816 million  or 134  from 285 billion  for the corresponding period in 2016 the decrease in revenues was mainly in our us government business sector where rebid losses and small business award preferences drove the declines unfavorable foreign currency impacts of approximately 130 million also contributed to this year over year decline these unfavorable items were partially offset by positive gains from organic growth and improvement in our telecommunications sector our nasa projects and our projects for the ministry of defense in australia 

operating profit for the aten segment was 2002 million  for the year ended september 29 2017  down 149 million  or 69  from 2151 million  for the year ended september 30 2016  this decrease in profitability was due primarily to the revenue declines in the us government business sector mentioned above as well as lower equity income from our uk joint venture for the comparative periods mainly associated with year over year declines in project funding

page 45 



fiscal 2018 vs 2017 

revenues for the buildings infrastructure and advanced facilities segment for the year ended september 28 2018  were 618 billion  up 235 billion  or 615  from 383 billion  for the corresponding period last year the increase in revenues was due in part to favorable impacts from the ch2m acquisition of approximately 222 billion together with revenue increases across all our businesses with strong investment in life sciences electronics water and transport infrastructure markets impacts on revenues from favorable foreign currency were approximately 596 million for fiscal 2018  

operating profit for the segment for the year ended september 28 2018  was 4823 million  an increase of 2186 million  or 829  from 2637 million  for the comparative period in 2017  the increase in operating profit was in part due to favorable impacts from the ch2m acquisition together with positive impacts from the higher year over year revenues for the segment sga for the biaf segment increased for fiscal 2018 with this increase being attributable mainly to incremental sga associated with the ch2m acquisition during fiscal 2018 

fiscal 2017 vs 2016 

revenues for the buildings infrastructure and advances facilities segment for the year ended september 29 2017  were 383 billion  an increase of 4112 million  or 120  versus 342 billion  for the corresponding period in 2016  the year over year increases in revenues was due mainly to us client spending level increases in the pmcm market and increased client major capex spending in the life sciences business year over year impacts on revenues from unfavorable foreign currency were approximately 360 million 

operating profit for the segment for the year ended september 29 2017  was 2637 million  up 463 million  or 213  compared to 2174 million  for 2016  excluded from the presented operating profit amounts for the year ending september 29 2017  were 238 million in restructuring and other charges related to strategic business restructuring activities in our uk middle east and europe businesses increases in profitability for the period in 2017  over 2016  were due mainly to higher revenue from the us pmcm projects and higher levels of professional service and project procurement business in the life sciences business partially offset by charges from a contract settlement of 60 million 

energy chemicals and resources 



fiscal 2018 vs 2017 

energy chemicals and resources revenues for the year ended september 28 2018  were 443 billion  an increase of   7000 million  or 188  from 373 billion  for the corresponding period last year the increase in revenues was due primarily to the ongoing execution of several large petrochemical projects with significant passthrough costs growth in the construction operations and maintenance market as clients focus on capital efficiency the continued recovery of mining and minerals market as clients begin the transition from feasibility studies into the investment phase of projects and the increasing trend among oil producers to drive downstream investments to refining and chemicals also the ch2m acquisition added approximately 2844 million during fiscal year 2018 additionally foreign currency impacts were favorable by approximately 564 million for fiscal 2018  versus the corresponding periods of 2017  

operating profit for the segment for the year ended september 28 2018  was  2181 million  an increase of 568 million  or 352  from 1613 million  for the corresponding period last year the increase in profitability was due to higher revenue and favorable mix across the portfolio sga for the segment was up 770 million for fiscal 2018  versus the 2017  periods due 

page 46 

mainly to incremental operating general and administrative expense coming with the ch2m acquisition additionally included in the prior fiscal year was a onetime 99 million benefit associated with benefit plan changes in our india operations 

fiscal 2017 vs 2016 

energy chemicals and resources revenues for the year ended september 29 2017  were 373 billion  a decrease of 9710 million  or 207  versus 470 billion  for the corresponding period in 2016  the decrease in revenues was primarily due to the completion or winddown of several projects with significant passthrough revenue as well as award delays of large post frontend engineering and design projects as clients continue to evaluate their capital spending plans as oil prices remained low and weaker market conditions in the mining and minerals business these factors resulted in lower field service revenues compared with the prior year periods while client investment spending continues primarily on compliance maintenance and sustaining capital programs additionally foreign currency impacts were unfavorable of approximately 180 million on year over year revenue comparisons for fiscal 2017  versus fiscal 2016  

operating profit for the segment for the year ended september 29 2017  was 1613 million  up 75 million  or 49  compared to 1538 million  for 2016  increases in profitability for the period in 2017  over 2016  were due mainly to improved project performance in the minings  minerals business and sga savings from restructuring efforts and a onetime 99 million benefit associated with benefit plan changes in our india operations offset by revenue declines from lower business volumes as mentioned above offset by revenue declines from lower business volumes mentioned previously 

other corporate expenses 

other corporate expense were 1137 million  816 million  and 601 million  for the years ended september 28 2018  september 29 2017  and september 30 2016  these increases were due primarily to increased intangible asset amortization relating to the ch2m acquisition higher professional service fees personnel related costs settlement charges associated with certain of the companys pension plans and higher depreciation associated with increased corporate technology investments partially offset by savings associated with the 2015 restructuring program 

included in other corporate expenses in the above table are costs and expenses which relate to general corporate activities as well as corporatemanaged benefit and insurance programs such costs and expenses include i those elements of sga expenses relating to the business as a whole ii those elements of our incentive compensation plans relating to corporate personnel whose other compensation costs are not allocated to the lobs iii the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations iv the quarterly variances between the company’s actual costs of certain of its selfinsured integrated risk and employee benefit programs and amounts charged to the lobs and v certain adjustments relating to costs associated with the company’s international defined benefit pension plans in addition other corporate expenses may also include from time to time certain adjustments to contract margins both positive and negative associated with projects where it has been determined in the opinion of management that such adjustments are not indicative of the performance of the related lob 

backlog information 

backlog is not a defined measure and our methodology for determining backlog may vary from the methodology used by other companies currently we report a combined backlog number based upon the legacy reporting methodologies used by jacobs and the acquired business of ch2m prior to the acquisition while we work to harmonize these reporting methodologies as part of the companys integration activities underway 

we include in backlog the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us our policy with respect to om contracts however is to include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for one succeeding year regardless of the remaining life of the contract for national government programs other than national government om contracts which are subject to the same policy applicable to all other om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding option periods because of variations in the nature size expected duration funding commitments and the scope of services required by our contracts the timing of when backlog will be recognized as revenues can vary greatly between individual contracts 

consistent with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the option of the client including our us government work while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog at any given time our backlog is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein backlog is not necessarily an indicator of future revenues 

page 47 

because certain contracts eg contracts relating to large epc projects as well as national government programs can cause large increases to backlog in the fiscal period in which we recognize the award and because many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years we evaluate our backlog on a yearoveryear basis rather than on a sequential quarteroverquarter basis 

please refer to item 1a risk factors   above for a discussion of other factors that may cause backlog to ultimately convert into revenues at different amounts 

the following table summarizes our backlog for the years ended september 28 2018  september 29 2017  and september 30 2016  in millions 



the increase in backlog in aerospace technology environmental and nuclear for the years presented were primarily the result of new awards from the us federal government and the ch2m acquisition in fiscal year 2018 

the increase in backlog in buildings infrastructure and advanced facilities for the years presented were primarily the result of new awards in australia and the us markets and the ch2m acquisition in fiscal year 2018 

the increase in backlog in energy chemicals and resources from fiscal year 2017 to 2018 was due to the ch2m acquisition offset in part by work off of projects in the americas with significant passthrough cost the decrease seen in from fiscal year 2017 to 2016 was primarily due to the weakness in the upstream market partly offset by strong performance in chemicals backlog 

backlog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies totaled approximately 68 billion or 249 of total backlog 46 billion or 232 of total backlog and 48 billion or 254 of total backlog at september 28 2018  september 29 2017  and september 30 2016  respectively most of our federal government contracts require that services be provided beyond one year in general these contracts must be funded annually ie the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the us congress to the procuring agency and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts 

we estimate that approximately 99 billion or 36 of total backlog at september 28 2018  will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year 

liquidity and capital resources 

at september 28 2018  our principal sources of liquidity consisted of  7934 million  in cash and cash equivalents 14484 million  of available borrowing capacity under our 16 billion 2014 revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” and cash flows from operating activities additional information regarding the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility is set forth in note 9  borrowings  in notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k we finance much of our operations and growth through cash generated by our operations 

on december 15 2017 the company completed the acquisition of ch2m hill companies ltd ch2m an international provider of engineering construction and technical services by acquiring 100 of the outstanding shares of ch2m common stock and preferred stock the company paid total consideration of approximately 18 billion in cash excluding 3152 million in cash acquired and issued approximately 14 billion of jacobs’ common stock to the former stockholders and certain equity award holders of ch2m in connection with the acquisition the company also assumed ch2m’s revolving credit facility and second lien notes including a 200 million prepayment penalty which totaled approximately 7000 million immediately following the effective time of the acquisition the company repaid ch2m’s revolving credit facility and second lien notes including the related prepayment penalty the company financed the cash consideration for the ch2m acquisition the repayment of ch2m’s outstanding indebtedness and other transaction expenses with a combination of cash on hand and debt financing which included borrowings under the term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 15 billion and additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility 

page 48 

at september 28 2018  our cash and cash equivalents were 7934 million  an increase of  191 million  from 7742 million  at september 29 2017  

this increase was due to cash flows provided by operations of 4812 million  and favorable cash flows from financing activities of 11 billion  partly offset by 16 billion  in cash flows used in investing activities and exchange rate effects on cash of 268 million  

our cash flow from operations of 4812 million  during fiscal 2018  was comparatively lower than the 5749 million  in cash flow from operations for the corresponding period in fiscal 2017  due mainly to higher levels of working capital mainly in accounts receivable lower net earnings attributable to the group cash used for payments on the opening balance sheet liabilities and post acquisition costs incurred in connection with the ch2m acquisition and payments associated with obligations from restructuring and other charges 

with respect to the company’s working capital accounts the company’s cash flows from operations are greatly affected by the costplus nature of our customer contracts because such a high percentage of our revenues are earned on costplus type contracts and due to the significance of revenues relating to passthrough costs most of the costs we incur are included in invoices we send to clients although we continually monitor our accounts receivable we manage the operating cash flows of the company by managing the working capital accounts in total rather than by the individual elements the primary elements of the company’s working capital accounts are accounts receivable accounts payable and billings in excess of cost accounts payable consist of obligations to third parties relating primarily to costs incurred for projects which are generally billable to clients accounts receivable consist of amounts due from our clients of which a substantial portion are for projectrelated costs billings in excess of cost consist of billings to and payments from our clients for costs yet to be incurred 

this relationship between revenues and costs and between receivables and payables is unique to our industry and facilitates review of our liquidity at the total working capital level 

our cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2018  of 16 billion  was comparatively higher than the 2362 million  cash used in investing activities for the corresponding period in fiscal 2017  which was primarily driven by cash used for the ch2m acquisition net of cash amounts acquired from the acquisition of 3152 million additions to property and equipment were slightly down from the comparative period 

our cash from financing activities of 11 billion  for fiscal 2018  resulted mainly from proceeds from borrowings of 58 billion  most of which was used in connection with financing of the ch2m acquisition repayments of longterm debt of 46 billion  during first half of fiscal 2018  were up compared to 18 billion  in fiscal 2017  with this increase due mainly to the payoff of ch2m’s legacy debt balances in connection with the closing of the acquisition comparatively lower cash flows from proceeds from issuances of common stock during fiscal 2018  were offset by lower cash outflows for common stock repurchases the company paid 866 million  in dividends including to noncontrolling interests of  46 million  during the year with 588 million  in dividends paid in the comparative prior year period 

at september 28 2018  the company had approximately 3429 million in cash and cash equivalents held in the us and 4505 million held outside of the us primarily in the uk the eurozone chile and india which is used primarily for funding operations in those regions other than the tax cost of repatriating funds to the us see note 13  income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k there are no material impediments to repatriating these funds to the us 

the company had 4466 million  in letters of credit outstanding at september 28 2018  of this amount 25 million  was issued under the revolving credit facility and 4441 million  was issued under separate committed and uncommitted letterofcredit facilities 

on october 21 2018 jacobs and worleyparsons limited a company incorporated in australia “buyer” entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement pursuant to which buyer agreed to acquire the company’s ecr business for a purchase price of 33 billion consisting of i 26 billion in cash plus ii ordinary shares of the buyer equal to 700 million subject to adjustments for changes in working capital and certain other items the “transaction” the transaction which has been approved by the boards of directors of the company and buyer is expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2019 

we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations and support our debt service and also to make discretionary payments such as the payment of dividends and buyback of shares and to support our ongoing acquisition strategy for the next twelve months based on the liquidity provided by our cash and cash equivalents on hand our borrowing capacity

 effects of inflation and changing prices 

the effects of inflation and changing prices on our business is discussed in item 1a risk factors   and is incorporated herein by reference 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are party to financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk in the form of guarantees not reflected in our balance sheet that arise in the normal course of business however such offbalance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or resources that are material to investors see note 14  commitments and contingencies and derivative financial instruments  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

new accounting pronouncements 

from time to time the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issues accounting standards updates each an “asu” to its accounting standards codification “asc” which constitutes the primary source of us gaap the company regularly monitors asus as they are issued and considers their applicability to its business all asus applicable to the company are adopted by the due date and in the manner prescribed by the fasb 

revenue recognition 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  the new guidance provided by asu 201409 is intended to remove inconsistencies and perceived weaknesses in the existing revenue requirements provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues improve comparability provide more useful information and simplify the preparation 

page 50 

of financial statements the effective date for asu 201409 is for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods therein 

the company’s adoption activities have been performed over three phases i assessment ii design and iii implementation as part of these phases the company has identified the following potentially significant differences to date 

performance obligations 

under current us gaap the company typically segments contracts that contain multiple services by service type  for instance engineering procurement and construction services  for purposes of revenue recognition under asu 201409 multipleservice contracts where the company is responsible for providing a single deliverable eg a constructed asset will be treated as a single performance obligation for purposes of revenue recognition and thus no longer will be segmented typically this will occur when the company is contracted to perform both engineering and construction on a project in these circumstances the timing and pattern of revenue recognition will change the remainder of the companys contracts will continue to be treated as having discrete units of account because they either contain only one service or because the company has determined that the component services in the contract are distinct 

contract modifications 

in many instances the company enters into separate contracts for related services eg engineering and construction but is held responsible for providing a single deliverable “phased projects” under asu 201409 the separate contracts may be required to be combined and treated as a single contract with one performance obligation this modification or combination of contracts may result in a cumulative catchup adjustment which will have an immediate impact on the company’s results of operations in the period the contract combination or modification occurs in addition it will change the timing and pattern of revenue recognition after the period the contracts have been combined or modified 

based on the two noted changes above the company has identified selected changes to our systems processes and internal controls and designed updates for each to meet the standards revised reporting and disclosure requirements the company has also assessed the impact of asu 201409 to the recently acquired ch2m business we will align ch2ms accounting policies processes and controls with the policies processes and controls being implemented across the company 

the company will adopt the new standard using the modified retrospective application for periods beginning with the first fiscal quarter of 2019 this standard will impact the company’s consolidated financial statements and will its administrative operations the impact will depend on the magnitude of the items discussed above while the company will continue to evaluate the impact through the implementation phase we expect a reduction of retained earnings in our consolidated financial statements in the period of adoption due to revenue recognition timing for certain engineering and construction contracts shifting as a result of being accounted for as a single performance obligation this adjustment will create a corresponding adjustment in the companys consolidated financial statements to accounts receivable and unbilled receivables and to billings in excess of costs 

lease accounting 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 leases  asu 201602 requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases asu 201602 is effective for public entity financial statements for annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods early adoption is permitted including adoption in an interim period the new guidance currently requires a modified retrospective transition approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements asu 201602 was further clarified and amended within asu 201713 asu 201801 asu 201810 and asu 201811 which included provisions that would provide us with the option to adopt the provisions of the new guidance using a modified retrospective transition approach without adjusting the comparative periods presented the company is evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements this standard could have a significant administrative impact on its operations and the company will further assess the impact through its implementation program 

other pronouncements 

in august 2017 the fasb issued asu no 201712 derivatives and hedging topic 815 targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities asu 201712 provides financial reporting improvements related to hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements additionally asu no 201712 makes certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of the hedge accounting guidance the revised guidance becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 with early adoption permitted the company is evaluating the impact of

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk in the normal course of business our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

please see the note 9 borrowings  in notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k which is incorporated herein by reference for a discussion of the revolving credit facility term loan facility and note purchase agreement 

our term loan facility revolving credit facility and certain other debt obligations are subject to variable rate interest which could be adversely affected by an increase in interest rates as of september 28 2018  we had an aggregate of 165 billion  in outstanding borrowings under our term loan facility and our revolving credit facility interest on amounts borrowed under these agreements is subject to adjustment based on the company’s consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreements governing the term loan facility and revolving credit facility depending on the company’s consolidated leverage ratio borrowings under the term loan facility and revolving credit facility bear interest at a eurocurrency rate plus a margin of between 10 and 15 or a base rate plus a margin of between 0 and 05 additionally if our consolidated leverage ratio exceeds a certain amount the interest on the senior notes may increase by 75 basis points 

for the year ended september 28 2018  our weighted average floating rate borrowings were approximately  20  billion if floating interest rates had increased by 100 our interest expense for the year ended september 28 2018  would have increased by approximately  204  million 

foreign currency risk 

in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency we attempt to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs in those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies we follow the provisions of asc no 815 derivatives and hedging  in accounting for our derivative contracts the company does not currently have exchange rate sensitive instruments that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations

tableend evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

the company’s management with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined by rule 13a15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of september 28 2018  the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k the “evaluation date” based on that evaluation and as a result of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below under managements annual report on internal control over financial reporting the chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the exchange act were not functioning effectively as of the evaluation date to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the company in reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

as permitted by sec guidance for newly acquired businesses management’s assessment of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures did not include an assessment of those disclosure controls and procedures of ch2m hill companies ltd ch2m that are subsumed by internal control over financial reporting ch2m accounted for approximately 42 of total assets as of september 28 2018 and 25 of revenues and 30 of operating profit for the fiscal year ended on september 28 2018 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining for the company adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act management with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the evaluation date based on the framework established in “internal control—integrated framework”  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework based on this assessment and the material weakness identified below management has concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the evaluation date was ineffective as permitted by sec guidance for newly acquired businesses management’s assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting did not include an assessment of internal control over financial reporting of ch2m ch2m accounted for approximately 42 of total assets as of september 28 2018 and 25 of revenues and 30 of operating profit for the fiscal year ended on september 28 2018 

management has identified the following material weakness as of september 28 2018 a material weakness related to internal control deficiencies over the accounting for income taxes in connection with a business combination specifically related to the ineffective design and operating effectiveness of controls over the completeness and accuracy of deferred taxes and the evaluation of the recoverability of deferred taxes associated with the ch2m acquisition 

the material weakness did not result in any material misstatements to the company’s previously issued financial statements nor in the financial statements included in this form 10k 

the companys independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp that audited the companys consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 28 2018 as stated in their report included in this annual report on form 10k 

remediation plan 

the companys management is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment in response to the identified material weakness management with the oversight of the audit committee of the board of directors will take comprehensive actions to remediate the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting including implementing additional specific enhanced control procedures for the review analysis and reporting of its deferred income tax accounts including control procedures relating to the recoverability of deferred taxes associated with acquired businesses in a business combination the company has commenced its remediation plan with the goal of remediating this material weakness as soon as possible subject to the conclusion by management that the enhanced internal control over financial reporting is operating effectively following appropriate testing the 

page 53 

remediation efforts are intended both to address the identified material weakness and to enhance our overall financial control environment as management continues to evaluate and work to improve the companys disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting the company may take additional measures to address these deficiencies or modify certain of the remediation measures described above 

changes in internal control 

subject to the above there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the company’s fiscal quarter ended september 28 2018  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

limitations on effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its system of internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed or operated can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of internal control are met the design of the company’s control system reflects the fact that there are resource constraints and that the benefits of such control systems must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control failures and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the intentional acts of individuals by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that the design of any particular control will always succeed in achieving its objective under all potential future conditions

since jacobs’ founding the company has been based on doing business honestly ethically and with the utmost integrity our culture and our code of conduct which all employees are required to sign annually prescribe that everyone at the company must adhere to jacobs’ values and ethical code and comply with the laws that govern the company’s activities worldwide our employees and business partners are expected to follow the highest principles of business conduct integrity and ethics as they carry out their responsibilities and are guided by the following principles in carrying out their responsibilities loyalty compliance with applicable laws observance of ethical standards avoidance of conflicts of interest and communication we endeavor to deal fairly with our employees customers suppliers and competitors and to respect the policies and procedures of those outside the company 

we strive to present a clear and consistent image of our company to our clients employees shareholders and business partners regarding how we behave how we communicate how we look and most importantly how our promises to our clients are delivered anywhere in the world 

page 4

we accomplish this foremost through our vision mission and values which allow us to behave as one company and unify us worldwid e by keeping our values as a central focus of our company we are able to think the same way and arrive at similar conclusions regardless of our physical location with respect to our values 











our vision statement “solutions for a more connected sustainable world” underpins our commitment to sustainability plan beyond is how we define and identify with our approach to sustainability building on beyondzero and our culture of caring plan beyond helps us to focus on looking beyond our company and how we contribute as a global corporate citizen our sustainability activities encompass jacobs stakeholders at jacobs including our clients our people and wider communities our supply chain partners and our investors

how we grow 

jacobs has grown significantly since its founding in 1947 both organic growth and strategic acquisitions play an important part of the company’s growth strategy we have acquired and integrated numerous companies over the years that have enhanced our capabilities geographic reach and offerings

in terms of organic growth our relationshipbased business model is central to our sustained growth and profitability we pursue the development of longterm relationships and alliances with our clients by working with our clients to solve their challenges we increase our understanding of their overall business needs as well as the unique technical requirements of their specific projects this increased understanding enables us to provide superior value to our clients our approach provides us with opportunities to market the following services to our clients











page 5

our relationships with clients also present ongoing opportunities to expand into adjacent marke ts for example clients operating in the mining and minerals market often have a need for our infrastructure and buildings capabilities the same is true for clients operating in other markets 

we market our services to clients in a wide range of public institutional process and industrial markets we increase our opportunities through focused market diversity and are able to price contracts competitively and enhance overall profitability while delivering additional value to our clients by integrating and bundling our services in complex economic times we believe we have the ability to evolve along with market cycles worldwide when opportunities decrease in a particular market or geography other opportunities often increase because of our focused market diversity we believe we are well positioned to address a wide range of opportunities across many markets and geographies which helps us grow our business

the role of acquisitions and strategic investments in the development of our business 

when we review acquisition targets we are conscious of the effect the acquisition may have on our client base we favor acquisitions that are aligned with our growth strategy which target enhancements of our capabilities and add value to our customers and shareholders we do this by i expanding into a new client market ii enhancing the range of services we provide existing clients andor iii accessing new geographic areas in which our clients either already operate or plan to expand by expanding into new geographic areas and adding to our existing technical and project management capabilities we strive to position ourselves as a preferred singlesource provider of technical professional and construction services to our clients

lines of business 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we reorganized our operations around four global lines of business or “lobs” this reorganization was intended to better serve our global clients leverage our workforce help streamline operations and provide enhanced growth opportunities our four global lines of business are aerospace  technology buildings  infrastructure industrial and petroleum  chemicals each lob has a president that reports directly to the companys chairman  ceo as part of the reorganization certain support functions ie sales which were managed centrally for many years have been embedded in the lines of business and report to the respective line of business presidents the costs of other support functions eg accounting legal information technology and other and certain other activities eg global insurance are assigned or allocated to each new lob using a rationale method of assignmentallocation or remain an element of corporate general and administrative expenses in connection with the reorganization the company significantly modified its cash incentive plan utilizing performance metrics aligned along the new lines of business

services 

our services fall into four broad categories project services process scientific and systems consulting services construction services and operations and maintenance services

project services 

we employ the engineering architecture interiors design planning and related disciplines necessary to design and engineer modern process plants buildings infrastructure projects technology and manufacturing facilities consumer products manufacturing facilities power plants and stations pulp and paper plants and other facilities

we are capable of providing our clients with a variety of value engineering services including safety in design through safety in design we integrate best practices hazard analysis and risk assessment methods early in the design phase of projects with the goal of eliminating or mitigating injury and damage during the construction startup testing and commissioning and operations phases of a project

in the area of construction management we provide our clients with a wide range of services as an agent for our clients we may act as program director whereby we oversee on the owners behalf the complete planning design and construction phases of the project alternatively our services may be limited to providing construction consulting

project services also includes planning scheduling procurement estimating cost engineering project accounting project delivery quality safety and all other key support services needed for complete cradletograve project delivery

process scientific and systems consulting services 

we employ the professional and technical skills and expertise with respect to a broad range of consulting services including performing pricing studies market analyses and financial projections necessary in determining the feasibility of a project performing gasoline reformulation modeling analyzing and evaluating layout and mechanical designs for complex processing plants analyzing automation and control systems analyzing designing and executing bio containment strategies developing and performing process protocols with respect to the us food and drug administrationmandated qualification and validation requirements and performing geological and metallurgical studies

also included in this service category are revenues relating to defense and aerospacerelated programs such services typically are more technical and scientific in nature than other project services we provide and may involve tasks such as supporting the development and testing of conventional weapons systems weapons modeling and simulations computer systems development maintenance and support evaluation and testing of missioncritical control systems aerospace testing and propulsion systems and facilities cyber security and it services and other highly technical or scientific tasks

construction services 

in addition to the construction management services included under project services above we provide traditional field construction services to private and public sector clients we also provide modular construction consulting services in the area of environmental remediation and restoration we also provide environmental remedial construction services for a variety of public and private sector clients

page 7

historically our field construction activities have been focused primarily on those construction proje cts for which we perform much of the related engineering and design work by focusing our construction efforts in this way we attempt to minimize the risks associated with constructing complex projects based on designs prepared by third parties the finan cial risk to us of constructing complex assets based on designs prepared by third parties may be particularly significant on fixedprice contracts  though we ensure appropriate controls are in place to manage risk however we will pursue constructiononly projects when we can negotiate pricing and other contract terms we deem acceptable and which we believe can result in a fair return for the degree of risk we assume 

operations and maintenance services 

operations and maintenance “om” refers to all of the tasks required to operate and maintain large complex facilities on behalf of clients we provide key management and support services over all aspects of the operations of a facility including managing subcontractors and other onsite personnel om also includes process plant maintenance services which generally involves all tasks required to keep a process plant typically a refinery or chemical plant in daytoday operation

within the aerospace and defense areas om often requires us to provide the management and technical support services necessary to operate and maintain such sites as engine test facilities weapons integration facilities and hightech simulation and verification centers such om contracts also frequently require us to provide facilities management and maintenance services utilities operations and maintenance services property management and disposition services and construction support services

within the environmental area om often includes engineering and technical support services as well as program management services necessary to remediate contaminated sites

although the gross profit margins we realize from om services are generally lower than those associated with the other services we provide the costs to support maintenance activities are also generally lower in addition om services offer us an opportunity to build and maintain longterm relationships with clients this aspect of om services greatly reduces the selling costs in respect of such services

the following table sets forth our revenues from each of our four service categories for the years ended september 29 2017 september 30 2016 and october 2 2015 in thousands

backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us with respect to om contracts however we include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for only one succeeding year regardless of the remaining life of the contract for national government programs other than us federal om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding option periods in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation termination or suspension at the discretion of the client in addition the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts accordingly backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings

our backlog includes expected revenues for contracts that are based on estimates the following table summarizes our backlog for the years ended september 29 2017 september 30 2016 and october 2 2015 in thousands 

 



for additional information regarding our backlog including those risk factors specific to backlog please refer to item 1a — risk factors  and item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below subject to the factors discussed in item 1a— risk factors below we estimate that approximately 7 billion or 35 of total backlog at september 29 2017 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year

significant customers 

the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government for each of the last five fiscal years 

 



 

given the percentage of total revenue derived directly from the us federal government the loss of us federal government agencies as customers would have a material adverse effect on the company in addition any or all of our government contracts could be terminated we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work or payment of our costs could be disallowed approximately 88 of revenue derived directly from the us federal government is in the aerospace  technology segment for more information on risks relating to our government contracts see item 1a  risk factors 

page 11

financial information about geographic areas 

selected financial information regarding the geographic areas in which we operate is included in note 15 — segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k and is incorporated herein by reference for fiscal 2017 approximately 42 of our revenues were earned from clients outside the united states our international operations are subject to a variety of risks which are described under item 1a  risk factors below

contracts 

while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake our contracts generally fall into two broad categories costreimbursable and fixedprice the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the last five fiscal years

 



 

in accordance with industry practice most of our contracts including those with the us federal government are subject to termination at the discretion of the client which is discussed in greater detail in item 1a — risk factors  in such situations our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination

when we are directly responsible for engineering design procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client’s plant or facility we reflect the costs of materials equipment and subcontracts in both revenues and costs on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs the following table sets forth the approximate amount of such passthrough costs included in revenues for each of the last five fiscal years in millions of dollars

 



 

costreimbursable contracts 

costreimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit the profit element may be in the form of a simple markup applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee or a combination of a markup and a fee the fee element can also take several forms the fee may be a fixed amount it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred or it may be an incentive fee based on targets milestones or performance factors defined in the contract in general we prefer costreimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price

fixedprice contracts 

fixedprice contracts include both “lump sum bid” contracts and “negotiated fixedprice” contracts under lump sum bid contracts we typically bid against other contractors based on specifications the client furnishes this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period additionally it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients which is contrary to our relationshipbased business model accordingly lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract and as such the company has rarely entered into individual lump sum bid contracts that are material to its financial results in contrast under a negotiated fixedprice contract we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client negotiated fixedprice contracts frequently exist in singleresponsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project thus although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us however because of economies that may be realized during the contract term both negotiated fixedprice and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts the company carefully manages the risk inherent in these types of contracts over the past five years most of our fixedprice work has been either negotiated fixedprice contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services rather than turnkey construction

page 12

competition 

with respect to each of the four broad categories of services we provide we compete with a large number of companies across the world typically no single company or companies dominate the market in which we provide any such services we compete based on the following factors among others price of services technical capabilities reputation for quality safety record availability of qualified personnel ability to timely perform work and willingness to accept projectrelated risk for more information regarding the competitive conditions in our business please refer to item 1a— risk factors below

employees 

at september 29 2017 we had approximately 44800 fulltime staff employees including contract staff additionally as of september 29 2017 there were approximately 9900 persons employed in the field on a project basis the number of field employees varies in relation to the number and size of the maintenance and construction projects in progress at any particular time

r isk factors 

tableend

we operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future we may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial if any such events actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected

construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces if we the owner or others working at the project site fail to maintain safe work sites we can be exposed to significant financial losses and reputational harm as well as civil and criminal liabilities

construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment moving vehicles chemical and manufacturing processes and highly regulated materials in a challenging environment and often in geographically remote locations if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective or if others working at the site fail to implement and follow appropriate safety procedures our employees and others may become injured disabled or even lose their lives the completion or commencement of our projects may be delayed and we may be exposed to litigation or investigations unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover increase the cost of a project to our clients and raise our operating and insurance costs any of the foregoing could result in financial losses or reputational harm which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

in addition our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials which if improperly handled or disposed of could subject us to civil andor criminal liabilities we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health safety and environmental “hse” work procedures throughout our organization including construction sites and maintenance sites the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability in addition despite the work of our functional groups we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel or that there will be no damage to or loss of our work equipment or supplies

our safety record is critical to our reputation many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures accordingly if we fail to maintain adequate safety standards we could suffer reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

our vulnerability to the cyclical nature of the sectors and industries in which our clients operate is exacerbated during economic downturns and times of political uncertainty

we provide technical professional construction and om services to clients operating in a number of sectors and industries including oil and gas exploration production and refining programs for various national governments including the us federal government chemicals and polymers mining and minerals pharmaceuticals and biotechnology infrastructure buildings power and other general industrial and consumer businesses and markets such as technology and manufacturing pulp and paper and food and consumer products these sectors and industries and the resulting demand for our services have been and we expect will continue to be cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control including economic conditions and changes in client spending particularly during periods of economic or political uncertainty

current global economic and political conditions have negatively impacted many of our clients’ ability and willingness to fund their projects including their ability to raise capital and pay or timely pay our invoices they have also caused our clients to reduce their capital expenditures alter the mix of services purchased seek more favorable price and other contract terms and otherwise slow their spending on our services for example in the public sector declines in state and local tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending in addition due to these conditions many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable these conditions have reduced and may continue to reduce the demand for our services which has had and may continue to have a significant negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

page 15

current economic and political conditions also make it extremely difficult for our clients our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economi c recovery or downturn worldwide or in our clients’ markets in addition our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and therefore may not recover as quickly as the economy at large a continuation or worsening of current wea k economic conditions a failure to obtain expected benefits from any increased infrastructure spending or a reduction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore  if a significant portion of our clients or projects are concentrated in a specific geographic area or industry our business may be disproportionately affected by negative trends or economic downturns in those specific geographic areas or industries 

regardless of economic or market conditions investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients’ markets and investment decisions as a result our past results have varied and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate

fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers’ investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation delays in existing work or changes in the timing and funding of new awards

commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways for example for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil gas copper or fertilizers fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and therefore their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments furthermore declines in commodity prices can negatively impact our business in regions whose economies are substantially dependent on commodity prices such as the middle east to the extent commodity prices decline or fluctuate and our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects the demand for our services decreases which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned as well as those in progress and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

our project execution activities may result in liability for faulty services

if we fail to provide our services in accordance with applicable professional standards or contractual requirements we could be exposed to significant monetary damages or even criminal violations our engineering practice for example involves professional judgments regarding the planning design development construction operations and management of industrial facilities and public infrastructure projects while we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages in our contracts and although we have adopted a range of insurance risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities a catastrophic event at one of our project sites or completed projects resulting from the services we have performed could result in significant professional or product liability and warranty or other claims against us as well as reputational harm especially if public safety is impacted these liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or the fees we generate may not be covered by insurance at all due to various exclusions in our coverage and could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future further even where coverage applies the policies have deductibles which result in our assumption of exposure for certain amounts with respect to any claim filed against us in addition clients or subcontractors who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us an uninsured claim either in part or in whole as well as any claim covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible if successful and of a material magnitude could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

we engage in a highly competitive business if we are unable to compete effectively we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted

we face intense competition to provide technical professional and construction services to clients the markets we serve are highly competitive and we compete against a large number of regional national and multinational companies 

the extent of our competition varies by industry geographic area and project type for example with respect to our construction and operations and maintenance services clients generally award large projects to large contractors which may 

page 16

give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects conversely with respect to our engineering design architectural and consulting services low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller newer competitors the extent and t ype of competition varies by market and geographic area 

our projects are frequently awarded through a competitive bidding process which is standard in our industry we are constantly competing for project awards based on pricing schedule and the breadth and technical sophistication of our services competition can place downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins and may force us to accept contractual terms and conditions that are less favorable to us thereby increasing the risk that among other things we may not realize profit margins at the same rates as weve seen in the past or may become responsible for costs or other liabilities we have not accepted in the past if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both which if significant could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

our results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the performance of these contracts

our revenues are derived from new contract awards delays in the timing of the awards or cancellations of such prospects as a result of economic conditions material and equipment pricing and availability or other factors could impact our longterm projected results it is particularly difficult to predict whether or when we will receive largescale projects as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process which is affected by a number of factors such as market conditions or governmental and environmental approvals since a significant portion of our revenues is generated from such projects our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards and the commencement or progress of work under awarded contracts furthermore many of these contracts are subject to financing contingencies and as a result we are subject to the risk that the customer will not be able to secure the necessary financing for the project

in addition many of our contracts require us to satisfy specific progress or performance milestones in order to receive payment from the customer as a result we may incur significant costs for engineering materials components equipment labor or subcontractors prior to receipt of payment from a customer 

the uncertainty of our contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs in some cases we maintain and bear the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than necessary under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards if an expected contract award is delayed or not received we may incur additional costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

we are a party to claims and litigation in the normal course of business since we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities and projects where design construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or others we are exposed to substantial claims and litigation and investigations if there is a failure at any such facility or project such claims could relate to among other things personal injury loss of life business interruption property damage pollution and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties such as those who use or reside near our clients’ projects we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met in many of our contracts with clients subcontractors and vendors we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages penalties losses and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts in addition while clients and subcontractors may agree to indemnify us against certain liabilities such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us

we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations our insurance programs have varying coverage limits as well as exclusions for matters such as fraud and insurance companies may attempt to deny claims for which we seek coverage in addition we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles retentions and limits under these programs as a result we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured

although in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future or that such insurance can be economically secured for example 

page 17

catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits coverage that is more limited or increased premium costs or higher deductibles we monitor the financial health of the insurance companies from which we procure insurance an d this is one of the factors we take into account when purchasing insurance our insurance is purchased from a number of the worlds leading providers often in layered insurance or quota share arrangements if any of our third party insurers fail abruptl y cancel our coverage or otherwise cannot satisfy their insurance requirements to us then our overall risk exposure and operational expenses could be increased and our business operations could be interrupted 

in addition the nature of our business sometimes results in clients subcontractors and vendors presenting claims to us for among other things recovery of costs related to certain projects similarly we occasionally present change orders and claims to our clients subcontractors and vendors for among other things additional costs exceeding the original contract price if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients subcontractors and vendors we could incur cost overruns reduced profits or in some cases a loss for a project further these claims can be the subject of lengthy negotiations arbitration or litigation proceedings which could result in the investment of significant amounts of working capital pending the resolution of the relevant change orders and claims a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results additionally irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant

litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability product liability criminal liability warranty obligations default under our credit agreements and other liabilities which to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

the nature of our contracts particularly those that are fixedprice subject us to risks of cost overruns we may experience reduced profits or in some cases losses if costs increase above budgets or estimates or if the project experiences schedule delays

for fiscal 2017 approximately 19 of our revenues were earned under fixedprice contracts both fixedprice and many cost reimbursable contracts require us to estimate the total cost of the project in advance of our performance for fixedprice contracts we may benefit from any costsavings but we bear greater risk of paying some if not all of any cost overruns fixedprice contracts are established in part on partial or incomplete designs cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions including those about future economic conditions commodity and other materials pricing and availability of labor equipment and materials and other exigencies if the design or the estimates prove inaccurate or if circumstances change due to among other things unanticipated technical problems difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals changes in local laws or labor conditions weather or other delays beyond our control changes in the costs of equipment or raw materials our vendors’ or subcontractors’ inability or failure to perform or changes in general economic conditions then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or in some cases a loss for that project these risks are exacerbated for projects with longterm durations because there is an increased risk that the circumstances on which we based our original estimates will change in a manner that increases costs if the project is significant or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

our contracts that are fundamentally cost reimbursable in nature may also present a risk to the extent the final cost on a project exceeds the amount the customer expected or budgeted like fixedprice contracts the expected cost of costreimbursable projects are based in part on partial design and our estimates of the resources and time necessary to perform such contracts a portion of the fee is often linked to the final cost and schedule objectives and if for whatever reason the project may be less profitable than we expect or even result in losses

our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel

the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel including engineers architects designers craft personnel and corporate management professionals who have the required experience and expertise at a reasonable cost the market for these and other personnel is competitive from time to time it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients or to replace such personnel when needed in a timely manner in certain geographic areas for example we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel furthermore some of our personnel hold government granted clearance that may be required to obtain government projects if we were to 

page 18

lose some or all of these personnel they would be difficult to replace loss of the services of or failure to recruit qualified technical and management personnel could limit our ability to successfully complete existing projects and compete for new projects 

in addition in the event that any of our key personnel retire or otherwise leave the company we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans which requires devoting time and resources toward identifying and integrating new personnel into leadership roles and other key positions if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

the cost of providing our services including the extent to which we utilize our workforce affects our profitability for example the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts if an expected contract award is delayed or not received we could incur costs resulting from excess staff reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business financial conditions and results of operations

the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted cancelled or suspended by our clients and therefore our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings additionally even if fully performed our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins

backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us as of the end of fiscal 2017 our backlog totaled approximately 198 billion there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or if realized will result in profits in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation termination or suspension at the discretion of the client in the event of a project cancellation we would generally have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns or in response to changes in commodity prices

the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts the revenue for certain contracts included in backlog is based on estimates additionally the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence future profitability

in some markets there is a continuing trend towards costreimbursable contracts with incentivefee arrangements typically our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs overall safety performance overall client satisfaction and other performance criteria if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards we may receive a lower or even zero incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins accordingly there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog assuming they produce the revenues currently expected will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies which are a significant source of our revenue and profit are subject to various uncertainties restrictions and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities as well as profit and cost controls which could result in withholding or delay of payments to us government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding such as sequestration and budget deficits contracts with the us federal government for example are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for government programs may even be eliminated legislatures typically appropriate funds on a yearbyyear basis while contract performance may take more than one year as a result contracts with government agencies may be only partially funded or may be terminated and we may not realize all of the potential revenue and profit from those contracts

our government clients may reduce the scope or terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues for example those with the us federal government represented approximately 192 of our total revenue in fiscal 2017 a 

page 19

significant reduction in government funding or the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and resul ts of operations 

most government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process the us federal government has increasingly relied upon multipleyear contracts with multiple contractors that generally require those contractors to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under a contract this process may result in us facing significant additional pricing pressure and uncertainty and incurring additional costs moreover we may not be awarded government contracts because of existing policies designed to protect small businesses and underrepresented minorities our inability to win new contracts or be awarded work under existing contracts could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations

in addition government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socioeconomic requirements which affect how we transact business with our clients and in some instances impose additional costs on our business operations for example for contracts with the us federal government we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation the truth in negotiations act the cost accounting standards the service contract act and numerous regulations governing environmental protection and employment practices government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than nongovernment contracts this includes for example unlimited indemnification obligations

we also are subject to government audits investigations and proceedings for example government agencies such as the us defense contract audit agency routinely review and audit us to determine the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies and whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations these audits can result in a determination that a rule or regulation has been violated or that adjustments are necessary to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies

if we violate a rule or regulation fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit a variety of penalties can be imposed on us including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties for example in socalled “qui tam” actions brought by individuals or the government under the us federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws treble damages can be awarded in addition any or all of our government contracts could be terminated we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work or payment of our costs could be disallowed the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted

many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances which can be difficult and time consuming to obtain if our employees are unable to obtain or retain the necessary securities clearances our clients could terminate or not renew existing contracts or award us new contracts to the extent this occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted

our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control

as is common in our industry we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures partnerships and similar arrangements this situation exposes us to a number of risks including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients

further we have limited ability to control the actions of our joint venture partners including with respect to nonperformance default bankruptcy or legal or regulatory compliance our partners may be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships if these circumstances occur we may be liable for claims and losses attributable to the partner by operation of law or contract these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend on the management effectiveness of our joint venture partners differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major issues which could materially affect the business and operations of these ventures in addition in many of the countries in which we engage in joint ventures it may be difficult to enforce our contractual rights under the applicable joint venture agreement if we are not able to enforce our contractual rights we may not be able to realize the benefits of the joint venture or we may be subject to additional liabilities

page 20

we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner in these cases we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow to the extent the contro lling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the failure by a joint venture partner to comply with applicable laws regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and for government clients could result in fines penalties suspension or even debarment being imposed on us which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts

thirdparty subcontractors we hire perform much of the work performed under our contracts we also rely on thirdparty equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired if we are not able to locate qualified thirdparty subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated especially in a lump sum or a fixedprice contract we may suffer losses on these contracts if a subcontractor supplier or manufacturer fails to provide services supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason we may be required to source these services equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms which could impact contract profitability there is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors relating to among other things the quality and timeliness of work performed customer concerns about the subcontractor or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a contract in addition faulty workmanship equipment or materials could impact the overall project resulting in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications

in the current economic environment third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party’s ability to provide materials equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a failure by a third party subcontractor supplier or manufacturer to comply with applicable laws regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and for government clients could result in fines penalties suspension or even debarment being imposed on us which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

negative conditions in the credit and financial markets and delays in receiving client payments could result in liquidity problems adversely affecting our cost of borrowing and our business

although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions instability in the credit markets in the us or abroad could cause the availability of credit to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain at competitive rates on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts this situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds refinance our existing indebtedness enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all we may also enter into business acquisition agreements that require us to access credit which if not available at the closing of the acquisition could result in a breach of the acquisition agreement and a resulting claim for damages by the sellers of such business in addition market conditions could negatively impact our clients’ ability to fund their projects and therefore utilize our services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

in addition we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors suppliers and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements on less favorable terms with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations

page 21

some of our customers suppliers and subcontractors depend on access to commercial financing and capital markets to fund their operations disruptions of the credit or capital markets could adversely affect our clients’ ability to finance projects and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions project delays and payment delays or defaults by our clients in addition clients may be unable to fund new projects  may choose to make fewer capital expenditures or otherwise slow their spending on our services or to seek contract terms more favorable to them our government clients may face budget deficits that prohibit them from funding proposed and existing project s or that cause them to exercise their right to terminate our contracts with little or no prior notice in addition any financial difficulties suffered by our subcontractors or suppliers could increase our cost or adversely impact project schedules these disruptions could materially impact our backlog and have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are therefore subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices after we have already committed resources to their projects in weak economic environments we may experience increased delays and failures due to among other reasons our clients’ unwillingness to pay for alleged poor performance or to preserve their own working capital if one or more clients delays in paying or fails to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations

furthermore our cash balances and shortterm investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america europe south america australia and asia some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership or have been seized by their governments there is a risk that such events may occur in the future if any such events were to occur we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

maintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts

in line with industry practice we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds or letters of credit to our customers these instruments indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract if a bond or a letter of credit is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond or letter of credit we cannot pursue that project historically we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity but as is typically the case the issuance of a bond is at the surety’s sole discretion and the issuance of a letter of credit is based on the companys creditworthiness because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms in addition future projects may require us to obtain letters of credit that extend beyond the term of our existing credit facilities our inability to obtain adequate bonding and as a result to bid on new contracts that require such bonding or letter of credit could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

past and future environmental heath and safety laws could impose significant additional costs and liabilities

we are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities

various us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants the liability under these laws is joint and several we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen cleanup obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations

page 22

when we perform our services our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions we may be subject to liability claims by employ ees customers and third parties as a result of such exposures in addition we may be subject to fines penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws a claim if not covered or only partially covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

health safety and environmental laws and regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes thereto could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could for example relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and in turn could negatively impact our revenue changes in the environmental laws and regulations remediation obligations enforcement actions stricter interpretations of existing requirements future discovery of contamination or claims for damages to persons property natural resources or the environment could result in material costs and liabilities that we currently do not anticipate if we fail to comply with any environmental health or safety laws or regulations whether actual or alleged we could be exposed to fines penalties or potential litigation liabilities including costs settlements and judgments any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

in addition we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments which may require us or our clients to obtain and to comply with federal state and local government permits and approvals any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial revocation or modification under various circumstances failure to obtain or comply with or the loss or modification of the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and result of operations

if we fail to comply with federal state local or foreign governmental requirements our business may be adversely affected

we are subject to us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business for example our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders which requires full compliance with both export regulatory laws and international trafficking in arms regulations “itar” although we have policies and procedures to comply with us and foreign international trade laws the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges or debarment from participation in us government contracts and could damage our reputation and our ability to do business

employee agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts which could result in reduced revenues and profits

misconduct fraud noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or other improper activities by one of our employees agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations regulations regarding the protection of classified information regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts regulations on lobbying or similar activities regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting regulations pertaining to export control environmental laws and any other applicable laws or regulations for example we routinely provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters if a security breach were to occur our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective and we could face unknown risks or losses our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties cancellation of contracts loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws

the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act of 2010 and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict 

page 23

with local custom s and practices despite our training and compliance programs there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions including contract cancellations or debarment and loss of reputation any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the loss of or a significant reduction in business from one or a few customers could have a material adverse impact on us

a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue andor backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years for example in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 approximately 192 214 and 217 respectively of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government although we have longstanding relationships with many of our significant clients our clients may unilaterally reduce delay or cancel their contracts at any time our loss of or a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

our international operations are exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies

for fiscal 2017 approximately 42 of our revenue was earned from clients outside the us our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues our international operations are subject to a variety of risks including





































the lack of a welldeveloped legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights in addition military action or continued unrest particularly in the middle east could impact the supply or pricing of oil disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere and increase our security costs to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic political and other conditions our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected

page 24

we work in international locations where there are high security risks which could result in harm to our employees or unanticipated cost 

some of our services are performed in highrisk locations where the country or location is subject to political social or economic risks or war or civil unrest in those locations where we have employees or operations we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel despite these activities in these locations we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel and we may suffer future losses of employees and subcontractors acts of terrorism and threats of armed conflicts in or around various areas in which we operate could limit or disrupt markets and our operations including disruptions resulting from the evacuation of personnel cancellation of contracts or the loss of key employees contractors or assets

foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects

our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects both positive and negative that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar into the us dollar while we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in the currencies of our expenditures we do enter into contracts that expose us to currency risk particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs we attempt to minimize our exposure from currency risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies or entering into derivative hedging instruments when there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts these actions however may not always eliminate currency risk exposure the governments of certain countries have or may in the future impose restrictive exchange controls on local currencies and it may not be possible for us to engage in effective hedging transactions to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in a particular currency based on fluctuations in currency the us dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly we may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries

our operations may be impacted by the united kingdom’s proposed exit from the european union

in june 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the uk’s exit from the eu there may be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the uk and eu countries and increased regulatory complexities these changes may adversely affect our relationships with our existing and future customers suppliers employees and subcontractors or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the ongoing negotiations between the uk and the eu as to the terms upon which the uk will exit from the eu and the uncertainty as to their future trade agreement continues to create economic uncertainty which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs terminate or reduce the scope of existing contracts decrease or postpone currently planned contracts or negotiate for more favorable deal terms each of which may have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties

our business strategy involves growth through among other things the acquisition of other companies acquiring companies presents a number of risks including















page 25













while we may obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses such rights may be difficult to enforce the losses may exceed any dedicated escrow funds and the indemnitors may not have the ability to financially support the indemnity

if our management is unable to successfully integrate acquired companies or implement our growth strategy our operating results could be harmed in addition even if the operations of an acquisition are integrated successfully we may not realize the full benefits of an acquisition including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all moreover we cannot assure that we will continue to successfully expand or that growth or expansion will result in profitability

in addition there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us existing cash balances and cash flow from operations together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities may be insufficient to make acquisitions future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing which may not be available on attractive terms or at all acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced

in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make we could dilute share ownership

one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities if we issue additional equity securities as is contemplated for example in connection with the merger such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders’ individual ownership percentages in the company

there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends on our common stock

our board of directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program in fiscal 2017 under which we have paid and intend to continue paying a regular quarterly dividend the declaration amount and timing of such dividends are subject to capital availability and determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all respective laws and our agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends our ability to pay dividends will depend upon among other factors our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions including acquisitions debt service requirements results of operations financial condition and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant a reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments andor our dividend program could have a material negative effect on our stock price

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock fluctuations are caused by a number of factors including





page 26

























our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements

in preparing our financial statements our management is required under us gaap to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities areas requiring significant estimates by our management include





















our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations

an impairment charge on our goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations

because we have grown in part through acquisitions goodwill and intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets under us gaap we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach as of september 29 2017 we had 30 billion of goodwill representing 408 of our total assets of 74 billion we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained 

page 27

decline in a reporting unit’s market value legal factors operating perfo rmance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business potential government actions toward our facilities and other factors 

if our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value we could be required to record an impairment charge the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing please see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below

we may be required to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and postretirement benefit plans we manage

we have various employee benefit plan obligations that require us to make contributions to satisfy over time our underfunded benefit obligations which are generally determined by calculating the projected benefit obligations minus the fair value of plan assets for example as of september 29 2017 and september 30 2016 our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by 2520 million and 4031 million respectively see note 7 pension plans and other postretirement plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k for additional disclosure in the future our benefit plan obligations may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of interest rates pension plan asset performance and other factors if we are required to contribute a significant amount of the deficit for underfunded benefit plans our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected

rising inflation interest rates andor construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts in particular with respect to our fixedprice contracts

rising inflation interest rates or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services in addition we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixedprice because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from costreimbursable type contracts approximately 81 during fiscal 2017 the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor however if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixedprice and lumpsum work is more prevalent inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future therefore increases in inflation interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

we may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change

growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations legislation international protocols regulation or other restrictions on emissions could result in increased compliance costs for us and our clients and have other impacts on our clients including those who are involved in the exploration production or refining of fossil fuels emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels or emit greenhouse gases through the mining manufacture utilization or production of materials or goods such policy changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or in some cases prevent a project from going forward thereby potentially reducing the need for our services which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations however these changes could also increase the pace of projects such as carbon capture or storage projects that could have a positive impact on our business we cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers

our effective tax rate may increase or decrease

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation the introduction of new tax accounting standards legislation regulations and related interpretations our global mix of earnings the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate or an ultimate determination that the company owes more taxes than the amounts previously accrued could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations

page 28

systems and information technology interruption or failure and data security breaches could adversely impact our ability to operate or expose us to significant financial losses and reputational harm 

we rely heavily on computer information and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business from time to time we experience occasional system interruptions and delays in the event we are unable to regularly deploy software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems the operation of such systems could be interrupted or result in the loss corruption or release of data in addition our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters force majeure events telecommunications failures power loss acts of war or terrorism computer viruses malicious code physical or electronic security breaches intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error or similar events or disruptions any of these or other events could cause interruptions delays loss of critical andor sensitive data or similar effects which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition protection of intellectual property and results of operations as well as those of our clients

in addition we face the threat to our computer systems of unauthorized access computer hackers computer viruses malicious code organized cyberattacks and other security problems and system disruptions including possible unauthorized access to and disclosure of our and our clients’ proprietary or classified information as part of our ongoing effort to utilize industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain all confidential and proprietary information on our computer systems we have observed increased threat activity to our computer systems and have identified instances of unauthorized access to certain of our computer systems occurring in the 20142016 timeframe in response we are conducting an ongoing internal investigation with the assistance of outside counsel and technical experts to identify and remediate the source and impact of these incursions as well as comply with related notification and disclosure obligations expenses incurred to date related to this matter have not been material we will incur additional expenses and may incur losses in connection with this matter which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial conditions results of operations and cash flows however at this time we are unable to reasonably estimate any such additional expenses or losses 

 

while we have security measures and technology in place to protect our and our clients’ proprietary or classified information if these measures fail as a result of a cyberattack other thirdparty action employee error malfeasance or otherwise and someone obtains unauthorized access to our or our clients’ information our reputation could be damaged our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures as a result we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of system disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these disruptions and breaches any of these events could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

we continuously evaluate the need to upgrade andor replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our computing environment to stay current on vendor supported products and to improve the efficiency of our systems and for other business reasons the implementation of new systems and information technology could adversely impact our operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems and our systems implementations may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated systems implementation disruption and any other information technology disruption if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have an adverse effect on our business

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or that of our clients

our technology and intellectual property provide us in certain instances with a competitive advantage although we protect our property through patent registrations license restrictions and similar mechanisms we may not be able to successfully preserve our rights and they could be invalidated circumvented challenged or become obsolete our employees and contractors are subject to confidentiality obligations but this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information andor infringement of our intellectual property in addition the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the us if we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights even if ultimately successful could be costly and could divert management’s attention away from other aspects of our business

page 29

we also hold licenses from third partie s which may be utilized in our business operations if we are no longer able to license such technology on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise our business and financial performance could be adversely affected 

if our intellectual property rights or work processes become obsolete we may not be able to differentiate our service offerings and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers our competitors may independently attempt to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies

our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property there is a risk we may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and as a result could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities loss of contracts or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control

extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control such as natural or manmade disasters could negatively impact our ability to operate as an example from time to time we face unexpected severe weather conditions which may result in weatherrelated delays that are not always reimbursable under a fixedprice contract evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services increased labor and material costs in areas resulting from weatherrelated damage and subsequent increased demand for labor and materials for repairing and rebuilding inability to deliver materials equipment and personnel to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules and loss of productivity we may remain obligated to perform our services after any such natural or manmade event unless a force majeure clause or other contractual provision provides us with relief from our contractual obligations if we are not able to react quickly to such events or if a high concentration of our projects are in a specific geographic region that suffers from a natural or manmade catastrophe our operations may be significantly affected which could have a negative impact on our operations in addition if we cannot complete our contracts on time we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients which may reduce our profits

we are subject to professional standards duties and statutory obligations on professional reports and opinions we issue which could subject us to monetary damages

we issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional engineering expertise as well as our other professional credentials that subject us to professional standards duties and obligations regulating the performance of our services for example we issue opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings if a client or another third party alleges that our report or opinion is incorrect or it is improperly relied upon and we are held responsible we could be subject to significant monetary damages in addition our reports and other work product may need to comply with professional standards licensing requirements securities regulations and other laws and rules governing the performance of professional services in the jurisdiction where the services are performed we could be liable to third parties who use or rely upon our reports and other work product even if we are not contractually bound to those third parties these events could in turn result in monetary damages and penalties

delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control

we are a delaware corporation certain antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us in addition certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover for example







these types of provisions as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders accordingly shareholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares

page 30

fail ure of the merger to be consummated the termination of the merger agreement or a significant delay in the consummation of the merger could negatively affect our stock price and our future business and financial results 

 

our obligations and ch2m’s obligations to consummate the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions including but not limited to i the approval of the merger agreement by the ch2m stockholders ii the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods under or receipt of the applicable consents required under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended and certain foreign antitrust and competition laws each of which have been satisfied or obtained iii the absence of any order applicable law or other legal restraints of certain specified governmental authorities enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the merger iv the accuracy of certain representations and warranties of each of the parties contained in the merger agreement subject to specified materiality qualifications v compliance in all material respects by each of the parties with their respective covenants contained in the merger agreement vi the effectiveness of the registration statement on form s4 filed by the company for the issuance of the company common stock in the merger which was satisfied on november 9 2017 and the approval of the listing of such shares on the new york stock exchange vii the absence of a material adverse effect on either ch2m or the company since the date of the merger agreement and viii the other conditions set forth in the merger agreement there can be no assurance that these conditions to the consummation of the merger will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all in addition other factors such as jacobs’ ability to obtain the debt financing it needs to consummate the merger or legal proceedings related to the merger may affect when and whether the merger will occur

 

if the merger is not consummated or is delayed our ongoing business financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the market price of our common stock may decline significantly particularly to the extent that the market price reflects a market assumption that the merger will be consummated or will be consummated on a particular timeframe in addition we and our subsidiaries may experience negative reactions from our respective clients regulators vendors and employees 

 

furthermore we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial expenses in connection with the completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement if the merger is not consummated we will have paid these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the transaction any of the foregoing or other risks arising in connection with a failure or delay in consummating the merger including the diversion of management attention or loss of other opportunities during the pendency of the merger could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

if jacobs’ financing for the merger becomes unavailable the merger may not be completed 

jacobs intends to finance the cash component of the consideration payable to ch2m stockholders in the merger the repayment of ch2m’s outstanding indebtedness and other transaction expenses with a combination of cash on hand and debt financing which includes the jacobs term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 15 billion and additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility jacobs currently estimates that the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness to be incurred in connection with the merger will be approximately 19 billion there are a number of conditions in the jacobs term loan credit agreement and the revolving credit facility that must be satisfied or waived in order for closing of the debt financing to occur there is a risk that these conditions will not be satisfied in the event that the financing contemplated by the jacobs term loan credit agreement and the revolving credit facility is not available jacobs may obtain alternative financing to finance the consideration payable to ch2m stockholders in the merger the repayment of ch2m’s outstanding indebtedness and other transaction expenses such alternative financing may not be available on acceptable terms in a timely manner or at all while obtaining financing is not a condition to jacobs’ obligation to effect the merger if other financing becomes necessary and jacobs is unable to secure such other financing the merger may not be completed 

the merger may adversely affect the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation 

if the merger is completed it may give rise to unexpected liabilities and costs including costs associated with the defense and resolution of possible litigation or other claims and may have an adverse effect on any pending claims against jacobs or ch2m jacobs could also be subject to claims or litigation related to the merger whether or not the merger is consummated such actions may create additional uncertainty relating to the merger and responding to such claims and defending such actions may be costly and distracting to management

 

page 31

the current ownership and voting interests of jacobs stockholders will be diluted by the merger 

upon the completion of the merger except for stockholders who own stock in both jacobs and ch2m each jacobs stockholder will have a percentage ownership of jacobs that is smaller than such stockholder’s current percentage ownership of jacobs because of this jacobs stockholders will generally have less influence on the management and policies of the combined company than they now have on the management and policies of jacobs if the combined company is unable to realize the full strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the merger jacobs stockholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests in their respective companies without receiving any commensurate benefit or only receiving part of the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the merger 

 

the combined company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger

 

the success of the merger will depend on among other things the combined company’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining jacobs’ and ch2m’s businesses including achieving cost savings and operating synergies the combined company’s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger will depend to a large extent on the ability of jacobs to integrate the businesses of ch2m with jacobs the combination of two independent companies is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result the combined company will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of jacobs and ch2m the integration process may disrupt the business of either or both of the companies and if implemented ineffectively could preclude or delay the realization of the full benefits expected by jacobs the failure of the combined company to meet the challenges involved in integrating successfully the operations of jacobs and ch2m or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in the activities of the combined company and could seriously harm its results of operations in addition the overall integration of the two companies may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses loss of client relationships and diversion of management’s attention and may cause the combined company’s stock price to decline

 

the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include among others

 





























many of these factors will be outside of jacobs’ and the combined company’s control and any one of them could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially impact jacobs’ and the combined company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition even if the operations of jacobs and ch2m are integrated successfully the combined company may not realize the full benefits of the proposed transactions including the synergies cost savings or growth opportunities that the combined company expects these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all as a result there 

page 32

can be no assurance that the merger will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement 

 

we will be subject to business uncertainties while the merger is pending and following the combination

 

uncertainty about the effect of the merger on jacobs’ employees and business relationships may have an adverse effect on jacobs and on the combined company following the closing of the merger our continued success depends in part upon our ability to retain the talents and dedication of our key employees and the ability of the combined company to retain the talents and dedication of ch2m’s key employees employees may decide not to remain with the company or ch2m as applicable while the merger is pending if key employees terminate their employment or if an insufficient number of employees are retained to maintain effective operations our business activities may be adversely affected and managements attention may be diverted from successfully managing our business to hiring suitable replacements any of which factors may cause our business to deteriorate in addition we or ch2m may not be able to motivate certain key employees during the pendency of the merger due to a perceived lack of appropriate opportunities for advancement or other reasons 

 

in addition uncertainties during the pendency of the merger may cause third parties who deal with the company andor ch2m to seek to change existing business relationships with us or ch2m moreover customers’ uncertainty about the effect of the merger including the perception of potential conflicts of interest with respect to projects where ch2m assumes or will assume a project role and jacobs assumes or will assume a delivery role and vice versa may have an adverse effect on the ability of jacobs andor ch2m to attract or retain customers or to win customer contracts 

 

in addition competitors may target the company’s or ch2m’s clients by highlighting potential uncertainties and integration difficulties that may result from the merger the pursuit of the merger and the preparation for the integration will require management attention and use of internal resources any significant diversion of management attention away from ongoing business concerns and any business difficulties resulting from the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

 

during the pendency of the merger and following the merger our operating results and share price may be volatile which could cause the value of our stockholder’s investments to decline

 

during the pendency of the merger and following the merger our quarterly and annual operating results as well as our stock price may fluctuate and such fluctuations may be significant such fluctuations may occur due to the accretion or anticipated accretion of the value of the merger the progress and success of the integration process or the perception of such progress or success additions or departures of key personnel or sales of large blocks of stock or the perception that such sales may occur

jacobs expects to incur substantial indebtedness to finance the merger which may decrease jacobs’ business flexibility and could adversely impact jacobs’ financial condition and results of operations 

 

in addition to using cash on hand at jacobs and ch2m jacobs intends to finance the cash component of the consideration payable to the ch2m stockholders in the merger the repayment of ch2m’s outstanding indebtedness and other transaction expenses with debt financing which includes the jacobs term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 15 billion and additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility jacobs currently estimates that the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness to be incurred in connection with the merger will be approximately 19 billion the financial and other covenants to which jacobs has agreed to or may agree to in connection with the incurrence of new indebtedness and the combined company’s increased indebtedness may have the effect among other things of reducing the combined company’s flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions thereby placing the combined company at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness and making the combined company more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions the combined company’s increased indebtedness will also increase borrowing costs and the covenants pertaining thereto may also limit the combined company’s ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or general corporate requirements the combined company will also be required to dedicate a larger portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of its cash flow for other purposes including working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes in addition the terms and conditions of such debt may not be favorable to the combined company and as such could further increase the costs of the merger as well as the overall burden of such debt upon the combined company and the combined company’s business flexibility further the combined company will be exposed to the risk of increased interest rates as a result of i higher leverage at or after the closing of the merger and 

page 33

ii unless the combined company enters into offsetting hedging transactions interest rates that vary based on libor or a bank’s prime rate 

the combined company’s ability to make payments on and to refinance its debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on its ability to generate cash from the combined company’s operations this to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond the combined company’s control 

the combined company may not be able to refinance any of its indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all if the combined company cannot service its indebtedness the combined company may have to take actions such as selling assets selling additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures strategic acquisitions investments or alliances any of which could impede the implementation of the combined company’s business strategy or prevent the combined company from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit its business additionally the combined company may not be able to effect such actions if necessary on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

any of the foregoing consequences could adversely affect the combined company’s financial condition or results of operations

critical accounting policies and estimates

in order to understand better the changes that occur to key elements of our financial condition results of operations and cash flows a reader of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements

the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business performing longterm engineering and constructiontype contracts requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect both the entity’s results of operations and the carrying values of its assets and liabilities although our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 – significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k the following discussion is intended to highlight and describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

revenue accounting for contracts and use of joint ventures  we recognize revenue earned on our technical professional and field services projects under the percentageofcompletion method described in asc 60535 constructiontype and productiontype contracts in general we recognize revenues at the time we provide services precontract costs are generally expensed as incurred contracts are generally segmented between types of services such as project services and construction and accordingly gross margin related to each activity is recognized as those separate services are rendered for multiple contracts with a single customer we account for each contract separately 

the percentageofcompletion method of accounting is applied by comparing contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion on costreimbursable contracts the cost of materials and subcontracts are generally excluded from the calculation of the measure of progress towards completion to provide a more meaningful allocation of income contract losses are provided for in their entirety in the period they become known without regard to the percentageofcompletion

unapproved change orders are included in the contract price to the extent it is probable that such change orders will result in additional contract revenue and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated claims meeting these recognition criteria are included in revenues only to the extent of the related costs incurred

certain costreimbursable contracts include incentivefee arrangements these incentive fees can be based on a variety of factors but the most common are the achievement of target completion dates target costs andor other performance criteria failure to meet these targets can result in unrealized incentive fees we recognize incentive fees based on expected results using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting as the contract progresses and more information becomes available the estimate of the anticipated incentive fee that will be earned is revised as necessary we bill incentive fees based on the terms and conditions of the individual contracts in certain situations we are allowed to bill a portion of the incentive fees over the performance period of the contract in other situations we are allowed to bill incentive fees only after the target criterion has been achieved incentive fees which have been recognized but not billed are included in receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets

certain costreimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment in this situation revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts revenues are not recognized for nonrecoverable costs in those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs not allowable under the terms of the contract we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly

when we are directly responsible for subcontractor labor or thirdparty materials and equipment we reflect the costs of such items in both revenues and costs and we refer to such costs as “passthrough” costs on those projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs

as is common to the industry we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures and consortiums although the joint ventures own and hold the contracts with the clients the services required by the contracts are typically performed by us and our joint venture partners or by other subcontractors under subcontracting agreements with the joint ventures the assets of our joint ventures therefore consist almost entirely of cash and receivables 

page 38

representing amounts due f rom clients and the liabilities of our joint ventures consist almost entirely of amounts due to the joint venture partners for services provided by the partners to the joint ventures under their individual subcontracts and other subcontractors in gene ral at any given time the equity of our joint ventures represents the undistributed profits earned on contracts the joint ventures hold with clients very few of our joint ventures have employees none of our joint ventures have thirdparty debt or credi t facilities under us gaap our share of profits and losses associated with the contracts held by the joint ventures is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

certain of our joint ventures meet the definition of a vie in evaluating our vies for possible consolidation we perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether or not we have a “controlling financial interest” in the vie as defined by us gaap we consolidate only those vies over which we have a controlling financial interest and are the primary beneficiary

for the company’s unconsolidated joint ventures we use either the equity method of accounting or proportional consolidation 

there were no changes in facts and circumstances during the period that caused the company to reassess the method of accounting for its vies

accounting for stock issued to employees and others — we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the estimated grantdate fair value of the award we estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors using the blackscholes optionpricing model like all optionpricing models the blackscholes model requires the use of subjective assumptions including i the expected volatility of the market price of the underlying stock and ii the expected term of the award among others accordingly changes in assumptions and any subsequent adjustments to those assumptions can cause different fair values to be assigned to our stock option awards for restricted stock units containing service and performance conditions with measures external to the company compensation expense is based on the fair value of such units determined using monte carlo simulations 

accounting for pension plans — the accounting for pension plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans’ assets and liabilities these assumptions include discount rates investment returns and projected salary increases among others the actuarial assumptions used in determining the funded statuses of the plans are provided in note 7 – pension and other postretirement benefit plans of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

the expected rates of return on plan assets for fiscal 2018 range from 35 to 85 which is the same for the fiscal 2017 we believe the range of rates selected for fiscal 2018 reflects the longterm returns expected on the plans’ assets considering recent market conditions projected rates of inflation the diversification of the plans’ assets and the expected real rates of market returns the discount rates used to compute plan liabilities were changed from a range of 07 to 70 in fiscal 2016 to a range of 13 to 70 in fiscal 2017 these assumptions represent the company’s best estimate of the rates at which its pension obligations could be effectively settled

changes in the actuarial assumptions often have a material effect on the values assigned to plan assets and liabilities and the associated pension expense for example if the discount rate used to value the net pension benefit obligation “pbo” at september 30 2017 was higher lower by 05 the pbo would have been lower higher at that date by approximately 1197 million for nonus plans and by approximately 73 million for us plans if the expected return on plan assets was higher lower by 10 the net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2017 would be lower higher by approximately 107 million for nonus plans and by approximately 13 million for us plans differences between actuarial assumptions and actual performance ie actuarial gains and losses that are not recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost in the period in which such differences arise are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are recognized as part of net periodic pension cost in future periods in accordance with us gaap management monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in an effort to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used

contractual guarantees litigation investigations and insurance — in the normal course of business we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation the guarantees to which we are a party generally relate to project schedules and plant performance most of the litigation in which we are involved has us as a defendant in workers’ compensation personal injury environmental employmentlabor professional liability and other similar lawsuits we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations we have elected however to retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under our insurance programs in addition our insurance 

page 39

policies may contain exclusions for certain matters and insurance companies may seek t o deny coverage for claims against us this situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured and we intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business j udgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of our contracts 

in accordance with us gaap we record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such guarantees litigation and insurance claims we include any adjustments to such liabilities in our consolidated results of operations

in addition as a contractor providing services to the us federal government and several of its agencies we are subject to many levels of audits investigations and claims by or on behalf of the us federal government with respect to contract performance pricing costs cost allocations and procurement practices we adjust revenues based upon the amounts we expect to realize considering the effects of any client audits or governmental investigations

testing goodwill for possible impairment — the goodwill carried on our consolidated balance sheets is tested annually for possible impairment in performing the annual impairment test we evaluate our goodwill at the reporting unit level the company performs the annual goodwill impairment test for the reporting units at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year the company will test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we reorganized our operations around four global lines of business which also serve as our operating segments petroleum  chemicals buildings  infrastructure aerospace  technology and industrial we determined that this new organization would better support the needs of managing each unique set of customers that fall within each segment as a result of the new organization we subsequently realigned our internal reporting structures to enable our chief executive officer who is also our chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of each of these segments and make appropriate resource allocations among each of the segments for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing we have determined that our operating segments are also our reporting units based on management’s conclusion that the components comprising each of our operating segments share similar economic characteristics and meet the aggregation criteria in accordance with asc 350

us gaap does not prescribe a specific valuation method for estimating the fair value of reporting units any valuation technique used to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including revenue growth rates operating margins discount rates and future market conditions among others

we used both an income approach and a market approach to test our goodwill for possible impairment such approaches require us to make estimates and judgments under the income approach fair value is determined by using the discounted cash flows of our reporting units the company ’ s discount rate reflects a weighted average cost of capital  “ wacc ”  for a peer group of companies representative of the company’s respective reporting units under the market approach the fair value of our reporting units is determined by reference to guideline companies that are reasonably comparable to our reporting units the fair values are estimated based on the valuation multiples of the invested capital associated with the guideline companies in assessing whether there is an indication that the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired we utilize the results of both valuation techniques and consider the range of fair values indicated the fair values for each reporting unit exceeded the respective book values ranging from 27 to 110

it is possible that changes in market conditions economy facts and circumstances judgments and assumptions used in estimating the fair value could change resulting in possible impairment of goodwill in the future the fair values resulting from the valuation techniques used are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of the reporting units to willing third parties

in performing the company’s annual impairment test as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2017 t he company performed a qualitative assessment and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts as a result the company is not required to proceed to a quantitative impairment assessment 

we have determined that the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values for the consolidated balance sheets presented

restructuring and other charges 

during the second fiscal quarter of 2015 the company began implementing a series of initiatives intended to improve operational efficiency reduce costs and better position itself to drive growth of the business in the future we refer to these initiatives in the aggregate as the 2015 restructuring these activities evolved and developed over time as management identified and evaluated opportunities for changes in the company’s operations and related areas of potential cost savings as economic conditions changed and as the realignment of the company’s operations into its four global lines of business was implemented actions related to the 2015 restructuring include involuntary terminations the abandonment of certain leased offices combining operational organizations and the colocation of employees into other existing offices we did not exit any service types or client endmarkets in connection with the 2015 restructuring 

the majority of the costs associated with the 2015 restructuring are included in sga expense in the consolidated statements of earnings the following table summarizes the impact of the 2015 restructuring for the years ended september 29 2017 september 30 2016 and october 2 2015 in thousands

 



 

the 2015 restructuring was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 with the results of this program generally being in line with management’s expectations the company expects annual savings from the 2015 restructuring to be approximately 285 million per year 

 

during the second fiscal quarter of 2017 the company entered into strategic business restructuring activities associated with realignment of its europe uk and middle east regional operations in our buildings  infrastructure segment pretax net charges of 226 million were recorded associated mainly with net realizable value writeoffs on contract accounts receivable of 165 million with additional charges recorded for statutory redundancy and severance costs of 14 million and other liabilities of 47 million which are both expected to be paid or settled within fiscal 2018 additional charges of 12 million were recorded under this business exit during third quarter fiscal 2017 associated mainly with contract accounts receivable charges further management has determined that these business restructuring activities do not qualify for discontinued operations treatment in accordance with us gaap as the associated businesses were not material

during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 the company implemented certain restructuring activities primarily severance related activities associated with the company’s announced definitive agreement to acquire ch2m as well as final charges recognized in connection with the completion of the 2015 restructuring approximately 136 million or 011 per diluted share of after tax charges were recorded in association with these activities

collectively the 2015 restructuring and the above mentioned restructuring activities are referred to as “restructuring and other charges” 

also our fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 included aftertax charges of 106 million or 009 per diluted share in professional fees and related costs associated with the pending ch2m acquisition

2017 overview 

 

the companys net earnings for fiscal 2017 were 2937 million an increase of 833 million or 396 when compared to fiscal 2016 the company’s results for the current year when compared to the prior year were favorably impacted by improving gross margins based on benefits from our improvements in project execution and favorable mix our results were also favorably affected by lower sga of 492 million year over year due largely to lower costs from our 2015 restructuring initiatives which concluded at the end of fiscal 2017 with resulting ongoing savings from these initatives helping offset higher personnel related costs and professional services our fiscal 2017 results were also favorably impacted in comparision to 2016 by an 11 million pre tax gain on the sale of our neste jacobs jv combined with the non recurrence of 2016 charges associated with the loss on sale of our french subsidiary of 244 million and the noncash writeoff on an equity investment of 17 million income taxes for fiscal 2017 were higher by 336 million due mainly to higher pretax income

backlog at september 29 2017 was 198 billion up 10 billion over 2016 and a record level for the company new prospects and new sales remain strong and the company continues to have a positive outlook for many of the industry groups and markets in which our clients operate 

 

on december 1 2016 the company announced the approval of a cash dividend program quarterly dividends of 015 per share were paid in each of the second third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017 on september 27 2017 the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 015 per share which was paid on november 10 2017 also the company repurchased and retired 20 million shares of its common stock under its share repurchase program for 972 million 

results of operations 

fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016

total revenues for the year ended september 29 2017 were 1002 billion a decrease of 9414 million or 86 from 1096 billion for the corresponding period last year the decrease in revenues was due primarily to lower volumes in the petroleum  chemicals aerospace  technology and industrial lobs partially offset by an increase in volume in the buildings  infrastructure lob these lower volumes were driven mainly by lower field services volume primarily with petroleum  chemicals customers and the timing of project completions versus new project timing

direct costs of contracts for the year ended september 29 2017 were 825 billion a decrease of 9458 million or 103 from 920 billion for the corresponding period last year direct costs of contracts include all costs incurred in connection with and directly for the benefit of client contracts including depreciation and amortization relating to assets used in providing the services required by the related projects the level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors including the amount of passthrough costs we incur during a period on those projects where we are responsible for subcontract labor or thirdparty materials and equipment we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs and we refer to such costs as “passthrough costs” on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not considered passthrough costs and are therefore not reflected in either revenues or costs to the extent that we incur a significant amount of passthrough costs in a period our direct costs of contracts are likely to increase as well

passthrough costs included in revenues for the year ended september 29 2017 were 254 billion in comparison to 249 billion in line with amounts in the corresponding period last year in general passthrough costs are more significant on projects that have a higher content of field services activities passthrough costs are generally incurred at specific points during the life cycle of a project and are highly dependent on the needs of our individual clients and the nature of the clients’ projects however because we have hundreds of projects which start at various times within a fiscal year the effect of passthrough costs on the level of direct costs of contracts can vary between fiscal years without there being a fundamental or significant change to the underlying business

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts for the year ended september 29 2017 was 823 this compares to 839 for the year ended september 30 2016 the relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided generally the more procurement we do on behalf of our clients eg where we purchase equipment and materials for use on projects andor procure subcontracts in connection with projects and the more field services revenues we have relative to technical professional services revenues the higher the ratio will be of direct costs of contracts to revenues because revenues from passthrough cost arrangements typically have lower margin rates associated with them it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in such revenues without experiencing a proportionate increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit the reduction in cost relative to revenue is driven by both 1 our strategic focus on realigning our portfolio to higher profit businesses and 2 a reduction in field services revenue which tends to have a lower margin as a percent of total revenue resulting in higher margin overall

selling general  administrative expenses for the year ended september 29 2017 were 13800 million a decrease of 492 million or 34 from 14292 million for the corresponding period last year the decrease in sga expenses for the comparative annual periods was due mainly to lower restructuring and other charges of 759 million and related savings from the 2015 restructuring these decreases were offset in part by higher year over year spending mainly in personnel related costs and professional service fees including an additional 17 million associated with ch2m professional service fees and integration costs

net interest expense for the year ended september 29  2017 was  33 million a decrease of 4 1 million from  74 million for the corresponding period last year the decrease in interest expense for the year ended september 29  2017 as compared to the corresponding period last year was due primarily to the reversal of 2 5 million of accrued interest expense related to the statute expiration of a foreign tax reserve as well as higher levels of interest income  

miscellaneous expense net for the year ended september 29 2017 was 66 million as compared to 31 million for the corresponding period last year this change was due primarily to a reversal in fiscal 2016 of 51 million of accrued penalties related to the statute expiration of a foreign tax reserve which did not recur in fiscal 2017 offset in part by other miscellaneous charges 

gainloss on disposal of business and investments was 109 million and 414 million for the years ended september 29 2017 and september 30 2016 respectively the reported amounts for fiscal 2017 were associated mainly with the company’s divestiture of its equity investment in neste jacobs oy a joint venture between the company and neste corporation the 414 million loss on disposal in fiscal 2016 was mainly attributable to the company’s loss on the sale of our french subsidiary of 244 million and a noncash writeoff on an equity investment of 170 million

the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate is generally lower than the us statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the impacts of favorable tax rate differences in our foreign operations the following table reconciles total income tax expense using the statutory us federal income tax rate to the consolidated income tax expense shown in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings for the years ended september 29 2017 and september 30 2016 dollars in thousands 

 



 

the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate for the year ended september 29 2017 increased to 269 from 252 for fiscal 2016 key drivers for this year over year increase include the impacts of lower foreign tax credit benefits and lower benefits from valuation allowance releases on foreign deferred tax assets partly offset by favorable impacts of us tax cost of foreign operations the nonrecurrence of 2016 tax rate change impacts on deferred income tax assets in the uk and favorable impacts from change in uncertain tax positions

fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015

total revenues for the year ended september 30 2016 were 1096 billion a decrease of 115 billion or 95 from 1211 billion for the corresponding period last year the decrease in revenues was due primarily to lower volumes in the

petroleum  chemicals aerospace  technology and buildings  infrastructure lobs partially offs et by an increase in the industrial lob 

direct costs of contracts decreased 10 billion or 94 from 101 billion during fiscal 2015 to 92 billion during fiscal 2016 direct costs of contracts include all costs incurred in connection with and directly for the benefit of client contracts including depreciation and amortization relating to assets used in connection with providing the services required by client projects the level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors including the amount of passthrough costs we incur during a period on those projects where we are responsible for subcontract labor or third party materials and equipment we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs and we refer to such costs as “passthrough costs” on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not considered passthrough costs and are therefore not reflected in either revenues or costs to the extent that we incur a significant amount of passthrough costs in a period our direct cost of contracts are likely to increase as well the decrease in direct costs of contracts between fiscal years 2015 and 2016 is primarily a result of the general decline in our business

passthrough costs decreased 1127 million or 43 from 26 billion during fiscal 2015 to 25 billion for fiscal 2016 in general passthrough costs are more significant on projects that have a higher content of field services activities passthrough costs are generally incurred at a specific point in the lifecycle of a project and are highly dependent on the needs of our individual clients and the nature of the clients’ projects however because we have hundreds of projects which start at various times within a fiscal year the effect of passthrough costs on the level of direct costs of contracts can vary between fiscal years without there being a fundamental or significant change to the underlying business

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts were 839 for fiscal 2016 compared to 838 for fiscal 2015 the relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided generally speaking the more procurement we do on behalf of our clients ie where we purchase equipment and materials for use on projects andor procure subcontracts in connection with projects and the more field services revenues we have relative to technical professional services revenues the higher the ratio will be of direct costs of contracts to revenues because revenues from passthrough costs typically have lower margin rates associated with them it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in such revenues without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit the ratio of direct costs of contracts to revenues was flat over the prior year period the company experienced a slight decrease in margins in fiscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015

 

sga expenses for fiscal 2016 decreased by 936 million or 6 to 143 billion compared to 152 billion for fiscal 2015 the decrease in sga expenses was primarily due to higher sga savings associated with the 2015 restructuring excluding the effects of the 2015 restructuring in both fiscal 2016 and 2015 adjusted sga expenses for fiscal 2016 decreased 1269 million or 9 to 124 billion from 137 billion in fiscal 2015

net interest expense for fiscal 2016 decreased 48 million to 74 million from 122 million in fiscal 2015 included in net interest expense for fiscal 2016 was a reversal of 27 million of accrued interest expense related to the expiration of the statutue of limitations relating to a foreign tax reserve interest expense for fiscal 2016 was also lower when compared to the same period last year due to lower debt levels

loss on disposal of business and investments for fiscal 2016 increased by 385 million to 414 million from 29 million in fiscal 2015 the increase is due to the previously discussed fiscal 2016 loss items on the sale of our french subsidiary of 244 million and a noncash writeoff on an equity investment of 170 million

miscellaneous expense for fiscal 2016 increased 28 million to 31 million from 02 million in fiscal 2015 the increase over the prior year period was primarily due to realized exchange rate losses included in miscellaneous expense for fiscal 2016 was a reversal of 51 million of accrued penalties related to the expiration of the statute of limitations relating to a foreign tax reserve

the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate is generally lower than the u  s  statutory rate of 35 pr imarily due to the impacts of favorable tax rate differences in our foreign operations the following table reconciles total income tax expense using the statutory us federal income tax rate to the consolidated income tax expense shown in the accompanyi ng consolidated statements of earnings for the years ended september 30 2016 and october 2 2015 dollars in thousands 

 



 

the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate for the year ended september 30 2016 increased to 252 from 235 for fiscal 2015 the primary components of this increase in tax rate were due mainly to unfavorable impacts from us tax cost of foreign operations the nonrecurrence of tax deductible foreign currency losses in fiscal 2015 unfavorable impacts from uk tax rates changes on deferred tax assets and other unfavorable items these unfavorable impacts on the tax rate were partly offset by favorable foreign tax credits year over year favorable income levels from our foreign partnerships in 2016 and comparably higher benefits from foreign valuation allowance releases in fiscal 2016

in evaluating the company’s performance by operating segment the codm reviews various metrics and statistical data for each lob but focuses primarily on revenues and operating profit as discussed above segment operating profit includes not only local sga expenses but the sga expenses of the company’s support groups that have been allocated to the segments in addition the company attributes each lob’s specific incentive compensation plan costs to the lobs the revenues of certain lobs are more affected by passthrough revenues than other lobs the methods for recognizing revenue incentive fees project losses and change orders are consistent among the lobs 

aerospace  technology

 



 

aerospace  technology segment revenues for the year ended september 29 2017 were 236 billion down 2968 million or 112 from 266 billion for the corresponding period last year the decrease in revenues was mainly in our us government business sector where rebid losses and small business award preferences drove the declines unfavorable foreign currency impacts of approximately 13 million also contributed to this year over year decline these unfavorable items were partially offset by positive gains from organic growth and improvement in our telecommunications sector our nasa projects and our projects for the ministry of defence in australia

 

aerospace  technology revenues for the fiscal year ended september 30 2016 were 266 billion down 2673 million or 91 from 292 billion in fiscal 2015 the decrease was due mainly to the impact of certain of our us government customers’ shift to a smallbusiness preference in contract awards of approximately 281 million offset slightly by stronger revenues in our uk nuclear and defense markets of approximately 14 million

operating profit for the aerospace  technology segment was 2026 million for the year ended september 29 2017 down 12 million or 06 from 2038 million for the year ended september 30 2016 this decrease in profitability was due primarily to the revenue declines in the us government business sector mentioned above as well as lower equity income from our uk joint venture for the comparative periods mainly associated with year over year declines in project funding

aerospace and technology operating profit for the year ended september 30 2016 was 2038 million down 16 million or 08 from 2054 million in fiscal 2015 the slight decrease in operating profit was due mainly to the us 

page 48

government customer shifts in fiscal 2016 described above but was mostly mitigated by improving our per formance on fixed price contracts  which increased operating profit by 145 million over the comparable prior year period 

buildings  infrastructure

 



 

buildings  infrastructure revenues for the year ended september 29 2017 were 245 billion an increase of 1988 million or 88 versus 225 billion for the comparable period in 2016 the year over year increases in revenues was due mainly to us client spending level increases in the projectmanagementconstructionmanagement “pmcm” market year over year impacts on revenues from unfavorable foreign currency were approximately 36 million

 

buildings  infrastructure revenues for the year ended september 30 2016 was 23 billion a decrease of 2049 million or 83 from 25 billion in fiscal 2015 the decrease was primarily due to reduced us and uk client spending in certain markets during fiscal 2016

operating profit for buildings  infrastructure for the year ended september 29 2017 was 1935 million up 188 million or 108 compared to 1746 million for 2016 excluded from the presented operating profit amounts for the year ending september 29 2017 were 238 million in restructuring and other charges related to strategic business restructuring activities in our uk middle east and europe businesses increases in profitability for the period in 2017 over 2016 were due mainly to higher revenue from the us pmcm projects partially offset by charges from a contract settlement of 60 million

operating profit for the year ended september 30 2016 were 1746 million an increase of 293 million or 202 from 1453 million for 2015 proactive cost control and restructuring efforts contributed to the increase in operating profit for fiscal 2016 as compared to the corresponding period last year as a result operating margin for fiscal 2016 improved to 78 compared to 59 in fiscal 2015

industrial 

 



industrial revenues for the year ended september 29 2017 were 274 billion versus 279 billion for the same period in 2016 down 501 million or 18 the decrease in revenues was due mainly to revenue declines from field services project completions weaker market conditions in the mining  minerals businesses and unfavorable foreign currency impacts partially offset by improvements in higher revenues associated with increased client major capex spending in the life sciences business

industrial revenues for the year ended september 30 2016 were 279 million an increase of 2761 million or 110 from 25 billion in fiscal 2015 the increase was primarily due to new life sciences projects offset by a decline in the mining  minerals business due to weak market conditions

operating profit for the year ended september 29 2017 was 1153 million up 340 million or 418 from 813 million for the corresponding period last year the increase in profitability was due mainly to improved project performance in the mining  minerals business and higher levels of professional service and project procurement business in the life sciences business year over year profit comparisons were also impacted by unfavorable charges in the second quarter fiscal 2016 associated with litigation settlements and a customer bankruptcy amounting to 122 million

operating profit for the year ended september 30 2016 was 813 million a decrease of 453 million or 358 from 1265 million in fiscal 2015 the decrease was due to the decline in the mining  minerals business and was caused primarily by a negotiated settlement of a project claim that occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 combined with the 

page 49

negative effects of a litigation settlement affecting the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and a customer bankruptcy these decreases were offset in part by the increases in the life sciences market and benefits associated with the 2015 restructuring althoug h driven by discrete items in each of the periods presented the change in operating profit was negative as a result operating margin for fiscal 2016 declined to 29 from 50 for the corresponding period last year 

petroleum  chemicals

 



 

petroleum  chemicals revenues for the year ended september 29 2017 were 245 billion a decrease of 7933 million or 243 from 326 billion for the same period in 2016 the decrease in revenues for the year ended september 29 2017 as compared to the prior year was due primarily to the completion or winddown of several projects with significant passthrough revenue as well as award delays of large post frontend engineering and design projects as clients continue to evaluate their capital spending plans as oil prices remained low both of these factors resulted in lower field service revenues compared with the prior year periods while client investment spending continues primarily on compliance maintenance and sustaining capital programs additionally foreign currency impacts were unfavorable of approximately 18 million on year over year revenue comparisons for fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2016

 

petroleum  chemicals revenues for the year ended september 30 2016 were 326 billion a decrease of 9546 million or 227 from 42 billion in fiscal 2015 the decrease was primarily due to lower business volume in the oil  gas market sector and to a lesser extent the refining market sector particularly in the middle east and north america as weak oil prices have significantly impacted client capital spending and delayed the pace of new contract awards

operating profit for the year ended september 29 2017 was 1139 million a decrease of 127 million or 101 from 1266 million for the corresponding period last year the decrease in profitability as compared to the prior year period was due mainly to revenue declines from lower business volumes mentioned above offset in part by sga savings from restructuring efforts and a onetime 99 million benefit associated with benefit plan changes in our india operations

operating profit for the year ended september 30 2016 was 1266 million down 117 million or 85 from 1384 million in fiscal 2015 the decrease in operating profit primarily was due to lower volume in the oil and gas and refining market sectors offset in part by significant savings from restructuring efforts and lob structure efficiencies a continued strong focus on cost reductions has partially mitigated the volume reduction impact on operating profit as a result operating margin for the year ended september 30 2016 increased to 39 from 33 in fiscal 2015

other corporate expenses

other corporate expenses were 816 million 601 million and 158 million for the years ended september 29 2017 september 30 2016 and october 2 2015 the increases across the respective years were due mainly to higher spending in personnel related costs and outside services offset by savings from the 2015 restructuring program

included in other corporate expenses in the above table are costs and expenses which relate to general corporate activities as well as corporatemanaged benefit and insurance programs such costs and expenses include i those elements of sga expenses relating to the business as a whole ii those elements of our incentive compensation plans relating to corporate personnel whose other compensation costs are not allocated to the lobs iii the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of purchased business combinations iv the quarterly variances between the company’s actual costs of certain of its selfinsured integrated risk and employee benefit programs and amounts charged to the lobs and v certain adjustments relating to costs associated with the company’s international defined benefit pension plans in addition other corporate expenses may also include from time to time certain adjustments to contract margins both positive and negative associated with projects where it has been determined in the opinion of management that such adjustments are not indicative of the performance of the related lob

backlog information 

we include in backlog the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us our policy with respect to om contracts however is to include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for one succeeding year regardless of the remaining life of the contract for national government programs other than national government om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding option periods because of the nature size expected duration funding commitments and the scope of services required by our contracts the timing of when backlog will be recognized as revenues can vary greatly between individual contracts

 

consistent with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the option of the client while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog at any given time our backlog is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein backlog is not necessarily an indicator of future revenues

because certain contracts eg contracts relating to large epc projects as well as national government programs can cause large increases to backlog in the fiscal period in which we recognize the award and because many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years we evaluate our backlog on a yearoveryear basis rather than on a sequential quarteroverquarter basis

please refer to item 1a— risk factors  above for a discussion of other factors that may cause backlog to ultimately convert into revenues at different amounts

the following table summarizes our backlog for the years ended september 29 2017 september 30 2016 and october 2 2015 in millions 

 



 

increases in backlog in aerospace  technology for the years presented were primarily the result of new awards from the us federal government

increases in backlog in building  infrastructure for the years presented were primarily the result of new awards in the us market

decreases in backlog in the industrial line of business resulted mainly from a large cancellation in the life sciences area and strong revenue realization associated with large pharma projects for fiscal 2017 versus fiscal 2016 the decrease from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 was primarily related to a lower level of field services awards

the decrease in backlog in petroleum  chemicals from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 was due mainly to continuing weakness in the upstream market partly offset by strong performance in chemicals backlog the decrease from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 was primarily related to weak oil prices affecting our customers’ capital spend

backlog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies totaled approximately 46 billion or 232 of total backlog 48 billion or 254 of total backlog and 46 billion or 239 of total backlog at september 29 2017 september 30 2016 and october 2 2015 respectively most of our federal government contracts require that services be provided beyond one year in general these contracts must be funded annually ie the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the us congress to the procuring agency and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts

we estimate that approximately 7 billion or 35 of total backlog at september 29 2017 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year

liquidity and capital resources 

at september 29 2017 our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 7742 million of cash and cash equivalents 13 billion of available borrowing capacity under our 16 billion 2014 revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” and 15 billion of available borrowings under our term loan facility defined below additional information regarding the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility is set forth in note 6  borrowings in notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k we finance much of our operations and growth through cash generated by our operations

on september 28 2017 the company entered into a 15 billion unsecured delayeddraw term loan facility the “term loan facility” with a syndicate of financial institutions as lenders and letter of credit issuers subject to certain terms and conditions set forth therein loans under the term loan facility may be incurred on the day the ch2m acquisition is consummated in order to pay cash consideration for the transaction and to pay fees and expenses related to the acquisition and the term loan facility 

the company intends to finance the cash consideration for the ch2m acquisition the repayment of ch2m’s outstanding indebtedness and other transaction expenses with a combination of cash on hand and debt financing which includes term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 15 billion and additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility the company currently estimates that the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness to be incurred in connection with the acquisition will be approximately 19 billion 

at september 29 2017 our cash and cash equivalents were 7742 million an increase of 1184 million from 6557 million at september 30 2016 this compares to a net increase of 1949 for the year ended september 30 2016

 

the most significant factors contributing to the net increase in cash and cash equivalents for fiscal 2017 from fiscal 2016 were favorable cash from operations of 5749 million partly offset by cash outflows from investing activities of 2362 million 2426 million in cash used in financing activities and unfavorable effects of exchange rate changes of 223 million on a comparative basis cash and cash equivalents increased 1949 million from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2016 mainly from cash generated from operating activities of 6802 million partly offset by cash used in investing activities of 1396 million cash used in financing activities of 3170 million and unfavorable effects of exchange rate changes of 287 million 

our cash from operations for the year ended september 29 2017 was 5749 million down 1053 million from the corresponding period of 2016 this net decrease was mainly associated with increases in net working capital of 2061 million mainly higher accounts receivable and offset in part by higher accounts payable partly offset by higher net earnings of 729 million favorable cash flows from other deferred liabilities of 348 million and other operating cash items our cash from operations for the year ended september 30 2016 was 6802 million up 1956 million from the corresponding period of 2015 this net increase was mainly associated with decreases in working capital of 3731 million mainly lower accounts receivable and increases in billings in excess of costs offset in part by lower net earnings of 1144 million and other operating cash items

with respect to the company’s working capital accounts the company’s cash flows from operations are greatly affected by the costplus nature of our customer contracts because such a high percentage of our revenues are earned on costplus type contracts and due to the significance of revenues relating to passthrough costs most of the costs we incur are included in invoices we send to clients although we continually monitor our accounts receivable we manage the operating cash flows of the company by managing the working capital accounts in total rather than by the individual elements the primary elements of the company’s working capital accounts are accounts receivable accounts payable and billings in excess of cost accounts payable consist of obligations to third parties relating primarily to costs incurred for projects which are generally billable to clients accounts receivable consist of amounts due from our clients of which a substantial portion are for projectrelated costs billings in excess of cost consist of billings to and payments from our clients for costs yet to be incurred

this relationship between revenues and costs and between receivables and payables is unique to our industry and facilitates review of our liquidity at the total working capital level 

with respect to the company’s trade accounts receivable while our credit risk could be significant based on the fact that we provide services to clients operating in a wide range of industries as well as in a number of countries outside the us we manage these issues closely to reduce exposures as much as possible and historically have not experienced material losses our private sector customers include large wellknown and wellestablished multinational companies and our 

page 52

government customers consist of national state and local agencies located principally in the us the uk and australia although we have not histo rically experienced significant collection issues with our governmental or commercial customers we continue to monitor our credit policies with our customers in the markets we serve  

our cash used in investing activities for the year ended september 29 2017 was 2362 million up 966 million from the corresponding period of 2016 this net increase in cash used was due mainly to higher levels of acquisition spend of 1002 million and higher capex of 504 million partly offset by proceeds from the sale of our neste jacobs joint venture our cash used in investing activities for the year ended september 30 2016 was 1396 million up 435 million from the corresponding period of 2015 this net increase in cash used was due mainly to higher levels of spend on acquisitions and divestitures of 609 million offset in part by lower capex of 207 million 

our cash used in financing activities for the year ended september 29 2017 was 2426 million down 744 million from the corresponding period of 2016 this net decrease increase in cash used was mainly attributable to lower net cash activity of longterm borrowings of 384 million and lower cash spend in common stock repurchases of 554 million offset in part mainly by dividends of 542 million paid in 2017 our cash used in financing activities for the year ended september 30 2016 was 3170 million down 2363 million from the corresponding period of 2015 this net decrease increase in cash used was mainly attributable to lower cash spent on common stock repurchases of 2698 million offset in part mainly by higher net cash used in longterm borrowings activity of 527 million 

the company had 7742 million of cash and cash equivalents at september 29 2017 of this amount approximately 1241 million was held in the us and 6501 million was held outside of the us primarily in the uk the eurozone chile and india and was used primarily for funding operations in those regions other than the tax cost of repatriating funds to the us see note 10— income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k there are no impediments to repatriating these funds to the us 

the company had 2621 million in letters of credit outstanding at september 29 2017 of this amount 25 million was issued under the revolving credit facility and 2596 million was issued under separate committed and uncommitted letterofcredit facilities

we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations support our acquisition strategy service our debt and pay dividends for the next twelve months we believe that the capacity terms and conditions of the revolving credit facility and the term loan facility combined with cash onhand and the other committed and uncommitted facilities we have in place are adequate for our working capital and general business requirements for the next twelve months

new accounting pronouncements

 

revenue recognition

from time to time the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issues accounting standards updates each an “asu” to its accounting standards codification “asc” which constitutes the primary source of us gaap the company regularly monitors asus as they are issued and considers their applicability to its business all asus applicable to the company are adopted by the due date and in the manner prescribed by the fasb

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409— revenue from contracts with customers  the new guidance provided by asu 201409 is intended to remove inconsistencies and perceived weaknesses in the existing revenue requirements provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues improve comparability provide more useful information and simplify the preparation of financial statements asu 201409 was initially effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 in july 2015 the fasb approved a oneyear deferral of the effective date of this standard the revised effective date for the standard is for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods therein the fasb also approved changes allowing for early adoption of the standard as of the original effective date

the company’s adoption activities will be performed over three phases i assessment ii design and iii implementation our assessment phase is substantially complete the following are the potential significant differences identified during the assessment phase

 

performance obligations

under current us gaap the company typically considers engineering and construction services as separate performance obligations under asu 201409 the company has determined in most instances it is likely that engineering and construction services will be required to be combined into a single performance obligation in these instances this will likely change the timing and pattern of revenue recognition

contract modifications

in many instances the company enters into contracts for construction services subsequent to entering in to engineering services contracts under asu 201409 the construction services contract may be deemed to modify the engineering contract or may be required to be combined with the engineering contract this modification or combination of contracts may result in a cumulative catchup adjustment which will have an immediate impact on the company’s results of operations in the period the contract combination or modification occurs in addition it will change the timing and pattern of revenue recognition after the period the contracts have been combined or modified 

the company currently intends to adopt the new standard using the modified retrospective application this standard could have a significant impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and an administrative impact on its operations and will depend on the magnitude of the items discussed above the company will continue to evaluate the impact through the design and implementation phases

 

lease accounting

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602— leases  asu 201602 requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases asu 201602 is effective for public entity financial statements for annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods early adoption is permitted including adoption in an interim period the guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements the company is evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements this standard could have a significant administrative impact on its operations and the company will further assess the impact through its implementation program

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

the company’s management with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined by rule 13a15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of september 29 2017 the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k the “evaluation date” based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the exchange act were functioning effectively as of the evaluation date to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the company in reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining for the company adequate internal controls over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act management with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the evaluation date based on the framework established in “internal control—integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework based on this evaluation management has concluded that the company’s internal controls over financial reporting as of the evaluation date were effective the company’s independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting which appears later in this annual report on form 10k

page 57

changes in internal control 

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the company’s fiscal quarter ended september 29 2017 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting

limitations on effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its system of internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed or operated can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of internal control are met the design of the company’s control system reflects the fact that there are resource constraints and that the benefits of such control systems must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control failures and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the intentional acts of individuals by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that the design of any particular control will always succeed in achieving its objective under all potential future conditions

employees and safety 

our employees are our most important and valuable asset and therefore the prevention of jobrelated injuries is given top priority it is the policy of the company to provide and maintain a safe and healthy working environment and to follow operating practices that safeguard all employees and result in a more efficient operation beyondzero® the name of our program that promotes our culture of caring moves beyond efforts to have an incident and injuryfree safety performance we implement a culture of caring where concern for employees health safety and welfare extends outside the office walls beyond the project site fences and into their homes cars and all the places where they interact with family friends and fellow employees

since jacobs’ founding the company has been based on doing business honestly ethically and with the utmost integrity our culture and our code of conduct which is signed annually by all employees prescribe that everyone at the company must adhere to jacobs’ core values and ethical code and comply with the laws that govern the company’s activities worldwide our employees and business partners are expected to follow the highest principles of business conduct integrity and ethics as they carry out their responsibilities and are guided by the following principles in carrying out their responsibilities loyalty compliance with applicable laws observance of ethical standards avoidance of conflicts of interest and communication we endeavor to deal fairly with our employees customers suppliers and competitors and to respect the policies and procedures of those outside the company

we strive to present a clear and consistent image of our company to our clients employees shareholders and business partners  regarding how we behave how we communicate how we look and most importantly how our promises to our clients are delivered  anywhere in the world 

we accomplish this foremost through our core values which allow us to behave as one company and unify us worldwide by keeping our core values as a central focus of our company we are able to think the same way and arrive at similar conclusions regardless of our physical location our core values are







the balance inherent in our core values is also evident in our approach to sustainability which maintains an even balance among the people the economics and the environmental aspects of business jacobs is driven to continuously 

page 4

improve efficiency and reduce energy and resource use practices that driv e down costs and contribute to a lower impact on the environment the company adheres to the following seven sustainability principles 















applying the best most efficient and effective sustainable solutions for clients worldwide in all major industries in which our clients operate allows us to make a significant contribution to a safe and sustainable future each year we issue a sustainability report that describes many of our efforts and accomplishments regarding environmental sustainability

with respect to human resources our goal is to establish an inclusive diverse workplace that energizes the people who fuel our companys growth although we are a large company with over 54000 employees in over 25 countries our employees are unified in their focus on superior value safety and ethical business practices regardless of the country in which they work and employees frequently move around the system as they grow their careers

how we grow 

jacobs has grown significantly since its founding in 1947 both through organic growth and through strategic acquisitions an important part of the company’s growth strategy we have acquired and integrated numerous companies over the years that have enhanced our capabilities geographic reach and offerings

in terms of organic growth our relationshipbased business model is central to our sustained growth and profitability we pursue the development of longterm relationships and alliances with our clients by working with our clients on their capital programs we increase our understanding of their overall business needs as well as the unique technical requirements of their specific projects this increased understanding enables us we believe to provide superior value to our clients our approach provides us with opportunities to market the services our clients are expected to need in the predesign phase such as master planning permitting or project finance options in the design phase and in the construction poststartup and commissioning phases of a facility including operations and maintenance services

our relationships with clients also present ongoing opportunities to expand into adjacent markets for example clients operating in the mining and minerals market often have a need for our infrastructure and buildings capabilities the same is true for clients operating in other markets

we market our services to clients in a wide range of public institutional process and industrial markets we increase our opportunities through focused market diversity and are able to price contracts competitively and enhance overall profitability while delivering additional value to our clients by integrating and bundling our services in complex economic times we have the ability to evolve along with market cycles worldwide when opportunities decrease in a particular market or geography other opportunities often increase because of our focused market diversity we believe we are well positioned to address a wide range of opportunities across many markets and geographies which helps us grow our business

page 5

the role of acquisitions and strategic investments in the development our business 

when we review acquisition targets we are conscious of the effect the acquisition may have on our client base we favor acquisitions that are aligned with our growth strategy which targets enhancements of our market position and adding value to our customers and shareholders this will be done by i expanding into a new client market ii enhancing the range of services we provide existing clients andor iii accessing new geographic areas in which our clients either already operate or plan to expand by expanding into new geographic areas and adding to our existing technical and project management capabilities we strive to position ourselves as a preferred singlesource provider of technical professional and construction services to our clients the following is a brief description of some of our recent key acquisitions in reverse chronological order





















page 6















after we complete an acquisition we move quickly to integrate the newly acquired operations we typically assign senior operations personnel to manage the overall integration process with assistance from our sales accounting legal it human resources and risk management departments although integrating newly acquired businesses can be very challenging the assimilation process is critical in order to assure i an appropriate return is realized versus the cost of the acquisition ii that our global businesses processes and systems are properly deployed throughout the newlyacquired entities and iii that we can begin to leverage off the acquired talents skills and expertise to grow our business and help our clients execute their capital programs newly acquired businesses are generally not left as standalone entities within the company’s internal reporting system the businesses we acquire are typically folded in to existing operational organizations within the company for additional information regarding certain issues related to our acquisition strategy please refer to item 1a— risk factors below

lines of business 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we reorganized our operations around four global lines of business this reorganization is intended to better serve our global clients leverage our workforce help streamline operations and provide enhanced growth opportunities the four global lines of business are petroleum  chemicals buildings  infrastructure aerospace  technology and industrial each business unit has a president that reports directly to the companys president  ceo as part of the reorganization certain support functions ie sales which were managed centrally for many years have been embedded in the lines of business and report to the respective line of business presidents the costs of other support functions eg accounting legal human resources and information technology and certain other activities eg global insurance are assigned or allocated to each new business unit using a rationale method of assignmentallocation or will remain an element of corporate general and administrative expenses in connection with the reorganization the company

has significantly modified its cash incentive plan utilizing forecasted performanc e metrics aligned along the new lines of business 

 

services 

our services fall into four broad categories project services process scientific and systems consulting services construction services and operations and maintenance services

 

project services 

 

we employ the engineering architecture interiors design planning and related disciplines necessary to design and engineer modern process plants buildings infrastructure projects technology and manufacturing facilities consumer products manufacturing facilities power plants and stations pulp and paper plants and other facilities

 

we are capable of providing our clients with a variety of value engineering services including safety in design through safety in design we integrate best practices hazard analysis and risk assessment methods early in the design phase of projects taking those steps necessary to eliminate or mitigate injury and damage during the construction startup testing and commissioning and operations phases of a project

 

in the area of construction management we provide our clients with a wide range of services as an agent for our clients we may act as program director whereby we oversee on the owners behalf the complete planning design and construction phases of the project alternatively our services may be limited to providing construction consulting

 

project services also includes planning scheduling procurement estimating cost engineering project accounting

project delivery quality safety and all other key support services needed for complete cradletograve project delivery

 

process scientific and systems consulting services 

 

we employ the professional and technical skills and expertise with respect to a broad range of consulting services including performing pricing studies market analyses and financial projections necessary in determining the feasibility of a project performing gasoline reformulation modeling analyzing and evaluating layout and mechanical designs for complex processing plants analyzing automation and control systems analyzing designing and executing bio containment strategies developing and performing process protocols with respect to the us food and drug administrationmandated qualification and validation requirements and performing geological and metallurgical studies

 

also included in this service category are revenues relating to defense and aerospacerelated programs such services typically are more technical and scientific in nature than other project services we provide and may involve such tasks as supporting the development and testing of conventional weapons systems weapons modeling and simulations computer systems development maintenance and support evaluation and testing of missioncritical control systems aerospace testing and propulsion systems and facilities cyber security and it services and other highly technical or scientific tasks

 

construction services 

 

in addition to the construction management services included under project services above we provide traditional field construction services to private and public sector clients we also provide modular construction consulting services in the area of environmental remediation and restoration we also provide environmental remedial construction services for a variety of public and private sector clients

 

historically our field construction activities have been focused primarily on those construction projects for which we perform much of the related engineering and design work by focusing our construction efforts in this way we attempt to minimize the risks associated with constructing complex projects based on designs prepared by third parties the financial risk to us of constructing complex assets based on designs prepared by third parties may be particularly significant on fixedprice contracts though we ensure appropriate controls are in place to manage risk however we will pursue construction

page 8

only projects when we can negotiate pricing and other contract terms we deem acceptable and which we believe can result in a fair return for the degree of risk we assume 

 

operations and maintenance services 

 

operations and maintenance “om” refers to all of the tasks required to operate and maintain large complex facilities on behalf of clients we provide key management and support services over all aspects of the operations of a facility including managing subcontractors and other onsite personnel om also includes process plant maintenance services which generally involves all tasks required to keep a process plant typically a refinery or chemical plant in daytoday operation

 

within the aerospace and defense areas om often requires us to provide the management and technical support services necessary to operate and maintain such sites as engine test facilities weapons integration facilities and hightech simulation and verification centers such om contracts also frequently require us to provide facilities management and maintenance services utilities operations and maintenance services property management and disposition services and construction support services

 

within the environmental area om often includes engineering and technical support services as well as program management services necessary to remediate contaminated sites

 

although the gross profit margins we realize from om services are generally lower than those associated with the other services we provide the costs to support maintenance activities are also generally lower in addition om services offer us an opportunity for longterm relationships with clients this aspect of om services greatly reduces the selling costs in respect of such services

 

 

the following table sets forth our revenues from each of our four service categories for each of the last three fiscal years in thousands

 



segments 

the services we provide fall into the following four lines of business “lob” aerospace technology buildings  infrastructure industrial and petroleum  chemicals which are also the company’s reportable segments

backlog 

backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us with respect to om contracts however we include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for only one succeeding year regardless of the remaining life of the contract for national government programs other than us federal om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding option periods in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation termination or suspension at the discretion of the client in addition the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts accordingly backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings

our backlog includes expected revenues for contracts that are based on estimates the following table summarizes our backlog for each of the last three fiscal years in millions 

 



for additional information regarding our backlog including those risk factors specific to backlog please refer to item 1a — risk factors  and item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below subject to the factors discussed in item 1a— risk factors below we estimate that approximately 77 billion or 4128 of total backlog at september 30 2016 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year

significant customers 

the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government for each of the last five fiscal years 

 



 

given the percentage of total revenue derived directly from the us federal government the loss of us federal government agencies as customers would have a material adverse effect on the company in addition any or all of our government contracts could be terminated we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work or payment of our costs could be disallowed approximately 88 of revenue derived directly from the us federal government is in the aerospace  technology segment for more information on risks relating to our government contracts see item 1a  risk factors below

page 12

financial information about geographic areas 

selected financial information regarding the geographic areas in which we operate is included in note 15 — segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k and is incorporated herein by reference for fiscal 2016 approximately 430 of our revenues were earned from clients outside the united states our international operations are subject to a variety of risks which are described under item 1a  risk factors below

contracts 

while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake our contracts generally fall into two broad categories costreimbursable and fixedprice the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the last five fiscal years

 



 

in accordance with industry practice most of our contracts including those with the us federal government are subject to termination at the discretion of the client which is discussed in greater detail in item 1a — risk factors  in such situations our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination

when we are directly responsible for engineering design procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client’s plant or facility we reflect the costs of materials equipment and subcontracts in both revenues and costs on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs the following table sets forth the approximate amount of such passthrough costs included in revenues for each of the last five fiscal years in millions of dollars

 



 

costreimbursable contracts 

costreimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit the profit element may be in the form of a simple markup applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee or a combination of a markup and a fee the fee element can also take several forms the fee may be a fixed amount it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred or it may be an incentive fee based on targets milestones or performance factors defined in the contract in general we prefer costreimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price

fixedprice contracts 

fixedprice contracts include both “lump sum bid” contracts and “negotiated fixedprice” contracts under lump sum bid contracts we typically bid against other contractors based on specifications the client furnishes this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period additionally it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients which is contrary to our relationshipbased business model accordingly lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract and as such the company has rarely entered into individual lump sum bid contracts that are material to its financial results in contrast under a negotiated fixedprice contract we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client negotiated fixedprice contracts frequently exist in singleresponsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project thus although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us however because of economies that may be realized during the contract term both negotiated fixedprice and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts the company carefully manages the risk inherent in these types of contracts over the past five years most of our fixedprice work has been either negotiated fixedprice contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services rather than turnkey construction

r isk factors 

tableend

we operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future we may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial if any such events actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected

construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces if we fail to maintain safe work sites we can be exposed to significant financial losses and reputational harm as well as civil and criminal liabilities

construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment moving vehicles chemical and manufacturing processes and highly regulated materials in a challenging environment and often in geographically remote locations on many sites we are responsible for safety and accordingly must implement safety procedures if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective our employees and others may become injured disabled or even lose their lives the completion or commencement of our projects may be delayed and we may be exposed to litigation or investigations unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover increase the cost of a project to our clients and raise our operating costs any of the foregoing could result in financial losses or reputational harm which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

in addition our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials which if improperly handled or disposed of could subject us to civil andor criminal liabilities we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health safety and environmental “hse” work procedures throughout our organization including construction sites and maintenance sites the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability in addition despite the work of our functional groups we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel or that there will be no damage to or loss of our work equipment or supplies

our safety record is critical to our reputation many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures accordingly if we fail to maintain adequate safety standards we could suffer reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

our vulnerability to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our clients operate is exacerbated during economic downturns and times of political uncertainty

we provide technical professional construction and om services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration production and refining programs for various national governments including the us federal government chemicals and polymers mining and minerals pharmaceuticals and biotechnology infrastructure buildings power and other general industrial and consumer businesses and markets such as technology and manufacturing pulp and paper and food and consumer products these markets and the resulting demand for our services have been and we expect will continue to be cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control including economic conditions and changes in client spending particularly during periods of economic or political uncertainty

current global economic and political conditions have negatively impacted many of our clients’ ability and willingness to fund their projects including their ability to raise capital and pay or timely pay our invoices they have also caused our clients to reduce their capital expenditures alter the mix of services purchased seek more favorable price and other contract terms and otherwise slow their spending on our services for example in the public sector declines in state and local tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending in addition due to these conditions many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable these conditions have reduced and may continue to reduce the demand for our services which has had and may continue to have a significant negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

current economic and political conditions also make it extremely difficult for our clients our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities for example following the recent us elections many observers 

page 16

expect spending on us infrastructure to increase significantly there is no assurance that such spendin g will occur or that the company will benefit from any increase in spending we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic recovery or downturn worldwide or in our clients’ markets in addition our business has traditionally lagged re coveries in the general economy and therefore may not recover as quickly as the economy at large a continuation or worsening of current weak economic conditions a failure to obtain expected benefits from any increased infrastructure spending or a redu ction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

regardless of economic or market conditions investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients’ markets and investment decisions as a result our past results have varied and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate

fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers’ investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation delays in existing work or changes in the timing and funding of new awards

commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways for example for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil gas copper or fertilizers fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and therefore their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments furthermore declines in commodity prices can negatively impact our business in regions whose economies are substantially dependent on commodity prices such as the middle east to the extent commodity prices decline or fluctuate and our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects the demand for our services decreases which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned as well as those in progress and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

our project execution activities may result in liability for faulty services

if we fail to provide our services in accordance with applicable professional standards we could be exposed to significant monetary damages or even criminal violations our engineering practice for example involves professional judgments regarding the planning design development construction operations and management of industrial facilities and public infrastructure projects while we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages in our contracts and although we have adopted a range of insurance risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities a catastrophic event at one of our project sites or completed projects resulting from the services we have performed could result in significant professional or product liability and warranty or other claims against us as well as reputational harm especially if public safety is impacted these liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or the fees we generate may not be covered by insurance at all due to various exclusions in our coverage and could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future further even where coverage applies the policies have deductibles which result in our assumption of exposure for a layer of coverage with respect to any claim filed by us in addition clients or subcontractors who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us an uninsured claim either in part or in whole as well as any claim covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible if successful and of a material magnitude could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

we engage in a highly competitive business if we are unable to compete effectively we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted

we face intense competition to provide technical professional and construction services to clients the markets we serve are highly competitive and we compete against a large number of regional national and multinational companies 

the extent of our competition varies by industry geographic market and project type for example with respect to our construction and operations and maintenance services clients generally award large projects to large contractors which may give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects conversely with respect to our engineering design architectural and consulting services low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller newer competitors the extent and type of competition varies by market and geographic area

page 17

our projects are frequently awarded through a competitive bidding process which is standard in our industry we are constantly competing for project awards based on pricing schedule and the breadth and technical sophistication of our services competition can place downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins and may force us to accept contractual terms and conditions that are less favorable to us th ereby increasing the risk that among other things we may not realize profit margins at the same rates as weve seen in the past or may become responsible for costs or other liabilities we have not accepted in the past if we are unable to compete effecti vely we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both which if significant could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the performance of these contracts

our revenues are derived from new contract awards delays in the timing of the awards or cancellations of such prospects as a result of economic conditions material and equipment pricing and availability or other factors could impact our longterm projected results it is particularly difficult to predict whether or when we will receive largescale projects as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process which is affected by a number of factors such as market conditions governmental and environmental approvals since a significant portion of our revenues is generated from such projects our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards and the commencement or progress of work under awarded contracts furthermore many of these contracts are subject to financing contingencies and as a result we are subject to the risk that the customer will not be able to secure the necessary financing for the project

in addition many of our contracts require us to satisfy specific progress or performance milestones in order to receive payment from the customer as a result we may incur significant costs for engineering materials components equipment labor or subcontractors prior to receipt of payment from a customer 

the uncertainty of our contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs in some cases we maintain and bear the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than necessary under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards if an expected contract award is delayed or not received we may incur additional costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations

the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

we are a party to litigation in the normal course of business since we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities and projects where design construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or others we are exposed to substantial claims and litigation and investigations if there is a failure at any such facility or project such claims could relate to among other things personal injury loss of life business interruption property damage pollution and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties such as those who use or reside near our clients’ projects we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met in many of our contracts with clients subcontractors and vendors we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages penalties losses and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts in addition while clients and subcontractors may agree to indemnify us against certain liabilities such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us

we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations our insurance programs have varying exclusions for matters such as fraud coverage limits and maximums and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make in addition we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under these programs as a result we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured

although in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future or that such insurance can be economically secured for example catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits coverage that is more limited or increased premium costs or deductibles we monitor the financial health of the insurance companies from which we procure insurance and this is one of the factors we take into account when purchasing insurance our insurance is purchased from a number of the worlds leading providers often in layered insurance or quota share arrangements if any of our third party insurers fail abruptly cancel our 

page 18

coverage or otherwise cann ot satisfy their insurance requirements to us then our overall risk exposure and operational expenses could be increased and our business operations could be interrupted 

in addition the nature of our business sometimes results in clients subcontractors and vendors presenting claims to us for among other things recovery of costs related to certain projects similarly we occasionally present change orders and claims to our clients subcontractors and vendors for among other things additional costs exceeding the original contract price if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients subcontractors and vendors we could incur cost overruns reduced profits or in some cases a loss for a project further these claims can be the subject of lengthy negotiations arbitration or litigation proceedings which could result in the investment of significant amounts of working capital pending the resolution of the relevant change orders and claims a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results additionally irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant

litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability product liability criminal liability warranty obligations default under our credit agreements and other liabilities which to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

the nature of our contracts particularly those that are fixedprice subject us to risks of cost overruns we may experience reduced profits or in some cases losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates

for fiscal 2016 approximately 18 of our revenues were earned under fixedprice contracts such contracts require us to estimate the total cost of the project in advance of our performance in addition we may enter into guaranteed maximum price contracts where we guarantee a price or delivery date for fixedprice contracts we may benefit from any costsavings but we bear the risk of paying some if not all of any cost overruns fixedprice contract amounts are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions including those about future economic conditions prices and availability of labor equipment and materials and other exigencies if these estimates prove inaccurate there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications or if circumstances change due to among other things unanticipated technical problems difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals changes in local laws or labor conditions weather or other delays beyond our control changes in the costs of equipment or raw materials our vendors’ or subcontractors’ inability or failure to perform or changes in general economic conditions then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or in some cases a loss for that project these risks are exacerbated for projects with longterm durations because there is an increased risk that the circumstances on which we based our original estimates will change in a manner that increases costs if the project is significant or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

our contracts that are fundamentally cost reimbursable in nature may also present a risk to the extent the final cost on a project exceeds the amount the customer expected or budgeted like fixedprice contracts the expected cost of costreimbursable projects are based in part on our estimates of the resources and time necessary to perform such contracts if we are unable to properly support the costs we incur or otherwise fail to obtain proper reimbursement for all costs incurred  for whatever reason  the project may be less profitable than we expect or even result in losses additionally we may be required to pay liquidated damages if we fail to meet schedule or performance requirements of our contracts which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operation

our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel

the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel including engineers architects designers craft personnel and corporate management professionals at a reasonable cost who have the required experience and expertise the market for these and other personnel is competitive from time to time it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients or to replace such personnel when needed in a timely manner in certain geographic areas for example we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel furthermore some of our personnel hold government granted clearance that may be required to obtain government projects if we were to lose some or all of these personnel they would be difficult to replace loss of the services of or failure to recruit qualified technical and management personnel could limit our ability to successfully complete existing projects and compete for new projects

page 19

in addition in the event that any of our key personnel retire or otherwise leave the company we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans which requires devoting time and resour ces toward identifying and integrating new personnel into leadership roles and other key positions if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans it could have a material adverse impact on our bu siness financial condition and results of operations 

the cost of providing our services including the extent to which we utilize our workforce affects our profitability for example the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts if an expected contract award is delayed or not received we could incur costs resulting from excess staff reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business financial conditions and results of operations

the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted cancelled or suspended by our clients and therefore our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings additionally even if fully performed our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins

backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us as of the end of fiscal 2016 our backlog totaled approximately 188 billion there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or if realized will result in profits in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation termination or suspension at the discretion of the client in the event of a project cancellation we would generally have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns or in response to changes in commodity prices

the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts the revenue for certain contracts included in backlog is based on estimates additionally the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence future profitability

in some markets there is a continuing trend towards costreimbursable contracts with incentivefee arrangements typically our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs overall safety performance overall client satisfaction and other performance criteria if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards we may receive a lower or even zero incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins accordingly there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog assuming they produce the revenues currently expected will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies which are a significant source of our revenue and profit are subject to various uncertainties restrictions and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities as well as profit and cost controls which could result in withholding or delay of payments to us government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding such as sequestration and budget deficits contracts with the us federal government for example are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for government programs may even be eliminated legislatures typically appropriate funds on a yearbyyear basis while contract performance may take more than one year as a result contracts with government agencies may be only partially funded or may be terminated and we may not realize all of the potential revenue and profit from those contracts

our government clients may reduce the scope or terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues for example those with the us federal government represented approximately 214 of our total revenue in fiscal 2016  a significant reduction in government funding or the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

most government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process the us federal government has increasingly relied upon multipleyear contracts with multiple contractors that generally require those contractors to engage 

page 20

in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under a contract this process may result in us facing significant additional pricing pressure and uncertainty and incurring additional costs moreover we ma y not be awarded government contracts because of existing policies designed to protect small businesses and underrepresented minorities our inability to win new contracts or be awarded work under existing contracts could have a negative impact on our bus iness and results of operations 

in addition government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socioeconomic requirements which affect how we transact business with our clients and in some instances impose additional costs on our business operations for example for contracts with the us federal government we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation the truth in negotiations act the cost accounting standards the service contract act and numerous regulations governing environmental protection and employment practices government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than nongovernment contracts this includes for example unlimited indemnification obligations

we also are subject to government audits investigations and proceedings for example government agencies such as the us defense contract audit agency routinely review and audit us to determine the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies and whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations these audits can result in a determination that a rule or regulation has been violated or that adjustments are necessary to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies

if we violate a rule or regulation fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit a variety of penalties can be imposed on us including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties for example in socalled “qui tam” actions brought by individuals or the government under the us federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws treble damages can be awarded in addition any or all of our government contracts could be terminated we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work or payment of our costs could be disallowed the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted

many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances which can be difficult and time consuming to obtain if our employees are unable to obtain or retain the necessary securities clearances our clients could terminate or not renew existing contracts or award us new contracts to the extent this occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted

our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control

as is common in our industry we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures partnerships and similar arrangements this situation exposes us to a number of risks including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients

we cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners including the nonperformance default or bankruptcy of our joint venture partners our partners may be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships if these circumstances occur we may be required to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages provide additional services or make additional investments to ensure adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services under agreements with joint and several liabilities we could be liable for both our obligations and those of our partners these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

we depend on the management effectiveness of our joint venture partners differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major issues which could materially affect the business and operations of these ventures in addition in many of the countries in which we engage in joint ventures it may be difficult to enforce our contractual rights under the applicable joint venture agreement if we are not able to enforce our contractual rights we may not be able to realize the benefits of the joint venture or we may be subject to additional liabilities

we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner in these cases we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

page 21

the failure by a joint venture partner to comply with applicable laws regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and for government clients could result in fines penalties suspension or even debarment being imposed on us which could have a material adverse impact on our bus iness financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts

thirdparty subcontractors we hire perform much of the work performed under our contracts we also rely on thirdparty equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired if we are not able to locate qualified thirdparty subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated especially in a lump sum or a fixedprice contract we may suffer losses on these contracts if a subcontractor supplier or manufacturer fails to provide services supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason we may be required to source these services equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms which could impact contract profitability there is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors relating to among other things the quality and timeliness of work performed customer concerns about the subcontractor or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a contract in addition faulty workmanship equipment or materials could impact the overall project resulting in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications

in the current economic environment third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party’s ability to provide materials equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a failure by a third party subcontractor supplier or manufacturer to comply with applicable laws regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and for government clients could result in fines penalties suspension or even debarment being imposed on us which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

negative conditions in the credit and financial markets and delays in receiving client payments could result in liquidity problems adversely affecting our cost of borrowing and our business

although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions instability in the credit markets in the us or abroad could cause the availability of credit to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain at competitive rates on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts this situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds refinance our existing indebtedness enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us we may also enter into business acquisition agreements that require us to access credit which if not available at the closing of the acquisition could result in a breach of the acquisition agreement and a resulting claim for damages by the sellers of such business in addition market conditions could negatively impact our clients’ ability to fund their projects and therefore utilize our services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

in addition we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors suppliers and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements on less favorable terms with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations

some of our customers suppliers and subcontractors depend on access to commercial financing and capital markets to fund their operations disruptions of the credit or capital markets could adversely affect our clients’ ability to finance projects and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions project delays and payment delays or defaults by our clients in addition clients may be unable to fund new projects may choose to make fewer capital expenditures or otherwise slow their spending on our services or to seek contract terms more favorable to them our government clients may face budget deficits that prohibit them from funding proposed and existing projects or that cause them to exercise their right to terminate our contracts with little or no prior notice in addition any financial difficulties suffered by our subcontractors or suppliers could 

page 22

increase our cost or adversely impact project schedules these disruptions could materially impact our back log and have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are therefore subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices in weak economic environments we may experience increased delays and failures due to among other reasons our clients’ unwillingness to pay for alleged poor performance or to preserve their own working capital if one or more clients delays in paying or fails to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations

furthermore our cash balances and shortterm investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america europe south america australia and asia some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership or have been seized by their governments there is a risk that such events may occur in the future if any such events were to occur we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

maintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts

in line with industry practice we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds or letters of credit to our customers these instruments indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract if a bond or a letter of credit is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond or letter of credit we cannot pursue that project historically we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity but as is typically the case the issuance of a bond is at the surety’s sole discretion and the issuance of a letter of credit is based on the companys creditworthiness because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms in addition future projects may require us to obtain letters of credit that extend beyond the term of our existing credit facilities our inability to obtain adequate bonding and as a result to bid on new contracts that require such bonding or letter of credit could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

past and future environmental heath and safety laws could impose significant additional costs and liabilities

we are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities

various us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants the liability under these laws is joint and several we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen cleanup obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations

when we perform our services our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions we may be subject to liability claims by employees customers and third parties as a result of such exposures in addition we may be subject to fines penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws a claim if not covered or only partially covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition

health safety and environmental laws and regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes thereto could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could for example relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and in turn could 

page 23

negatively impact our revenue changes in the environmental laws and regulations remediation obligations enforcement actions stricter interpretations of existing requiremen ts future discovery of contamination or claims for damages to persons property natural resources or the environment could result in material costs and liabilities that we currently do not anticipate if we fail to comply with any environmental health or safety laws or regulations whether actual or alleged we could be exposed to fines penalties or potential litigation liabilities including costs settlements and judgments any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and res ults of operations 

in addition we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments which may require us or our clients to obtain and to comply with federal state and local government permits and approvals any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial revocation or modification under various circumstances failure to obtain or comply with or the loss or modification of the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and result of operations

if we fail to comply with federal state local or foreign governmental requirements our business may be adversely affected

we are subject to us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business for example our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders although we have policies and procedures to comply with us and foreign international trade laws the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges or debarment from participation in us government contracts and could damage our reputation and our ability to do business

employee agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts which could result in reduced revenues and profits

misconduct fraud noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or other improper activities by one of our employees agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations regulations regarding the protection of classified information regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts regulations on lobbying or similar activities regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting regulations pertaining to export control environmental laws and any other applicable laws or regulations for example we routinely provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters if a security breach were to occur our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective and we could face unknown risks or losses our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties cancellation of contracts loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws

the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act of 2010 and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices despite our training and compliance programs there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions including contract cancellations or debarment and loss of reputation any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

the loss of or a significant reduction in business from one or a few customers could have a material adverse impact on us

a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue andor backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years for example in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 approximately 

page 24

214 217 and 178 res pectively of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government although we have longstanding relationships with many of our significant clients our clients may unilaterally reduce delay or cancel their contrac ts at any time our loss of or a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our international operations are exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies

for fiscal 2016 approximately 430 of our revenue was earned from clients outside the us our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues our international operations are subject to a variety of risks including





































the lack of a welldeveloped legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights in addition military action or continued unrest particularly in the middle east could impact the supply or pricing of oil disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic political and other conditions our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected

we work in international locations where there are high security risks which could result in harm to our employees or unanticipated cost

some of our services are performed in highrisk locations where the country or location is subject to political social or economic risks or war or civil unrest in those locations where we have employees or operations we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel despite these activities in these locations we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel and we may suffer future losses of employees and subcontractors acts of terrorism and threats of armed conflicts in or around various areas in which we operate could limit or disrupt markets and our 

page 25

operations including disruptions resul ting from the evacuation of personnel cancellation of contracts or the loss of key employees contractors or assets 

foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects

our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects both positive and negative that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar into the us dollar while we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in the currencies of our expenditures we do enter into contracts that expose us to currency risk particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs we attempt to minimize our exposure from currency risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies or entering into derivative hedging instruments when there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts these actions however may not always eliminate currency risk exposure the governments of certain countries have or may in the future impose restrictive exchange controls on local currencies and it may not be possible for us to engage in effective hedging transactions to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in a particular currency based on fluctuations in currency the us dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly we may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries

our operations may be impacted by the united kingdom’s proposed exit from the european union

in june 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” as a result of the referendum there may be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the uk and eu countries and increased regulatory complexities these changes may adversely affect our relationships with our existing and future customers suppliers employees and subcontractors or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations brexit may also create global economic uncertainty which may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs terminate or reduce the scope of existing contracts decrease or postpone currently planned contracts or negotiate for more favorable deal terms each of which may have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties

our business strategy involves growth through among other things the acquisition of other companies acquiring companies presents a number of risks including























page 26





while we may obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses such rights may be difficult to enforce the losses may exceed any dedicated escrow funds and the indemnitors may not have the ability to financially support the indemnity

if our management is unable to successfully integrate acquired companies or implement our growth strategy our operating results could be harmed in addition even if the operations of an acquisition are integrated successfully we may not realize the full benefits of an acquisition including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all moreover we cannot assure that we will continue to successfully expand or that growth or expansion will result in profitability

in addition there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us existing cash balances and cash flow from operations together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities may be insufficient to make acquisitions future acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing which may not be available on attractive terms or at all acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced

in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make we could dilute share ownership

one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities if we issue additional equity securities such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders’ individual ownership percentages in the company

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock fluctuations are caused by a number of factors including





























page 27

our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements 

in preparing our financial statements our management is required under us gaap to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities areas requiring significant estimates by our management include





















our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations

we may be adversely impacted by or unable to fully realize the benefits of our corporate reorganization

in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we reorganized the company’s operating units into four lines of business each of which is a separate reportable segment we may be unable to realize the anticipated longer term efficiency benefits of the reorganization furthermore our reorganization into four reportable segments which also represent the company’s reporting units may have a material impact on the risk that an impairment charge of goodwill will occur in the past with a single reportable segment the company had two reporting units following the reorganization our number of reporting units has increased to four reporting units our goodwill was allocated amongst the new reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing on the basis of enterprise fair values this allocation of goodwill to the four new reporting units could make it more likely that the company will have an impairment charge in the future in circumstances where an impairment charge may not have been necessary prior to the reorganization an impairment charge to one of our reporting units could have an impact on our results of operations

an impairment charge of goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations

because we have grown in part through acquisitions goodwill and intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets under us gaap we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach as of september 30 2016 we had 31 billion of goodwill representing 418 of our total assets of 74 billion we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business potential government actions toward our facilities and other factors

if our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value we could be required to record an impairment charge the 

page 28

amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our fi nancial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing please see item 7— management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below  

we may be required to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and postretirement benefit plans we manage

we have various employee benefit plan obligations that require us to make contributions to satisfy over time our underfunded benefit obligations which are generally determined by calculating the projected benefit obligations minus the fair value of plan assets for example as of september 30 2016 and october 2 2015 our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by 4031 million and 4131 million respectively see note 6— pension plans of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k for additional disclosure in the future our benefit plan obligations may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of interest rates pension plan asset performance and other factors if we are required to contribute a significant amount of the deficit for underfunded benefit plans our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected

rising inflation interest rates andor construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts in particular with respect to our fixedprice contracts

rising inflation interest rates or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services in addition we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixedprice because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from costreimbursable type contracts approximately 82 during fiscal 2016 the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor however if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixedprice and lumpsum work is more prevalent inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future therefore increases in inflation interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

we may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change

growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations for example there is a growing consensus that new and additional regulations may be enacted concerning among other things greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased compliance costs for us and our clients legislation international protocols regulation or other restrictions on emissions could also affect our clients including those who are involved in the exploration production or refining of fossil fuels emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels or emit greenhouse gases through the mining manufacture utilization or production of materials or goods such policy changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or in some cases prevent a project from going forward thereby potentially reducing the need for our services which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations however these changes could also increase the pace of projects such as carbon capture or storage projects that could have a positive impact on our business we cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers

our effective tax rate may increase or decrease

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation the introduction of new tax accounting standards legislation regulations and related interpretations our global mix of earnings the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations

systems and information technology interruption or failure and data security breaches could adversely impact our ability to operate or expose us to significant financial losses and reputational harm

we rely heavily on computer information and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business from time to time we experience occasional system interruptions and delays in the event we are unable to regularly deploy software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other 

page 29

steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems the operation of such systems could be interrupted or result in the loss corruption or release of data in addition our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters force majeure events telecommuni cations failures power loss acts of war or terrorism computer viruses malicious code physical or electronic security breaches intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error or similar events or disruptions any of these or other events could cause interruptions delays loss of critical andor sensitive data or similar effects which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition protection of intellectual property and results of operations as well as those of our clien ts 

in addition we face the threat to our computer systems of unauthorized access computer hackers computer viruses malicious code organized cyberattacks and other security problems and system disruptions including possible unauthorized access to and disclosure of our and our clients’ proprietary or classified information we rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain all confidential and proprietary information on our computer systems but they may still be vulnerable to these threats as a result we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these system disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these disruptions and breaches any of these events could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

we continuously evaluate the need to upgrade andor replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our computing environment to stay current on vendor supported products and to improve the efficiency of our systems and for other business reasons the implementation of new systems and information technology could adversely impact our operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems and our systems implementations may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated systems implementation disruption and any other information technology disruption if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have an adverse effect on our business

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or that of our clients

our technology and intellectual property provide us in certain instances with a competitive advantage although we protect our property through patent registrations license restrictions and similar mechanisms we may not be able to successfully preserve our rights and they could be invalidated circumvented challenged or become obsolete our employees and contractors are subject to confidentiality obligations but this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information andor infringement of our intellectual property in addition the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the us if we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights even if ultimately successful could be costly and could divert management’s attention away from other aspects of our business

in addition if our intellectual property rights or work processes become obsolete we may not be able to differentiate our service offerings and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers our competitors may independently attempt to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies

our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property there is a risk we may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and as a result could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities loss of contracts or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control

extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control such as natural or manmade disasters could negatively impact our ability to operate as an example from time to time we face unexpected severe weather conditions which may result in weatherrelated delays that are not always reimbursable under a fixedprice contract evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services increased labor and material costs in areas resulting from weatherrelated damage and subsequent increased demand for labor and materials for repairing and rebuilding inability to deliver materials equipment and personnel to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules and loss of productivity we may remain obligated to perform our services after any such natural or manmade event unless a force majeure clause or other contractual provision provides us with relief from our contractual obligations if we are not able to react quickly to such events or if a high concentration of our projects 

page 30

are in a specific geographic region that suffers from a natural or manmade catastrophe our operations may be significantly affected which could have a negative impact on our operations in addition if we cannot complete our contracts on time we may be subject to potential liability claims by our cli ents which may reduce our profits 

we are subject to professional standards duties and statutory obligations on professional reports and opinions we issue which could subject us to monetary damages

we issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional engineering expertise as well as our other professional credentials that subject us to professional standards duties and obligations regulating the performance of our services for example we issue opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings if a client or another third party alleges that our report or opinion is incorrect or it is improperly relied upon and we are held responsible we could be subject to significant monetary damages in addition our reports and other work product may need to comply with professional standards licensing requirements securities regulations and other laws and rules governing the performance of professional services in the jurisdiction where the services are performed we could be liable to third parties who use or rely upon our reports and other work product even if we are not contractually bound to those third parties these events could in turn result in monetary damages and penalties

delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control

we are a delaware corporation certain antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us in addition certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover for example







these types of provisions as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders accordingly shareholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares

critical accounting policies and estimates

in order to understand better the changes that occur to key elements of our financial condition results of operations and cash flows a reader of this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements

the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business performing longterm engineering and constructiontype contracts requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect both the entity’s results of operations and the carrying values of its assets and liabilities although our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 – significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k the following discussion is intended to highlight and describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

revenue accounting for contracts and use of joint ventures —in general we recognize revenues at the time we provide services depending on the commercial terms of the contract we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred or using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion this method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress as of the balance sheet dates in making such estimates judgments are required to evaluate the possible effects of variances in schedule the costs of materials and labor productivity and the impact of change orders claims contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee for contracts containing incentive fee arrangements fees are frequently based on achievement of target completion dates target costs andor other performance criteria failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or nonrecoverable costs which could exceed revenues recognized from the project 

we provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known without regard to the percentage of completion for multiple contracts with a single customer we account for each contract separately

the nature of our business sometimes results in clients subcontractors or vendors presenting claims to us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible in those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract we include in the total estimated costs of the contract and therefore the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract an estimate based on all relevant facts and circumstances available of the additional costs to be incurred similarly and in the normal course of business we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible in those situations where we have presented such claims to our clients we include in revenues the amount of costs incurred without profit to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims

certain costreimbursable contracts with government customers as well as many commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment in this situation revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts in those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs that are not allowable under the terms of the contract we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly

as is common to the industry we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures and consortiums although the joint ventures own and hold the contracts with the clients the services required by the contracts are typically performed by us and our joint venture partners or by other subcontractors under subcontracting agreements with the joint ventures the assets of our joint ventures therefore consist almost entirely of cash and receivables representing amounts due from clients and the liabilities of our joint ventures consist almost entirely of amounts due to the joint venture partners for services provided by the partners to the joint ventures under their individual subcontracts and other subcontractors in general at any given time the equity of our joint ventures represents the undistributed profits earned on contracts the joint ventures hold with clients very few of our joint ventures have employees none of our joint ventures have thirdparty debt or credit facilities our joint ventures therefore are simply mechanisms used to deliver engineering and construction services to clients generally they do not in and of themselves present any risk of loss to us or to our partners 

page 36

separate from those that we would carry if we were performing the contract on our own we may however be exposed to additional risk through the use of joint ventures see item 1a – risk fa ctors above under us gaap our share of losses associated with the contracts held by the joint ventures if and when they occur has always been reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

in evaluating the companys joint ventures also referred to as variable interest entities or vies for accounting and consolidation purposes we perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether or not the company has a “controlling financial interest” in the vie the company is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a vie if it has i the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and ii the right to receive benefits or obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie in making our qualitative analysis the company assesses each vie to determine those activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and whether the company another entity or multiple entities have the power to direct those activities

if we determine that we have the power to direct those activities of the vie that most significantly impact its financial performance and have the right or obligation to receive benefits or absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie then we are the primary beneficiary of the vie and we consolidate the vie if we determine that we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the vie or power is shared by two or more unrelated parties then we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not consolidate the vie

for the companys unconsolidated joint ventures we use either the equity method of accounting or proportional consolidation the company does not currently participate in any significant vies in which it has a controlling financial interest there were no changes in facts and circumstances in the period that caused the company to reassess the method of accounting for its vies

accounting for stock issued to employees and others — we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the estimated grantdate fair value of the award we estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors using the blackscholes optionpricing model like all optionpricing models the blackscholes model requires the use of subjective assumptions including i the expected volatility of the market price of the underlying stock and ii the expected term of the award among others accordingly changes in assumptions and any subsequent adjustments to those assumptions can cause different fair values to be assigned to our stock option awards for restricted stock units containing service and performance conditions with measures external to the company compensation expense is based on the fair value of such units determined using monte carlo simulations 

accounting for pension plans — the accounting for pension plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans’ assets and liabilities these assumptions include discount rates investment returns and projected salary increases among others the actuarial assumptions used in determining the funded statuses of the plans are provided in note 7 – pension plans of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

the expected rates of return on plan assets for fiscal 2017 range from 35 to 85 compared to 35 to 85 for the prior year we believe the range of rates selected for fiscal 2017 reflects the longterm returns expected on the plans’ assets considering recent market conditions projected rates of inflation the diversification of the plans’ assets and the expected real rates of market returns the discount rates used to compute plan liabilities were changed from a range of 16 to 78 in fiscal 2015 to a range of 07 to 70 in fiscal 2016 these assumptions represent the company’s best estimate of the rates at which its pension obligations could be effectively settled

changes in the actuarial assumptions often have a material effect on the values assigned to plan assets and liabilities and the associated pension expense for example if the discount rate used to value the net pension benefit obligation “pbo” at september 30 2016 was higher lower by 05 the pbo would have been lower higher at that date by approximately 1244 million for nonus plans and by approximately 91 million for us plans if the expected return on plan assets was higher lower by 10 the net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2017 would be lower higher by approximately 100 million for nonus plans and by approximately 13 million for us plans differences between actuarial assumptions and actual performance ie actuarial gains and losses that are not recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost in the period in which such differences arise are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are recognized as part of net periodic pension cost in future periods in accordance with us gaap management monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in an effort to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used

contractual guarantees litigation investigations and insurance — in the normal course of business we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation the guarantees to which we are a party generally relate to project schedul es and plant performance most of the litigation in which we are involved has us as a defendant in workers’ compensation personal injury environmental employmentlabor professional liability and other similar lawsuits we maintain insurance coverage f or various aspects of our business and operations we have elected however to retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under our insurance programs this situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured and we intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of our contracts 

in accordance with us gaap we record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such guarantees litigation and insurance claims we include any adjustments to such liabilities in our consolidated results of operations

in addition as a contractor providing services to the us federal government and several of its agencies we are subject to many levels of audits investigations and claims by or on behalf of the us federal government with respect to contract performance pricing costs cost allocations and procurement practices we adjust revenues based upon the amounts we expect to realize considering the effects of any client audits or governmental investigations

testing goodwill for possible impairment — the goodwill carried on our consolidated balance sheets is tested annually for possible impairment in performing the annual impairment test we evaluate our goodwill at the reporting unit level the company performs the annual goodwill impairment test for the reporting units at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year the company will test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we reorganized our operations around four global lines of business the four global lines which represent our reporting units are petroleum  chemicals buildings  infrastructure aerospace  technology and industrial previously the company had two reporting units “europe” and “noneurope”

in conjunction with the aforementioned reorganization we performed a quantitative impairment test and we allocated goodwill among our new reporting units based on the relative fair value of the four reporting units as a result in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for each of the company’s reporting units both immediately before and after the reorganization based on this quantitative assessment the fair value of each of the reporting units pre and post reorganization exceeded their respective net book values and accordingly no impairment charge was necessary as a result of the reorganization

us gaap does not prescribe a specific valuation method for estimating the fair value of reporting units the valuation technique used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including revenue growth rates operating margins discount rates and future market conditions among others

we used both an income approach and a market approach to test our goodwill for possible impairment such approaches require us to make estimates and judgments under the income approach fair value is determined by using the discounted cash flows of our reporting units the company ’ s discount rate reflects a weighted average cost of capital  “ wacc ”  for a peer group of companies representative of the company’s respective reporting units under the market approach the fair value of our reporting units is determined by reference to guideline companies that are reasonably comparable to our reporting units the fair values are estimated based on the valuation multiples of the invested capital associated with the guideline companies in assessing whether there is an indication that the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired we utilize the results of both valuation techniques and consider the range of fair values indicated the fair values for each reporting unit exceeded the respective book values ranging from 28 to 90

it is possible that changes in market conditions economy facts and circumstances judgments and assumptions used in estimating the fair value could change resulting in possible impairment of goodwill in the future the fair values resulting from the valuation techniques used are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of the reporting units to willing third parties

in performing the company’s annual impairment test as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2016 t he company performed a qualitative assessment and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts as a result the company is not required to proceed to a quantitative impairment assessment 

page 38

we have determined that the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values for the balance sheets presented 

fiscal 2016

during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we reorganized our operating and reporting structure around four lines of business “lob” this reorganization is intended to better serve our global clients leverage our workforce help streamline operations and provide enhanced growth opportunities the four global lobs are petroleum  chemicals buildings  infrastructure aerospace  technology and industrial previously the company operated its business as a single segment

  the 2015 restructuring and other events affecting fiscal 2016 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2015 the company commenced a series of initiatives intended to improve operational efficiency reduce costs and better position itself to drive growth of the business in the future the  2015 restructuring the 2015 restructuring was not completed in fiscal 2015 and actions related to the 2015 restructuring continued throughout fiscal 2016 actions related to the 2015 restructuring completed during the fiscal year include involuntary terminations the abandonment of certain leased offices combining operational organizations and the colocation of employees into other existing offices the companys consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2016 include a 1879 million pretax impact relating to costs associated with the 2015 restructuring the majority of the costs of the 2015 restructuring are included in selling general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings 

the company previously announced on july 15 2016 that it had sold its jacobs france subsidiary the sale is part of the company’s strategy to streamline our overall operational efficiency in regions that fit within our target markets and geographies the loss on the sale of our french subsidiary was 171 million or 014 per diluted share

in addition to the 2015 restructuring and the sale of our french subsidiary the company’s consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2016 also include a noncash writeoff on an equity investment of 104 million or 009 per share the write off of the equity investment and the loss on sale of our french subsidiary are included in loss on disposal of business and investments on the consolidated statements of earnings

the following table summarizes the effects of the 2015 restructuring and other events on the companys consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 in thousands except for earnings per share

the 2015 intercompany debt refinancing

during the third quarter of fiscal 2015 the company completed the refinancing of certain international intercompany debt the 2015 intercompany debt refinancing the 2015 intercompany debt refinancing resulted in a onetime tax benefit of 231 million or 018 per share

2016 overview

the companys gaap net earnings for fiscal 2016 decreased by 925 million or 305 when compared to fiscal 2015 the company’s results for fiscal 2016 when compared to the prior year were negatively impacted by the 2015 restructuring the loss on sale of our french subsidiary of 171 million and the noncash writeoff on an equity investment of 104 million mentioned above excluding the effects of the 2015 restructuring and these other events the companys adjusted net earnings for fiscal 2016 decreased by 373 million or 91 compared to the prior year

also influencing the comparability of the company’s fiscal 2016 consolidated results to fiscal 2015 were i a 009 per diluted share tax benefit related to an international tax matter recorded in first quarter of fiscal 2016 ii a 003 net benefit per diluted share benefit related to several items including the release of a foreign tax reserve and a onetime benefit in noncontrolling interests relating to certain work performed by one of our partially owned subsidiaries partially offset by the impact of a customer bankruptcy and a litigation settlement in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 iii a onetime tax related and other items of 41 million or 003 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and iv a onetime tax benefit of 231 million or 018 per share related to the 2015 intercompany debt refinancing recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2015

 

backlog at september 30 2016 was 188 billion and is essentially flat year over year backlog remains near record levels despite the negative effects on backlog stemming from the effects of foreign exchange rate changes new prospects and new sales remain strong and the company continues to have a positive outlook for many of the industry groups and markets in which our clients operate

during fiscal 2016 the company repurchased and retired 34 million shares of its common stock under its share repurchase program total cash spent for the shares repurchased during fiscal 2016 was 1525 million as of october 2 2015 the company exhausted the 500 million approved by the board of directors on august 19 2014 on july 23 2015 the board of directors approved another program to purchase an additional 500 million of the companys common stock over the next three years at the end of fiscal 2016 3475 million remained available under the current plan

business combinations completed between fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2016

during fiscal year 2016 the company acquired jl patterson  associates and the van dyke technology group inc these acquisitions were not material to the company’s consolidated results for fiscal 2016

we also completed a number of other acquisitions during fiscal 2014 including federal network systems llc fns formerly a subsidiary of verizon eagleton engineering llc fmhc corporation stobbarts nuclear limited trompeter enterprises and marmac field services inc the results of operations of these other acquisitions were not material individually or in the aggregate to the companys consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2014 during fiscal 2014 we also acquired an additional 15 interest in jacobs zamel and turbag consulting engineers company zate this transaction brought the companys ownership in zate to 75

page 40

consistent with other business combinations we have completed in the past we began integrating businesses we acquired last year into our existing operations almost immediately after each business was acquired accordingly it is not practicable to provide complete financial in formation for fiscal 2016 on a standalone basis for any of the businesses we acquired last year 

results of operations

during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we reorganized our operating and reporting structure around four lines of business “lob” this reorganization is intended to better serve our global clients leverage our workforce help streamline operations and provide enhanced growth opportunities the four global lobs are petroleum  chemicals buildings  infrastructure aerospace  technology and industrial which are the company’s reportable segments previously the company operated its business as a single segment

 

  reconciliation of segment operating profit to total operating profit

the following table reconciles segment operating profit to total operating profit by including certain corporatelevel items in thousands

 



 

included in “unallocated corporate items” in the above table are costs and expenses which relate to general corporate activities as well as corporatemanaged benefit and insurance programs such costs and expenses include i those elements of sga expenses relating to the business as a whole ii those elements of the company’s cash and equity incentive plans relating to corporate personnel whose other compensation costs are not allocated to the lobs iii the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of purchased business combinations iv the quarterly variances between the company’s actual costs of certain of its selfinsured integrated risk and employee benefit programs and amounts charged to the lobs and v certain adjustments relating to costs associated with the company’s international defined benefit pension plans in addition “unallocated corporate items” includes adjustments to contract margins both positive and negative associated with projects where it has been determined in the opinion of management that such adjustments are not indicative of the performance of the related lob and therefore should not be attributed to the lob

segment operating results

in evaluating the company’s performance by operating segment the chief operating decision maker reviews various metrics and statistical data for each lob but focuses primarily on revenues and operating profit as discussed above segment operating profit includes not only local sga expenses but also the sga expenses of the company’s support groups that have been allocated to the segments in addition the company allocates portions of the company’s cash and equity incentive plans to the lobs the revenues of certain lobs are more affected by passthrough revenues than other lobs the methods for recognizing revenue incentive fees project losses and change orders are consistent among the lobs

aerospace  technology

 



 

aerospace  technology revenues for the fiscal year ended september 30 2016 decreased 2673 million or 91 to 27 billion from 29 billion in fiscal 2015 the decrease was due in part to some of our us government customers’ shift to a smallbusiness preference in contract awards which was partially mitigated by stronger revenues in our uk nuclear and defense markets

page 41

 

aerospace  technology revenues for the year ended october 2 2015 increased 6183 million or 268 to 29 billion from 23 billion in fiscal 2014 the increase was primarily due to the fns acquisition completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014

operating profit for the year ended september 30 2016 decreased 16 million or 08 to 2038 million from 2054 million in fiscal 2015 the slight decrease in operating profit was due to lower volumes in fiscal 2016 described above but was mostly mitigated by improving our performance on fixed price contracts operating margin for fiscal 2016 improved to 77 compared to 70 respectively in fiscal 2015 the improvement in operating margin was due to additional fees on our nuclear work for the uk government the replacement of lower margin work with higher margin contracts and our continued focus on overall profitability

operating profit for the year ended october 2 2015 increased 657 million or 470 to 2054 million from 1397 million in fiscal 2014 the increase in operating profit was due primarily to the acquisition described above and an increase in nuclear and defense work in the uk as a result operating margin for the year ended october 2 2015 improved to 70 compared to 61 in fiscal 2014 

buildings  infrastructure

 



 

buildings  infrastructure revenues for the year ended september 30 2016 decreased 2049 million or 83 to 23 billion from 25 billion in fiscal 2015 the decrease was primarily due to reduced us and uk client spending in certain markets during fiscal 2016

 

buildings  infrastructure revenues for the year ended october 2 2015 decreased 2468 million or 91 to 25 billion from 27 billion in fiscal 2014 the decrease was primarily due to the decline in our energy and power business in the asia pacific region

operating profit for the year ended september 30 2016 increased 293 million or 202 from 1453 million in fiscal 2015 to 1746 million proactive cost control and restructuring efforts contributed to the increase in operating profit for fiscal 2016 as compared to the corresponding period last year as a result operating margin for fiscal 2016 improved to 78 compared to 59 in fiscal 2015

operating profit for the year ended october 2 2015 decreased 191 million or 116 to 1453 million from 1644 million in fiscal 2014 the decrease in operating profit was due to the decline in energy and power business as a result operating margin for the year ended october 2 2015 declined to 59 compared to 61 in fiscal 2014

industrial

 



industrial revenues for the year ended september 30 2016 increased 2761 million or 110 to 28 billion from 25 billion in fiscal 2015 the increase was primarily due to new life sciences projects offset by a decline in the mining  minerals business due to weak market conditions

industrial revenues for the year ended october 2 2015 decreased 4388 million or 148 to 25 billion from 30 billion in fiscal 2014 the decrease was primarily due to a decline in the mining  minerals and field services business due to weak market conditions

page 42

operating profit for the year ended september 30 2016 decreased 453 million or 358 to 813 million from 1265 million in fiscal 2015 the decrease was due to the decline in the mining  minerals business and was caused primarily by a negotiated settlement of a project c laim that occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 combined with the negative effects of a litigation settlement affecting the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and a customer bankruptcy these decreases were offset in part by the increases in the life sc iences market and benefits associated with the 2015 restructuring although driven by discrete items in each of the periods presented the change in operating profit was negative as a result operating margin for fiscal 2016 declined to 29 from 50 fo r the corresponding period last year 

operating profit for the year ended october 2 2015 decreased 77 million or 57 to 1265 million from 1342 million in fiscal 2014 the decrease in operating profit was due to the decline in the mining  minerals business driven by lower revenues as a result of weak market conditions operating margin for the year ended october 2 2015 increased to 50 compared to 45 in fiscal 2014 the decrease in operating margin was driven primarily by a better project mix in the specialty chemical  manufacturing markets and lower pass through revenue in field services

petroleum  chemicals

 



 

petroleum  chemicals revenues for the year ended september 30 2016 decreased 9546 million or 227 to 33 billion from 42 billion in fiscal 2015 petroleum  chemicals revenues for the year ended october 2 2015 decreased 5130 million or 109 to 42 billion from 47 billion in fiscal 2014 the decrease in both comparable annual periods was primarily due to lower business volume in the oil  gas market sector and to a lesser extent the refining market sector particularly in the middle east and north america as weak oil prices have significantly impacted client capital spending and delayed the pace of new contract awards

operating profit for the year ended september 30 2016 decreased 117 million or 85 to 1266 million from 1384 million in fiscal 2015 the decrease in operating profit was due to lower volume in the oil and gas and refining market sectors offset in part by significant savings from restructuring efforts and lob structure efficiencies a continued strong focus on cost reductions has partially mitigated the volume reduction impact on operating profit as a result operating margin for the year ended september 30 2016 increased to 39 from 33 in fiscal 2015

operating profit for the year ended october 2 2015 decreased 241 million or 148 to 1384 million from 1625 million in fiscal 2014 the decrease in operating profit was due to lower business volume partially offset by restructuring actions to lower the lob cost structure as a result operating margin for the year ended october 2 2015 declined to 33 compared to 34 in fiscal 2014 

consolidated results

fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015

direct costs of contracts decreased 10 billion or 94 from 101 billion during fiscal 2015 to 92 billion during fiscal 2016 direct costs of contracts include all costs incurred in connection with and directly for the benefit of client contracts including depreciation and amortization relating to assets used in connection with providing the services required by client projects the level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors including the amount of passthrough costs we incur during a period on those projects where we are responsible for subcontract labor or third party materials and equipment we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs and we refer to such costs as “passthrough costs” on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not considered passthrough costs and are therefore not reflected in either revenues or costs to the extent that we incur a significant amount of passthrough costs in a period our direct cost of contracts are likely to increase as well the decrease in direct costs of contracts between fiscal years 2015 and 2016 is primarily a result of the general decline in our business

passthrough costs decreased 1127 million or 43 from 26 billion during fiscal 2015 to 25 billion for fiscal 2016 in general passthrough costs are more significant on projects that have a higher content of field services activities 

page 43

passthrough costs are generally incurred at a specific point in the lifecycle of a project and are highly dependent on the needs of our individual clients and the nature of the clients’ projects however because we have hundreds of projects w hich start at various times within a fiscal year the effect of passthrough costs on the level of direct costs of contracts can vary between fiscal years without there being a fundamental or significant change to the underlying business 

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts were 839 for fiscal 2016 compared to 838 for fiscal 2015 the relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided generally speaking the more procurement we do on behalf of our clients ie where we purchase equipment and materials for use on projects andor procure subcontracts in connection with projects and the more field services revenues we have relative to technical professional services revenues the higher the ratio will be of direct costs of contracts to revenues because revenues from passthrough costs typically have lower margin rates associated with them it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in such revenues without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit the ratio of direct costs of contracts to revenues was flat over the prior year period the company experienced a slight decrease in margins in fiscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015

selling general and administrative sga expenses for fiscal 2016 decreased by 936 million or 6 to 143 billion compared to 152 billion for fiscal 2015 the decrease in sga expenses was primarily due to higher sga savings associated with the 2015 restructuring excluding the effects of the 2015 restructuring in both fiscal 2016 and 2015 adjusted sga expenses for fiscal 2016 decreased 1269 million or 9 to 124 billion from 137 billion in fiscal 2015

net interest expense for fiscal 2016 decreased 48 million to 74 million from 122 million in fiscal 2015 included in net interest expense for fiscal 2016 was a reversal of 27 million of accrued interest expense related to the statute expiration of a foreign tax reserve interest expense for fiscal 2016 was also lower when compared to the same period last year due to lower debt levels

loss on disposal of business and investments for fiscal 2016 increased by 385 million to 414 million from 29 million in fiscal 2015 the increase is due to the previously discussed loss on the sale of our french subsidiary of 244 million and a noncash writeoff on an equity investment of 170 million

miscellaneous expense for fiscal 2016 increased 28 million to 31 million from 02 million in fiscal 2015 the increase over the prior year period was primarily due to realized exchange rate losses included in miscellaneous expense for fiscal 2016 was a reversal of 51 million of accrued penalties related to the statute expiration of a foreign tax reserve

the companys effective income tax rate for fiscal 2016 increased to 252 from 235 in fiscal 2015 contributing to the increase in the effective tax rate when compared to the prior year is the absence of a 231 million nonrecurring benefit related to a foreign currency loss in 2015 also contributing to the increase is an 89 million charge related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets due to a statutory tax rate change in the united kingdom offsetting the fiscal 2016 effective tax rate increases was a 112 million benefit related to a valuation allowance release a 69 million benefit due to a prior period adjustment to income taxes payable and a 87 million benefit recorded upon the filing of a us amended tax return to claim additional foreign tax credits and internal revenue code section 179d benefit for the design of energy efficient buildings

fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014

the companys gaap net earnings for fiscal 2015 decreased by 251 million or 76 compared to fiscal 2014 included in net earnings for fiscal 2015 is the onetime tax benefit of 231 million or 018 per share related to the 2015 intercompany debt refinancing

the companys results for fiscal 2015 when compared to the prior year were positively impacted by i the skm acquisition which is included for all of fiscal 2015 compared to approximately nine and a half months in fiscal 2014 and to a lesser degree ii the other acquisitions completed during fiscal 2014 also influencing the comparability of the companys fiscal 2015 results of operations to fiscal 2014 were the 2015 restructuring and the 2014 events below

page 44









 

revenues decreased 5803 million or 46 from 127 billion for fiscal 2014 to 121 billion for fiscal 2015 revenues for fiscal year 2015 include a negative impact of 5610 million related to the strengthening of the us dollar

direct costs of contracts decreased 4749 million or 45 from 1062 billion during fiscal 2014 to 1015 billion during fiscal 2015 passthrough costs decreased 3522 million or 119 from 295 billion during fiscal 2014 to 260 billion for fiscal 2015

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts were 838 for fiscal 2015 compared to 837 for fiscal 2014 the ratio of direct costs of contracts to revenues was flat over the prior year period 

selling general and administrative sga expenses for fiscal 2015 decreased by 229 million or 15 to 152 billion compared to 155 billion for fiscal 2014 the decrease in sga expenses was primarily due to lower costs stemming from the 2014 events which were partially offset by increased costs related to the 2015 restructuring excluding the effects of the 2015 restructuring and the 2014 events adjusted sga expenses for fiscal 2015 decreased 674 million or 47 to 137 billion from 144 billion for the corresponding period last year

net interest expense for fiscal 2015 increased 105 million to 122 million from 17 million in fiscal 2014 included in net interest expense for fiscal 2014 was the reversal of 41 million of accrued interest expense recorded in connection with income tax liabilities relating to certain contested international tax matters which were favorably resolved during the first quarter of fiscal 2014

page 45

the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate was 252 for fiscal 2016 compared to 235 in fiscal 2015 contributing to the increase in the effective tax rate when compa red to the prior year is the absence of a 231 million nonrecurring benefit related to foreign currency loss in 2015 the fiscal 2016 effective tax rate is lower than the statutory rate due to an 112 million benefit related to a valuation allowance rel ease a 69 million benefit due to a prior period adjustment to income taxes payable and an 87 million benefit recorded upon the filing of a us amended tax return to claim additional foreign tax credits and an irc section 179d benefit for the design of energy efficient buildings offsetting the current year benefits was an 89 million expense charge related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets due to a statutory tax rate change in the united kingdom 

contractual obligations

the following table sets forth certain information about our contractual obligations as of september 30 2016 in thousands

 



 











backlog information

backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us we include in backlog the entire value of contracts at the time the contracts are awarded to us or when we have otherwise been authorized by the client to proceed with the services required by the contracts with respect to om contracts however we include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for only one succeeding year regardless of the remaining life of the contract for national government programs other than us federal om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding option periods in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client in a situation where a client terminates a contract we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination in addition it is not unusual for clients to change the scope of services required by the contract over the life of the project accordingly backlog can fluctuate from one reporting period to the next due to the timing of when new contracts are added to backlog and when the contract revenue is recognized in our consolidated financial statements many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years

page 46

please refer to item 1a— risk factors  above for a discussion of other factors that may cause backlog to ultimately convert into revenues at different amounts 

the following table summarizes our backlog for each of the last three fiscal years in millions 

 



 

our backlog at september 30 2016 decreased by 46 million or 02 to 188 billion from 188 billion at october 2 2015 the decrease in backlog from october 2 2015 to september 30 2016 was due primarily to new awards from clients operating in the chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries offset in part by an approximate 1826 million reduction due to foreign exchange

backlog in the aerospace  technology lob at september 30 2016 was  511 billion up  2292 million or 1804 million after the effect of exchange rate changes when compared to the backlog at october 2 2015 the yearoveryear increase in backlog was primarily from an increase in new awards from the us federal government

backlog in the buildings  infrastructure lob at september 30 2016 was 503 billion up 3105 million or 2176 million after the effect of exchange rate changes when compared to the backlog at october 2 2015 the yearoveryear increase in backlog was primarily from new awards in the us buildings and infrastructure market

backlog in the industrial lob at september 30 2016 was 311 billion down 5439 million or 4495 million after the effect of exchange rate changes when compared to the backlog at october 2 2015 the yearoveryear decrease in backlog was primarily related to a lower level of field services awards

backlog in the petroleum  chemicals lob at september 30 2016 was 551 billion down 418 million or 53 million after the effect of exchange rate changes when compared to the backlog at october 2 2015 the yearoveryear decrease in backlog was primarily related to weak oil process affecting our customers’ capital spend

backlog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies totaled approximately 48 billion or 254 of total backlog 46 billion or 239 of total backlog and 39 billion or 229 of total backlog at september 30 2016 october 2 2015 and september 26 2014 respectively most of our federal contracts require that services be provided beyond one year in general these contracts must be funded annually ie the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the us congress to the procuring agency and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts

we estimate that approximately 77 billion or 4128 of total backlog at september 30 2016 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year

effects of inflation

the effects of inflation on our business is discussed in item 1a— risk factors  and is incorporated herein by reference

liquidity and capital resources

at september 30 2016 our primary sources of liquidity consisted of 6557 million of cash and cash equivalents and 121 billion of available borrowing capacity under our 16 billion revolving credit facility the 2014 facility

additional information regarding the 2014 facility is set forth in note 6  borrowings in notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k we finance as much of our operations and growth as possible through cash generated by our operations

page 47

during fiscal 2016 our cash and cash equivalents increased by 1949 million from 4609 million at october 2 2015 to 6557 million at september 30 2016 this compares to a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 2718 million during fiscal 2015 during fiscal 2016 we experienced net cash inflows of 68 02 million from operating activities offset by outflows of 3170 million from financing activities 1396 million from investing activities and 287 million from the effects of exchange rate changes 

operations provided net cash of 6802 million during fiscal 2016 this compares to net cash inflows of 4846 million and 7217 million during fiscal 2015 and 2014 respectively the 1956 million increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 was due primarily to a 3731 million favorable change in the companys working capital accounts partially offset by a  1144 million decrease in net earnings attributable to the group

because such a high percentage of our revenues are earned on costplus type contracts and due to the significance of revenues relating to passthrough costs most of the costs we incur are included in invoices we send to clients although we continually monitor our accounts receivable we manage the operating cash flows of the company by managing the working capital accounts in total rather than by the individual elements the primary elements of the company’s working capital accounts are accounts receivable accounts payable and billings in excess of cost accounts payable consists of obligations to third parties relating primarily to costs incurred for projects which are generally billable to clients accounts receivable consist of billings to our clients — a substantial portion of which is for projectrelated costs billings in excess of cost consist of billings to and payments from our clients for costs yet to be incurred

this relationship between revenues and costs and between receivables and payables is unique to our industry and facilitates review of our liquidity at the total working capital level the 3731 million increase in cash flows relating to our working capital accounts during fiscal 2016 is indicative of our building momentum to become more effective in our working capital performance

with respect to the company’s trade accounts receivable while our credit risk could be significant based on the fact that we provide services to clients operating in a wide range of industries as well as in a number of countries outside the us we manage these issues closely to reduce exposures as much as possible and historically have not experienced material losses nevertheless and as disclosed previously the company incurred a loss during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 relating to the bankruptcy of a client of the industrial lob our private sector customers include large wellknown and wellestablished multinational companies and our government customers consist of national state and local agencies located principally in the us the uk and australia although we have not historically experienced significant collection issues with any of our governmental or commercial customers we are currently reassessing how we extend credit to certain customers and markets that we service

we used 1396 million of cash and cash equivalents for investing activities during fiscal 2016 this compares to 961 million and 15 billion during fiscal 2015 and 2014 respectively the increase in investing activities in fiscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily the result of two small acquisitions in fiscal 2016 and the cash used in the sale of jacobs france subsidiary the acquisition activity in fiscal 2014 was primarily related to the companys acquisition of skm for 12 billion 11 billion net of cash acquired 

additions to property and equipment totaled 677 million 884 million and 1321 million for fiscal years 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively included in fiscal 2015 and 2014 activity are significant expenditures for leasehold improvements relating primarily to the consolidation of certain office space expansion of office space and relocations of certain office space all occurring in a number of locations

our financing activities resulted in net cash outflow of 3170 million during fiscal 2016 as compared to net cash outflow of 5533 million and net cash inflow of 3049 million during fiscal 2015 and 2014 respectively the 2363 million in incremental cash inflow during fiscal 2016 as compared to the previous year was due primarily to a 2698 million decrease in cash used to repurchased shares of company common stock discussed in further detail in part ii item 5 of this annual report on form 10k the 8582 million in incremental cash outflows during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was due primarily to a 5027 million increase in cash used to payoff longterm debt during fiscal 2015 combined with a 3439 million increase in cash used to repurchase shares of company common stock 

the company had 6557 million of cash and shortterm equivalents at september 30 2016 of this amount approximately 1492 million was held in the us and 5065 million was held outside of the us primarily in canada the uk and the eurozone other than the tax cost of repatriating funds held outside the us to the us see note 10— income 

page 48

taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k there are no impediments to repatriating these funds to the us 

the total amount utilized under the 2014 facility at september 30 2016 was 3878 million 3853 million in the form of direct borrowings and 25 million utilized in the form of letters of credit please refer to note 6— borrowings of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding the 2014 facility

we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations support our acquisition strategy support the existing share repurchase authorization and service our debt for the next twelve months we had 6557 million in cash and cash equivalents at september 30 2016 compared to 4609 million at october 2 2015 our consolidated working capital position at september 30 2016 was 108 billion a decrease of 597 million from october 2 2015

additionally there was 121 billion of borrowing capacity available at september 30 2016 under the 2014 facility we believe that the remaining capacity terms and conditions of the 2014 facility combined with cash onhand and the other committed and uncommitted facilities we have in place are adequate for our working capital and general business requirements

the company had 2560 million of letters of credit outstanding at september 30 2016 of this amount 25 million were issued under the 2014 facility and 2535 million were issued under separate committed and uncommitted letterofcredit facilities

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409— revenue from contracts with customers  the new guidance provided by asu 201409 is intended to remove inconsistencies and perceived weaknesses in the existing revenue requirements provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues improve comparability provide information that is more useful and simplify the preparation of financial statements asu 201409 was initially effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 on july 9 2015 the fasb approved a oneyear deferral of the effective date of this standard the revised effective date for the standard is for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods therein the fasb also approved changes allowing for early adoption of the standard as of the original effective date the company has completed its initial assessment of the new standard and is in the process of developing a plan to assess its contracts with customers the company currently intends to adopt the new standard using the modified retrospective application this standard could have a significant impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and an administrative impact on its operations the company will further assess the impact through its implementation program

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602— leases  asu 201602 requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases asu 201602 is effective for public entity financial statements for annual periods beginning after december 15 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods early adoption is permitted including adoption in an interim period the guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements the company is evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements this standard could have a significant impact on the company’s

consolidated financial statements and an administrative impact on its operations the company will further assess the impact through its implementation program 

in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201609— improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  asu 201609 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including the income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows asu 201609 is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period for which financial statements have not been issued or made available for issuance if an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period any adjustments must be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period an entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period the company is evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements and does not expect it to have a material impact

during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 the company adopted the provisions of asu 201517— balance sheet classification of deferred taxes on a retrospective basis for all periods presented asu 201517 removes the requirement to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position instead the update requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position as a result of the company’s adoption of asu 201517 in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 the current deferred taxes and noncurrent deferred tax assets included in miscellaneous noncurrent assets on the october 2 2015 consolidated balance sheet were reclassified to noncurrent deferred taxes which increased noncurrent deferred tax assets by 1603 million and decreased miscellaneous noncurrent assets by 2138 million

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

the company’s management with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined by rule 13a15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of september 30 2016 the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k the “evaluation date” based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were functioning effectively as of the evaluation date to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the company in reports filed under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act management with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the evaluation date based on the framework established in “internal control—integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework based on this evaluation management has concluded that the company’s internal controls over financial reporting as of the evaluation date were effective the company’s independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting which appears later in this annual report on form 10k

page 51

changes in internal control 

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the company’s fiscal quarter ended september 30 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting

limitations on effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its system of internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed or operated can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of internal control are met the design of the company’s control system reflects the fact that there are resource constraints and that the benefits of such control systems must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control failures and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the intentional acts of individuals by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that the design of any particular control will always succeed in achieving its objective under all potential future conditions

business

general background information 

we are one of the largest technical professional services firms in the world we provide a diverse range of technical professional and construction services to a large number of industrial commercial and governmental clients we provide four broad categories of services 

 

 

 

 

we focus our services on clients operating in the following industries and markets 

 

 

 

 

 

page 3 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we are headquartered in pasadena california usa and provide our services through more than 200 offices located around the globe primarily in north america south america europe the middle east india australia africa and asia 

how we operate 

the relationships we have with our clients drive our business as a broadbased technical professional services firm we offer a range of services to help our clients maintain a competitive edge in their respective markets from feasibility studies to design to engineering to construction to startup and commissioning and then to operations and maintenance we customize our services to meet business and project goals our global network of professionals works with a multioffice approach in an effort to provide clients with the best most economical project or program solutions 

we strive to provide client value through continuous improvement in our performance we regularly monitor our clients expectations our project delivery protocols and system and our operational performance tools such as our jacobs value enhancing practices global standard operating procedures project reviews the jacobs system to ensure project success jsteps and safe plans of action spas provide added value to our clients projects they also allow us to create performance improvement actions during the project execution through continuous improvement upon our performance our tools and our processes we believe we can offer our clients superior value when they do business with us 

jacobsvalue sm value plus is an internal tool we use to document and quantify the actual value or savings we provide to our clients and their projects some of the benefits achieved through the value plus program include lower total installed cost shorter schedule and reduced life cycle cost value plus is implemented at project initiation a project goal is created and costsaving ideas are entered into the value plus database when the value plus cycle is complete the project team and client identify unique cost andor schedule reductions for the project 

our business model 

our organizational structure and integrated system for delivering services are key components of our business strategy our operating units generally use a matrix organizational structure whereby our project management functions are supported by the various technical planning design and construction disciplines that are necessary to effectively execute longterm engineering and construction contracts we recognize that technical expertise alone cannot grow our business project management skills and the ability to manage multimillion dollar projects and programs for our clients are critical to our success crucial functions such as project controls and procurement are embedded within each of our regions and serve operations by providing specialized services required by projects 

our business is set up to foster cooperation among teams and across our operating units historically we have not operated “profit centers” within the company nor do we allow our operating groups to compete against each other for contracts our organizational structure and integrated system for delivering services are key components of our business strategy the following three ideas support our business model 

multidomestic approach 

we work in many countries with locallystaffed offices that share a common set of values tools and a single vision while maintaining oneonone contact with individual clients this multidomestic approach enables us to provide customized service suited to the locale while still taking advantage of the company’s global network 

boundaryless approach 

page 4 

our diversity encompasses our people geographic reach expertise and technical capabilities on projects around the world we enhance local expertise with the best talent and the best technology available anywhere throughout the company this seamless boundaryless approach keeps us flexible and enhances our ability to develop the best possible solutions for our clients regardless of office or project location 

cost management approach 

as the global economy expands and companies providing technical professional and construction services are required to compete against each other across geographic boundaries companies that can provide their clients with costefficient solutions to their project needs have the advantage with a strong focus on managing costs we provide savings to clients and deliver superior technical professional and construction services safely efficiently and within the cost and time parameters our clients require 

jacobs’ corporate functions include project delivery safety finance and administration legal human resources information technology compliance and through fiscal 2015 global sales and marketing which are all integral to our success 

the companys culture 

our employees are our most important and valuable asset and therefore the prevention of jobrelated injuries is given top priority it is the policy of the company to provide and maintain a safe and healthy working environment and to follow operating practices that safeguard all employees and result in a more efficient operation beyondzero®  the name of our program that promotes our culture of caring moves beyond efforts to have an incident and injuryfree safety performance we implement a culture of caring where concern for employees health safety and welfare extends outside the office walls beyond the project site fences and into their homes cars and all the places where they interact with family friends and fellow employees 

since jacobs’ founding the company has been based on doing business honestly ethically and with the utmost integrity our culture and our code of conduct that is signed annually by all employees prescribes that everyone at the company must adhere to jacobs’ core values and ethical code and comply with the laws that govern the company’s activities worldwide our employees and business partners are expected to follow the highest principles of business conduct integrity and ethics as they carry out their responsibilities and are guided by the following principles in carrying out their responsibilities loyalty compliance with applicable laws observance of ethical standards avoidance of conflicts of interest and communication we endeavor to deal fairly with our employees customers suppliers and competitors and to respect the policies and procedures of those outside the company 

we strive to present a clear and consistent image of our company to our clients employees shareholders and business partners  regarding how we behave how we communicate how we look and most importantly how our promises to our clients are delivered  anywhere in the world 

we accomplish this foremost through our core values which allow us to behave as one company and unify us worldwide by keeping our core values as a central focus of our company we are able to think the same way and arrive at similar conclusions regardless of our physical location our core values are 

 

 

   

the balance inherent in our core values is also evident in our approach to sustainability which maintains an even balance among the people the economics and the environmental aspects of business jacobs is driven to continuously improve efficiencies and reduce energy and resources practices that drive down costs and contribute to a lower impact on the environment the company adheres to the following seven sus tainability principles 

 

 

page 5 

 

 

 

 

 

applying the best most efficient and effective sustainable solutions for clients worldwide in all major industries in which our clients operate allows us to make a significant contribution to a safe and sustainable future each year we issue a sustainability report  that describes many of our efforts and accomplishments regarding environmental sustainability 

  

with respect to human resources our goal is to establish an inclusive diverse workplace that energizes the people who fuel our companys growth although we are a large company with over 64000  employees in over 25  countries our employees are unified in their focus on superior value safety and ethical business practices regardless of the country in which they work and employees frequently move around the system as they grow their careers 

how we grow 

jacobs has grown significantly since its founding in 1947 both through organic growth and through strategic acquisitions an important part of the company’s growth strategy we have acquired and integrated numerous companies over the years that have enhanced our capabilities geographic reach and offerings 

in terms of organic growth our relationshipbased business model is central to our sustained growth and profitability we pursue the development of longterm relationships and alliances with our clients by working with our clients on their capital programs we increase our understanding of their overall business needs as well as the unique technical requirements of their specific projects this increased understanding enables us we believe to provide superior value to our clients our approach provides us with opportunities to market the services our clients are expected to need in the predesign phase such as master planning permitting or project finance options in the design phase and in the construction poststartup and commissioning phases of a facility including operations and maintenance services 

our relationships with clients also present ongoing opportunities to expand into adjacent markets for example clients operating in the mining and minerals market often have a need for our infrastructure and buildings capabilities the same is true for clients operating in other markets 

we market our services to clients in a wide range of public and institutional process and industrial markets we increase our opportunities through selective market diversity and are able to price contracts more competitively and enhance overall profitability while delivering additional value to our clients by integrating and bundling our services in complex economic times we have the ability to evolve along with market cycles worldwide when opportunities decrease in a particular market or geography other opportunities often increase because of our selective market diversity we believe we are wellpositioned to address a wide range of opportunities across many markets and geographies which helps us grow our business 

closely linked to our relationshipbased business model is our multidomestic geographic strategy our core clients can depend on us for assistance with their engineering and construction needs when they move projects around the world we therefore follow our clients into new geographic regions which helps us perform meaningful portions of their projects by utilizing local resources rather than exporting the work to other offices 

page 6 

the role of acquisitions and strategic investments in the development our business 

when we review acquisition targets we are conscious of the effect the acquisition may have on our client base we favor acquisitions that allow us to i expand into a new client market ii enhance the range of services we provide existing clients andor iii access new geographic areas in which our clients either already operate or plan to expand by expanding into new geographic areas and adding to our existing technical and project management capabilities we strive to position ourselves as a preferred singlesource provider of technical professional and construction services to our major clients the following is a brief description of some of our recent key acquisitions in reverse chronological order

technical training services and contingent workforce services to the automotive manufacturing industry the business is headquartered in detroit michigan 

 

 

 

 

 

   

after we complete an acquisition we move quickly to integrate the newly acquired operations we typically assign senior operations personnel to manage the overall integration process with assistance from our sales accounting legal it human resources and risk management departments although integrating newly acquired businesses can be very challenging the assimilation process is critical in order to assure i that our global businesses processes and systems are properly deployed throughout the newlyacquired entities and ii that we can begin to leverage off the acquired talents skills and expertise to grow our business and help our clients execute their capital programs newlyacquired businesses are generally not left as standalone entities within the company’s internal reporting system the businesses we acquire are typically folded in to existing operational organizations within the company for additional information regarding certain issues related to our acquisition strategy please refer to item 1a— risk factors below 

financial information about segments 

although we describe our business in this annual report on form 10k in terms of the various services we provide the markets in which our clients operate and the geographic areas in which we operate we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment pursuant to those accounting principles generally accepted in the us “us gaap” in making this determination we considered the various economic characteristics of our operations including the nature of the services we provide the nature of our internal processes for delivering and distributing those services and the types of customers we have in addition to the discussion that follows please refer to note 14 — segment information  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

page 8 

there is a high degree of similarity among the workforces employed across the categories of services we provide for example professionals in engineering and design services ie services provided by persons who are degreed and in certain circumstances licensed such as engineers architects scientists and economists exist in all four service categories in addition there is a high degree of similarity among a significant component of the workforces we employ to perform construction and operations and maintenance om projects in providing construction and om services we employ a large number of skilled craft labor personnel these may include welders pipe fitters electricians crane operators and other personnel who work on very large capital projects in the case of projects classified within the construction services category or on smaller capital projects in the case of maintenance projects classified within the om services category 

all of our offices use a matrix organizational structure our results therefore are dependent on groups representing technical disciplines eg electrical engineering mechanical engineering cost engineering etc supporting project management personnel who maintain the relationship between our clients and us and are ultimately responsible for delivering projects to our clients safely on time and on budget additionally our operating regions use common tools policies and procedures to manage and run their respective units these include project review meetings project performance evaluations and project execution plans 

  

each of the companys operating regions provides most of the services the company offers generally and each of our operating regions includes in its customer base many of the same or similar clients as our other regions 

  

the use of technology throughout our organization is highly uniform whether it is computeraided design and drafting “cadd” applications used by our engineering and design staff or modeling programs used by the scientific and consulting staff or scheduling estimating and cost control applications used by homeoffice personnel in support of our construction and maintenance activities all of the service categories described above are equally affected by changes in technology as they occur in the economy at large 

furthermore the types of information and internal reports used by the company’s chief operating decision maker the “codm” who is also the company’s chief executive officer and other members of management to monitor performance evaluate results of operations allocate resources and otherwise manage the business support a single reportable segment accordingly based on these similarities we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment for purposes of the disclosures included in this annual report on form 10k 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 we announced a reorganization of our operations around four global lines of business this reorganization is intended to better serve our global clients leverage our workforce help streamline operations and provide enhanced growth opportunities the four global lines of business are petroleum  chemicals buildings  infrastructure aerospace  technology and industrial each business unit has a president that reports directly to the companys president  ceo as part of the reorganization certain support functions ie sales which have been managed centrally for many years will be embedded in the new business units and will report to the respective line of business presidents the costs of other support functions eg accounting legal human resources and information technology and certain other activities eg global insurance will either be assigned or allocated to each new business unit using a rationale method of assignmentallocation or will remain an element of corporate general and administrative expenses in addition the company has significantly modified its major cash incentive plan utilizing forecasted performance metrics aligned along the new lines of business we are in the process of modifying our systems and work processes to report the results of these business units in an accurate and timely manner we are also developing processes for accurately eliminating interunit revenue and profit we expect to complete our system and other process changes so that we may accurately report operating results by line of business to the companys president  ceo no later than the second quarter of fiscal 2016

services provided 

as described above the services we provide generally fall into the following four broad categories project services process scientific and systems consulting services construction services and operations and maintenance services 

  

the following table sets forth our revenues from each of our four service categories for each of the last five fiscal years in thousands 



project services 

we employ the engineering architecture interiors design planning and related disciplines necessary to design and engineer modern process plants buildings infrastructure projects technology and manufacturing facilities consumer products manufacturing facilities power plants and stations pulp and paper plants and other facilities 

we are capable of providing our clients with a variety of value engineering services including safety in design through safety in design we integrate best practices hazard analysis and risk assessment methods early in the design phase of projects taking those steps necessary to eliminate or mitigate injury and damage during the construction startup testing and commissioning and operations phases of a project 

in the area of construction management we provide our clients with a wide range of services as an agent for our clients we may act as program director whereby we oversee on the owners behalf the complete planning design and construction phases of the project alternatively our services may be limited to providing construction consulting 

project services also includes planning scheduling procurement estimating cost engineering project accounting 

project delivery quality safety and all other key support services needed for complete cradletograve project delivery 

process scientific and systems consulting services 

we employ the professional and technical skills and expertise with respect to a broad range of consulting services including performing pricing studies market analyses and financial projections necessary in determining the feasibility of a project performing gasoline reformulation modeling analyzing and evaluating layout and mechanical designs for complex processing plants analyzing automation and control systems analyzing designing and executing biocontainment strategies developing and performing process protocols with respect to the us food and drug administrationmandated qualification and validation requirements and performing geological and metallurgical studies 

also included in this service category are revenues relating to defense and aerospacerelated programs such services typically are more technical and scientific in nature than other project services we provide and may involve such tasks as supporting the development and testing of conventional weapons systems weapons modeling and simulations computer systems development maintenance and support evaluation and testing of missioncritical control systems aerospace testing and propulsion systems and facilities and other highly technical or scientific tasks 

construction services 

in addition to the construction management services included under project services above we provide traditional field construction services to private and public sector clients we also provide modular construction consulting services in the area of environmental remediation and restoration we also provide environmental remedial construction services for a variety of public and private sector clients 

historically our field construction activities have been focused primarily on those construction projects for which we perform much of the related engineering and design work by focusing our construction efforts in this way we attempt to minimize the risks associated with constructing complex projects based on designs prepared by third parties the financial risk 

page 10 

to us of constructing complex assets based on designs prepared by third parties may be particularly significant on fixedprice contracts therefore we generally avoid this type of project however we will pursue constructiononly projects when we can negotiate pricing and other contract terms we deem acceptable and which we believe can result in a fair return for the degree of risk we assume 

operations and maintenance services 

om refers to all of the tasks required to operate and maintain large complex facilities on behalf of clients we provide key management and support services over all aspects of the operations of a facility including managing subcontractors and other onsite personnel om also includes process plant maintenance services which generally involves all tasks required to keep a process plant typically a refinery or chemical plant in daytoday operation 

within the aerospace and defense areas om often requires us to provide the management and technical support services necessary to operate and maintain such sites as engine test facilities weapons integration facilities and hightech simulation and verification centers such om contracts also frequently require us to provide facilities management and maintenance services utilities operations and maintenance services property management and disposition services and construction support services 

within the environmental area om often includes engineering and technical support services as well as program management services necessary to remediate contaminated sites 

although the gross profit margins we realize from om services are generally lower than those associated with the other services we provide the costs to support maintenance activities are also generally lower also om services offer us an opportunity for longterm relationships with clients this aspect of om services greatly reduces the selling costs in respect of such services

backlog 

backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us with respect to om contracts however we include in backlog the 

page 15 

amount of revenues we expect to receive for only one succeeding year regardless of the remaining life of the contract for national government programs other than us federal om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding option periods in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation termination or suspension at the discretion of the client in addition the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts accordingly backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings 

our backlog includes expected revenues for contracts that are based on estimates for additional information regarding our backlog including those risk factors specific to backlog please refer to item 1a — risk factors  and item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  below our backlog at october 2 2015  and september 26 2014  was 188 billion  and 184 billion  respectively subject to the factors discussed in item 1a— risk factors  below we estimate that approximately 73 billion  or 386  of total backlog at october 2 2015  will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year 

  

significant customers 

the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government for each of the last five fiscal years   



given the percentage of total revenue derived from the us federal government the loss of us federal government agencies as customers would have a material adverse effect on the company in addition any or all of our government contracts could be terminated we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work or payment of our costs could be disallowed for more information on risks relating to our government contracts see item 1a  risk factors  below 

it is uncommon for a commercial customer to contribute 10 or more of the company’s total revenues on occasion however we will perform a number of field services projects for a single customer in the same fiscal year which primarily because of the amount of passthrough costs discussed below that is included in revenue will cause total revenue from that customer to exceed 10 of total consolidated revenues for additional information regarding certain risks related to our customer concentration please refer to item 1a — risk factors  below 

financial information about geographic areas 

selected financial information regarding the geographic areas in which we operate is included in note 14 — segment information  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k and is incorporated herein by reference for fiscal 2015  approximately 409  of our revenues was earned from clients outside the united states our international operations are subject to a variety of risks which are described under item 1a  risk factors below 

contracts 

while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake our contracts generally fall into two broad categories costreimbursable and fixedprice the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the last five fiscal years 

  



in accordance with industry practice most of our contracts including those with the us federal government are subject to termination at the discretion of the client which is discussed in greater detail in item 1a — risk factors in such situations our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination 

page 16 

when we are directly responsible for engineering design procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client’s plant or facility we reflect the costs of materials equipment and subcontracts in both revenues and costs on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs the following table sets forth the approximate amount of such passthrough costs included in revenues for each of the last five fiscal years in millions of dollars 

  



costreimbursable contracts 

costreimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit the profit element may be in the form of a simple markup applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee or a combination of a markup and a fee the fee element can also take several forms the fee may be a fixed amount it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred or it may be an incentive fee based on targets milestones or performance factors defined in the contract in general we prefer costreimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price 

fixedprice contracts 

fixedprice contracts include both “lump sum bid” contracts and “negotiated fixedprice” contracts under lump sum bid contracts we typically bid against other contractors based on specifications the client furnishes this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period additionally it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients which is contrary to our relationshipbased business model accordingly lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract and as such the company has rarely entered into individual lump sum bid contracts that are material to its financial results in contrast under a negotiated fixedprice contract we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client negotiated fixedprice contracts frequently exist in singleresponsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project thus although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us however because of economies that may be realized during the contract term both negotiated fixedprice and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts over the past five years most of our fixedprice work has been either negotiated fixedprice contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services rather than turnkey construction 

competition 

with respect to each of the four broad categories of services we provide we compete with a large number of companies across the world typically no single company or companies dominate the market in which we provide any such services we compete based on the following factors among others price of services technical capabilities reputation for quality safety record availability of qualified personnel ability to timely perform work and willingness to accept projectrelated risk for more information regarding the competitive conditions in our business please refer to item 1a— risk factors  below 

employees 

at october 2 2015  we had approximately 49900  fulltime staff employees including contract staff additionally as of october 2 2015  there were approximately 14100  persons employed in the field on a project basis the number of field employees varies in relation to the number and size of the maintenance and construction projects in progress at any particular time

 item 1a risk factors 

we operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future we may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial if any such events actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces if we fail to maintain safe work sites we can be exposed to significant financial losses and reputational harm as well as civil and criminal liabilities 

construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment moving vehicles chemical and manufacturing processes and highly regulated materials in a challenging environment on many sites we are responsible for safety and accordingly must implement safety procedures if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective our employees and others may become injured disabled or even lose their lives the completion or commencement of our projects may be delayed and we may be exposed to litigation or investigations unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover increase the cost of a project to our clients and raise our operating costs any of the foregoing could result in financial losses or reputational harm which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials which if improperly handled or disposed of could subject us to civil andor criminal liabilities we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health safety and environmental “hse” work procedures throughout our organization including construction sites and maintenance sites the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability in addition despite the work of our functional groups we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel or that there will be no damage to or loss of our work equipment or supplies 

our safety record is critical to our reputation many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures accordingly if we fail to maintain adequate safety standards we could suffer reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our vulnerability to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our clients operate is exacerbated during economic downturns or time of political uncertainty 

we provide technical professional construction and om services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration production and refining programs for various national governments including the us federal government chemicals and polymers mining and minerals pharmaceuticals and biotechnology infrastructure buildings power and other general industrial and consumer businesses and markets such as technology and manufacturing pulp and paper and food and consumer products these markets and the resulting demand for our services have been and we expect will continue to be cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control including economic conditions and changes in client spending particularly during periods of economic or political uncertainty 

current global economic and political conditions have negatively impacted many of our clients’ ability and willingness to fund their projects including their ability to raise capital and pay or timely pay our invoices they have also caused our clients to reduce their capital expenditures alter the mix of services purchased seek more favorable price and other contract terms and otherwise slow their spending on our services for example in the public sector declines in state and local tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending in addition due to these conditions many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable these conditions have reduced  and may continue to reduce the demand for our services which has had and may continue to have a significant negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

current economic and political conditions also make it extremely difficult for our clients our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could cause businesses to continue to slow spending on our services we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery worldwide or in our clients’ markets in addition our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and therefore may 

page 20 

not recover as quickly as the economy at large a continuation or worsening of current weak economic conditions or a reduction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

regardless of economic or market conditions investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients’ markets and investment decisions as a result our past results have varied and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate 

fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers’ investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation delays in existing work or changes in the timing and funding of new awards 

commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways for example for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil gas copper or fertilizers fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and therefore their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments to the extent commodity prices decline or fluctuate and our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects the demand for our services decreases which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned as well as those in progress and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our project execution activities may result in liability for faulty engineering services   

if we fail to provide our services in accordance with applicable professional standards we could be exposed to large damages or even criminal violations our engineering practice for example involves professional judgments regarding the planning design development construction operations and management of industrial facilities and public infrastructure projects while we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages in our contracts and although we have adopted a range of insurance risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities a catastrophic event at one of our project sites or completed projects resulting from the services we have performed could result in significant professional or product liability and warranty or other claims against us as well as reputational harm especially if public safety is impacted these liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or the fees we generate may not be covered by insurance at all due to various exclusions in our coverage and could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future further even where coverage applies the policies have deductibles which result in our assumption of exposure for a layer of coverage with respect to any claim filed by us in addition clients or subcontractors who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us an uninsured claim either in part or in whole as well as any claim covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible if successful and of a material magnitude could have a substantial impact on our operations 

we engage in a highly competitive business if we are unable to compete effectively we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

we face intense competition to provide technical professional and construction services to clients the extent of such competition varies by industry geographic market and project type for example with respect to our construction and operations and maintenance services clients generally award large projects to large contractors which may give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects conversely with respect to our engineering design architectural and consulting services low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller newer competitors the extent and type of competition varies by market and geographic area competition can place downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins and may force us to accept contractual terms and conditions that are less favorable to us thereby increasing the risk that we may not realize profit margins at the same rates as weve seen in the past if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both which if significant could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

page 21 

   our results of operations depend on the award of new contracts and the timing of the performance of these contracts 

our revenues are derived from new contract awards delays in the timing of the awards or cancellations of such prospects as a result of economic conditions material and equipment pricing and availability or other factors could impact our longterm projected results it is particularly difficult to predict whether or when we will receive largescale projects as these contracts frequently involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process which is affected by a number of factors such as market conditions governmental and environmental approvals since a significant portion of our revenues is generated from such projects our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards and the commencement or progress of work under awarded contracts in addition many of these contracts are subject to financing contingencies and as a result we are subject to the risk that the customer will not be able to secure the necessary financing for the project 

the uncertainty of our contract award timing can also present difficulties in matching workforce size with contract needs in some cases we maintain and bear the cost of a ready workforce that is larger than necessary under existing contracts in anticipation of future workforce needs for expected contract awards if an expected contract award is delayed or not received we may incur additional costs resulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are a party to litigation in the normal course of business since we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities and projects where design construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or others we are exposed to substantial claims and litigation and investigations if there is a failure at any such facility or project such claims could relate to among other things personal injury loss of life business interruption property damage pollution and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties such as those who use or reside near our clients’ projects we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met in many of our contracts with clients subcontractors and vendors we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages penalties losses and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts in addition while clients and subcontractors may agree to indemnify us against certain liabilities such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us 

we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations our insurance programs have varying exclusions coverage limits and maximums and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make in addition we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under these programs as a result we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured 

although in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future or that such insurance can be economically secured for example catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits more limited coverage increased premium costs or deductibles we monitor the financial health of the insurance companies from which we procure insurance and this is one of the factors we take into account when purchasing insurance our insurance is purchased from a number of the worlds leading providers often in layered insurance or quota share arrangements if any of our third party insurers fail abruptly cancel our coverage or otherwise cannot satisfy their insurance requirements to us then our overall risk exposure and operational expenses could be increased and our business operations could be interrupted 

in addition the nature of our business sometimes results in clients subcontractors and vendors presenting claims to us for among other things recovery of costs related to certain projects similarly we occasionally present change orders and claims to our clients subcontractors and vendors for among other things additional costs exceeding the original contract price if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients subcontractors and vendors we could incur cost overruns reduced profits or in some cases a loss for a project further these claims can be the subject of lengthy negotiations arbitration or litigation proceedings which could result in the investment of significant amounts of working capital pending the resolution of the relevant change orders and claims a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results additionally irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant 

page 22 

litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability product liability criminal liability warranty obligations and other liabilities which to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the nature of our contracts particularly those that are fixedprice subject us to risks of cost overruns we may experience reduced profits or in some cases losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates 

for fiscal 2015  approximately 170  of our revenues were earned under fixedprice contracts such contracts require us to estimate the total cost of the project in advance of our performance for these contracts we may benefit from any costsavings but we bear the risk of paying some if not all of any cost overruns fixedprice contract amounts are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions including those about future economic conditions prices and availability of labor equipment and materials and other exigencies if these estimates prove inaccurate there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications or if circumstances change due to among other things unanticipated technical problems difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals changes in local laws or labor conditions weather or other delays beyond our control changes in the costs of raw materials or our vendors’ or subcontractors’ inability or failure to perform then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or in some cases a loss for that project these risks are exacerbated for projects with longterm durations because there is an increased risk that the circumstances on which we based our original estimates will change in a manner that increases costs if the project is significant or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our contracts that are fundamentally cost reimbursable in nature may also present a risk to the extent the final cost on a project exceeds the amount the customer expected or budgeted like fixedprice contracts the expected cost of costreimbursable projects are based in part on our estimates of the resources and time necessary to perform such contracts if we are unable to properly support the costs we incur or otherwise fail to obtain proper reimbursement for all costs incurred  for whatever reason  the project may be less profitable than we expect or even result in losses additionally we may be required to pay liquidated damages if we fail to meet schedule or performance requirements of our contracts which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operation 

our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel  

the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel including engineers architects designers craft personnel and corporate management professionals at a reasonable cost who have the required experience and expertise the market for these and other personnel is competitive from time to time it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients or to replace such personnel when needed in a timely manner in certain geographic areas for example we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel in addition some of our personnel hold government granted clearance that may be required to obtain government projects if we were to lose some or all of these personnel they would be difficult to replace 

in addition in the event that any of our key personnel retire or otherwise leave the company we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans which requires devoting time and resources toward identifying and integrating new personnel into leadership roles and other key positions if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the cost of providing our services including the extent to which we utilize our workforce affects our profitability for example the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts if an expected contract award is delayed or not received we could incur costs resulting from excess staff reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business financial conditions and results of operations 

page 23 

the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted cancelled or suspended by our clients and therefore our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings additionally even if fully performed our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins 

as of the end of fiscal 2015  our backlog totaled approximately 188 billion  there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or if realized will result in profits in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation termination or suspension at the discretion of the client in the event of a project cancellation we would generally have no contractual right to the total revenue reflected in our backlog projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns 

the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts the revenue for certain contracts included in backlog are based on estimates additionally the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence future profitability 

in some markets there is a continuing trend towards costreimbursable contracts with incentivefee arrangements typically our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs overall safety performance overall client satisfaction and other performance criteria if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards we may receive a lower or even zero incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins accordingly there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog assuming they produce the revenues currently expected will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies which are a significant source of our revenue and profit are subject to various uncertainties restrictions and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities as well as profit and cost controls which could result in withholding or delay of payments to us government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding such as sequestration and budget deficits contracts with the us federal government for example are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for government programs may even be eliminated 

as a result our government clients may reduce the scope or terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues for example those with the us federal government represented approximately 217  of our total revenue in fiscal 2015  a significant reduction in government funding or the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

most government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process the us federal government has increasingly relied upon multipleyear contracts with multiple contractors that generally require those contractors to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under a contract this process may result in us facing significant additional pricing pressure and uncertainty and incurring additional costs moreover we may not be awarded government contracts because of existing policies designed to protect small businesses and underrepresented minorities our inability to win new contracts or be awarded work under existing contracts could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 

in addition government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socioeconomic requirements which affects how we transact business with our clients and in some instances impose additional costs on our business operations for example for contracts with the us federal government we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation the truth in negotiations act the cost accounting standards the service contract act and numerous regulations governing environmental protection and employment practices government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than nongovernment contracts this includes for example unlimited indemnification obligations 

we also are subject to government audits investigations and proceedings for example government agencies such as the us defense contract audit agency routinely review and audit us to determine the adequacy of and our compliance with 

page 24 

our internal control systems and policies and whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations these audits can result in a determination that a rule or regulation has been violated or that adjustments are necessary to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies 

if we violate a rule or regulation fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit a variety of penalties can be imposed including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties in addition any or all of our government contracts could be terminated we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work or payment of our costs could be disallowed for example in socalled qui tam actions brought by individuals or the government under the us federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws treble damages can be awarded the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances which can be difficult and time consuming to obtain if our employees are unable to obtain or retain the necessary securities clearances our clients could terminate or not renew existing contracts or award us new contracts to the extent this occurs our operations and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control 

as is common in the industry we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures partnerships and similar arrangements this situation exposes us to a number of risks including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients we cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners including the nonperformance default or bankruptcy of our joint venture partners our partners may be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships if these circumstances occur we may be required to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages provide additional services or make additional investments to ensure adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services under agreements with joint and several liabilities we could be liable for both our obligations and those of our partners these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations we depend on the management effectiveness of our joint venture partners differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major issues which could materially affect the business and operations of these ventures 

we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner in these cases we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the failure by a joint venture partner to comply with applicable laws regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and for government clients could result in fines penalties suspension or even debarment being imposed on us which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts 

much of the work performed under our contracts is performed by thirdparty subcontractors we hire we also rely on thirdparty equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired if we are not able to locate qualified thirdparty subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated especially in a lumpsum or a fixedprice contract we may suffer losses on these contracts if a subcontractor supplier or manufacturer fails to provide services supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason we may be required to source these services equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms which could impact contract profitability there is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors relating to among other things the quality and timeliness of work performed customer concerns about the subcontractor or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a contract in addition faulty workmanship equipment or materials could impact the overall project resulting in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications 

page 25 

in the current economic environment third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party’s ability to provide materials equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a failure by a third party subcontractor supplier or manufacturer to comply with applicable laws regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and for government clients could result in fines penalties suspension or even debarment being imposed on us which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

negative conditions in the credit and financial markets and delays in receiving client payments could result in liquidity problems adversely affecting our cost of borrowing or our business 

although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions in addition some of our clients depend on the availability of credit to help finance their capital projects instability in the credit markets in the us or abroad could cause the availability of credit to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain at competitive rates on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts this situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds refinance our existing indebtedness enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us we may also enter into business acquisition agreements that require us to access credit which if not available at the closing of the acquisition could result in a breach of the acquisition agreement and a resulting claim for damages by the sellers of such business in addition market conditions could negatively impact our clients’ ability to fund their projects and therefore utilize our services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors suppliers and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements on less favorable terms with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are therefore subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices in weak economic environments we may experience increased delays and failures due to among other reasons our clients’ unwillingness to pay for alleged poor performance or to preserve their own working capital if one or more clients delays in paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

furthermore our cash balances and shortterm investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america europe south america australia and asia some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership or have been seized by their governments there is a risk that such events may occur in the future if any such events were to occur we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund our operations which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

maintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts 

in line with industry practice we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds or letters of credit to our customers these instruments indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract if a bond or a letter of credit is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond or letter of credit we cannot pursue that project historically we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity but as is typically the case the issuance of a bond is at the surety’s sole discretion and the issuance of a letter of credit is based on the companys credit worthiness because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms in addition future projects may require us to obtain letters of credit that extend beyond the term of our existing credit facilities our inability to obtain 

page 26 

adequate bonding and as a result to bid on new contracts that require such bonding or letter of credit could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

past and future environmental heath and safety laws could impose significant additional costs and liabilities 

we are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities 

various us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants the liability under these laws is joint and several we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen cleanup obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

when we perform our services our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions we may be subject to liability claims by employees customers and third parties as a result of such exposures in addition we may be subject to fines penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws a claim if not covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

such laws regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could for example relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and in turn could negatively impact our revenue changes in the environmental laws and regulations remediation obligations enforcement actions stricter interpretations of existing requirements future discovery of contamination or claims for damages to persons property natural resources or the environment could result in material costs and liabilities that we currently do not anticipate if we fail to comply with such laws or regulations whether actual or alleged we could be exposed to fines penalties or potential litigation liabilities including costs settlements and judgments any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments which may require us or our clients to obtain and to comply with federal state and local government permits and approvals any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial revocation or modification under various circumstances failure to obtain or comply with or the loss or modification of the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and result of operations 

if we fail to comply with federal state local or foreign governmental requirements our business may be adversely affected 

we are subject to us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business for example our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders although we have policies and procedures to comply with us and foreign international trade laws the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges privileges or debarment from participation in us government contracts and could damage our reputation and our ability to do business 

employee agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts which could result in reduced revenues and profits 

misconduct fraud noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or other improper activities by one of our employees agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations regulations regarding the protection of classified information regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts regulations on lobbying or similar activities regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting regulations pertaining to export control environmental laws and any other applicable laws or regulations for example we routinely provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters if a 

page 27 

security breach were to occur our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective and we could face unknown risks or losses our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties cancellation of contracts loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act of 2010 and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices despite our training and compliance programs there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions including contract cancellations or debarment and loss of reputation any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the loss of or a significant reduction in business from one or a few customers could have an adverse impact on us 

a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue andor backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years for example in fiscal 2015  2014  and fiscal 2013  approximately 217  178  and 199  respectively of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government although we have longstanding relationships with many of our significant clients our clients may unilaterally reduce delay or cancel their contracts at any time our loss of or a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in risk factors our international operations are also exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies 

for fiscal 2015  approximately 409  of our revenues was earned from clients outside the us our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues our international operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

 page 28 

 the lack of a welldeveloped legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights in addition military action or continued unrest particularly in the middle east could impact the supply or pricing of oil disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic political and other conditions our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we work in international locations where there are high security risks which could result in harm to our employees or unanticipated cost 

some of our services are performed in high risk locations where the country or location is subject to political social or economic risks or war or civil unrest in those locations where we have employees or operations we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel despite these activities in these locations we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel and we may suffer future losses of employees and subcontractors 

foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects 

our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects both positive and negative that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar into the us dollar while we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in the currencies of our expenditures we do enter into contracts that expose us to currency risk particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs we attempt to minimize our exposure from currency risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies or entering into derivative hedging instruments when there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts these actions however may not always eliminate currency risk exposure based on fluctuations in currency the us dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly we may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries 

our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties 

our business strategy involves growth through among other things the acquisition of other companies acquiring companies presents a number of risks including 

 page 29 

while we often obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses such rights may be difficult to enforce the losses may exceed any dedicated escrow funds and the indemnitors may not have the ability to financially support the indemnity 

if our management is unable to successfully integrate acquired companies or implement our growth strategy our operating results could be harmed in addition even if the operations of an acquisition are integrated successfully we may not realize the full benefits of an acquisition including the synergies cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all moreover we cannot assure that we will continue to successfully expand or that growth or expansion will result in profitability 

in addition there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us existing cash balances and cash flow from operations together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities may be insufficient to make acquisitions credit market conditions may also make it more difficult and costly to finance acquisitions acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 

in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make we could dilute share ownership 

one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities if we issue additional equity securities such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders’ individual ownership percentages in the company 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock fluctuations are caused by a number of factors including 

 our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements 

in preparing our financial statements our management is required under us gaap to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities areas requiring significant estimates by our management include 

 page 30 

 our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

an impairment charge of goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

because we have grown in part through acquisitions goodwill and intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets under us gaap we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach as of october 2 2015  we had 30 billion  of goodwill representing 392  of our total assets of 78 billion  we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business potential government actions toward our facilities and other factors 

if our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value we could be required to record an impairment charge the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing please see item 7— management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  below 

we may be required to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and postretirement benefit plans we manage 

we have various employee benefit plan obligations that require us to make contributions to satisfy over time our underfunded benefit obligations which are generally determined by calculating the projected benefit obligations minus the fair value of plan assets for example as of october 2 2015  and september 26 2014  our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans were projected to be underfunded by 4131 million  and 4008 million  respectively see note 6— pension plans  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k for additional disclosure in the future our benefit plan obligations may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of interest rates pension plan asset performance and other factors if we are required to contribute a significant amount of the deficit for underfunded benefit plans our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

rising inflation interest rates andor construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts in particular with respect to our fixedprice contracts 

rising inflation interest rates or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services in addition we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixedprice because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from costreimbursable type contracts approximately 830  during fiscal 2015  the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor however if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixedprice and lumpsum work is more prevalent inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future therefore increases in inflation interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

page 31 

we may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change 

growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations for example there is a growing consensus that new and additional regulations may be enacted concerning among other things greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased compliance costs for us and our clients legislation international protocols regulation or other restrictions on emissions could also affect our clients including those who are involved in the exploration production or refining of fossil fuels emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels or emit greenhouse gases through the mining manufacture utilization or production of materials or goods such policy changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or in some cases prevent a project from going forward thereby potentially reducing the need for our services which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations however these changes could also increase the pace of projects such as carbon capture or storage projects that could have a positive impact on our business we cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers 

our effective tax rate may increase or decrease 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation the introduction of new tax accounting standards legislation regulations and related interpretations our global mix of earnings the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

systems and information technology interruption or failure and data security breaches could adversely impact our ability to operate or expose us to significant financial losses and reputational harm 

we rely heavily on computer information and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business from time to time we experience occasional system interruptions and delays in the event we are unable to regularly deploy software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems the operation of such systems could be interrupted or result in the loss corruption or release of data in addition our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters force majeure events telecommunications failures power loss acts of war or terrorism computer viruses malicious code physical or electronic security breaches intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error or similar events or disruptions any of these or other events could cause interruptions delays loss of critical andor sensitive data or similar effects which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition protection of intellectual property and results of operations as well as those of our clients 

in addition we face the threat to our computer systems of unauthorized access computer hackers computer viruses malicious code organized cyberattacks and other security problems and system disruptions including possible unauthorized access to and disclosure of our and our clients’ proprietary or classified information we rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain all confidential and proprietary information on our computer systems but they may still be vulnerable to these threats as a result we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these system disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these disruptions and breaches any of these events could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or that of our clients 

our technology and intellectual property provide us in many instances with a competitive advantage although we protect our property through patent registrations license restrictions and similar mechanisms we may not be able to successfully preserve our rights and they could be invalidated circumvented challenged or become obsolete in addition the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the us if we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights even if ultimately successful could be costly and could divert management’s attention away from other aspects of our business 

page 32 

in addition if our intellectual property rights or work processes become obsolete we may not be able to differentiate our service offerings and some of our competitors may be able to offer more attractive services to our customers our competitors may independently attempt to develop or obtain access to technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies 

our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property there is a risk we may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and as a result could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities loss of contracts or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control 

extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control such as natural or manmade disasters could negatively impact our ability to operate as an example from time to time we face unexpected severe weather conditions which may result in weatherrelated delays that are not always reimbursable under a fixedprice contract evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services increased labor and material costs in areas resulting from weatherrelated damage and subsequent increased demand for labor and materials for repairing and rebuilding inability to deliver materials equipment and personnel to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules and loss of productivity we may remain obligated to perform our services after any such natural or manmade event unless a force majeure clause or other contractual provision provides us with relief from our contractual obligations if we are not able to react quickly to such events or if a high concentration of our projects are in a specific geographic region that suffers from a natural or manmade catastrophe our operations may be significantly affected which could have a negative impact on our operations in addition if we cannot complete our contracts on time we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients which may reduce our profits 

we are subject to professional standards duties and statutory obligations on professional reports and opinions we issue which could subject us to monetary damages 

we issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional engineering expertise as well as our other professional credentials that subject us to professional standards duties and obligations regulating the performance of our services for example we issue opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings if a client or another third party alleges that our report or opinion is incorrect or it is improperly relied upon and we are held responsible we could be subject to significant monetary damages in addition our reports and other work product may need to comply with professional standards licensing requirements securities regulations and other laws and rules governing the performance of professional services in the jurisdiction where the services are performed we could be liable to third parties who use or rely upon our reports and other work product even if we are not contractually bound to those third parties these events could in turn result in monetary damages and penalties 

delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control 

we are a delaware corporation certain antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us in addition certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover for example 

 these types of provisions as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders accordingly stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend critical accounting policies 

in order to understand better the changes that occur to key elements of our financial condition results of operations and cash flows a reader of this management’s discussion and analysis “mda” should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business performing longterm engineering and constructiontype contracts requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect both the entity’s results of operations and the carrying values of its assets and liabilities although our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 – significant accounting policies  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k the following discussion is intended to highlight and describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue accounting for contracts and use of joint ventures —in general we recognize revenues at the time we provide services depending on the commercial terms of the contract we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred or using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion this method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress as of the balance sheet dates in making such estimates judgments are required to evaluate the possible effects of variances in schedule the costs of materials and labor productivity and the impact of change orders claims contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee for contracts containing incentive fee arrangements fees are frequently based on achievement of target completion dates target costs andor other performance criteria failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or nonrecoverable costs which could exceed revenues recognized from the project 

we provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known without regard to the percentage of completion for multiple contracts with a single customer we account for each contract separately 

the nature of our business sometimes results in clients subcontractors or vendors presenting claims to us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible in those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract we include in the total estimated costs of the contract and therefore the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract an estimate based on all relevant facts and circumstances available of the additional costs to be incurred similarly and in the normal course of business we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible in those situations where we have presented such claims to our clients we include in revenues the amount of costs incurred without profit to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims 

certain costreimbursable contracts with government customers as well as many commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment in this situation revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts in those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs that are not allowable under the terms of the contract we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly 

as is common to the industry we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures and consortiums although the joint ventures own and hold the contracts with the clients the services required by the contracts are typically performed by us and our joint venture partners or by other subcontractors under subcontracting agreements with the joint ventures the assets of our joint ventures therefore consist almost entirely of cash and receivables representing amounts due from clients and the liabilities of our joint ventures consist almost entirely of amounts due to the joint venture partners for services provided by the partners to the joint ventures under their individual subcontracts and other subcontractors in general at any given time the equity of our joint ventures represents the undistributed profits earned on contracts the joint ventures hold with clients very few of our joint ventures have employees none of our joint ventures have 

page 39 

thirdparty debt or credit facilities our joint ventures therefore are simply mechanisms used to deliver engineering and construction services to clients rarely do they in and of themselves present any risk of loss to us or to our partners separate from those that we would carry if we were performing the contract on our own under us gaap our share of losses associated with the contracts held by the joint ventures if and when they occur has always been reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

in evaluating the companys joint ventures also referred to as variable interest entities or vies for accounting and consolidation purposes we perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether or not the company has a “controlling financial interest” in the vie the company is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a vie if it has i the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and ii the right to receive benefits or obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie in making our qualitative analysis the company assesses each vie to determine those activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and whether the company another entity or multiple entities have the power to direct those activities 

  if we determine that we have the power to direct those activities of the vie that most significantly impact its financial performance and have the right or obligation to receive benefits or absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie then we are the primary beneficiary of the vie and we consolidate the vie if we determine that we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the vie or power is shared by two or more unrelated parties then we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not consolidate the vie 

for the companys unconsolidated joint ventures we use either the equity method of accounting or proportional consolidation the company does not currently participate in any significant vies in which it has a controlling financial interest there were no changes in facts and circumstances in the period that caused the company to reassess the method of accounting for its vies 

accounting for stock issued to employees and others — we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the estimated grantdate fair value of the award we estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors using the blackscholes optionpricing model like all optionpricing models the blackscholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions including i the expected volatility of the market price of the underlying stock and ii the expected term of the award among others accordingly changes in assumptions and any subsequent adjustments to those assumptions can cause drastically different fair values to be assigned to our stock option awards for restricted stock units containing service and performance conditions with measures external to the company compensation expense is based on the fair value of such units determined using monte carlo simulations due to the uncertainties inherent in the use of assumptions and the results of applying monte carlo simulations the amount of expense recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the effects on our future consolidated financial statements because equity awards tend to vest over several years and additional equity awards may be made in the future 

accounting for pension plans — the accounting for pension plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans’ assets and liabilities these assumptions include discount rates investment returns and projected salary increases among others the actuarial assumptions used in determining the funded statuses of the plans are provided in note 6 – pension plans  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

the expected rates of return on plan assets for fiscal 2016 range from 35 to 85 compared to 45 to 85 for the prior year we believe the range of rates selected for fiscal 2016 reflects the longterm returns expected on the plans’ assets considering recent market conditions projected rates of inflation the diversification of the plans’ assets and the expected real rates of market returns the discount rates used to compute plan liabilities were changed from a range of 18 to 88 in fiscal 2014 to a range of 16 to 78 in fiscal 2015 these assumptions represent the company’s best estimate of the rates at which its pension obligations could be effectively settled 

changes in the actuarial assumptions often have a material effect on the values assigned to plan assets and liabilities and the associated pension expense for example if the discount rate used to value the net pension benefit obligation “pbo” at october 2 2015  was higher lower by 05 the pbo would have been lower higher at that date by approximately 1021 million for nonus plans and by approximately 258 million for us plans if the expected return on plan assets was higher lower by 10 the net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2016 would be lower higher by approximately 90 million for nonus plans and by approximately 36 million for us plans differences between actuarial assumptions and actual performance ie actuarial gains and losses that are not recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost in the period in which such differences 

page 40 

arise are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are recognized as part of net periodic pension cost in future periods in accordance with us gaap management monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in an effort to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used 

  

contractual guarantees litigation investigations and insurance — in the normal course of business we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation the guarantees to which we are a party generally relate to project schedules and plant performance most of the litigation in which we are involved has us as a defendant in workers’ compensation personal injury environmental employmentlabor professional liability and other similar lawsuits we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations we have elected however to retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under our insurance programs this situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured and we intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of our contracts 

in accordance with us gaap we record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such guarantees litigation and insurance claims we include any adjustments to such liabilities in our consolidated results of operations 

in addition as a contractor providing services to the us federal government and several of its agencies we are subject to many levels of audits investigations and claims by or on behalf of the us federal government with respect to contract performance pricing costs cost allocations and procurement practices we adjust revenues based upon the amounts we expect to realize considering the effects of any client audits or governmental investigations 

testing goodwill for possible impairment — the goodwill carried on our consolidated balance sheets is tested annually for possible impairment in performing the annual impairment test we evaluate our goodwill at the reporting unit level for fiscal 2015 and consistent with prior years we determined that we have two reporting units which are based on geography we refer to these reporting units internally as “europe” and “noneurope” each of our reporting units conducts the business activities described elsewhere in this 2015  form 10k which includes providing professional technical services such as design engineering and architectural services construction andor construction management services and operations and maintenance services 

our geographybased reporting units reflect the company’s organizational structure which is based predominately on geography as well as our acquisition strategy which favors acquisition targets that among other things provide access to new geographic areas our reporting units represent rational groupings into which substantially all of our major acquisitions which are responsible for the goodwill appearing in our consolidated balance sheets have been assimilated and where all of the operations under each reporting unit share in the benefits of the goodwill created by our acquisitions 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 we announced a reorganization of our operations around four global lines of business this reorganization is intended to better serve our global clients leverage our workforce help streamline operations and provide enhanced growth opportunities the four global lines of business are petroleum  chemicals buildings  infrastructure aerospace  technology and industrial each business unit has a president that reports directly to the companys president  ceo as part of the reorganization certain support functions ie sales which have been managed centrally for many years will be embedded in the new business units and will report to the respective line of business presidents the costs of other support functions eg accounting legal human resources and information technology and certain other activities eg global insurance will either be assigned or allocated to each new business unit using a rationale method of assignment  allocation or will remain an element of corporate general and administrative expenses in addition the company has significantly modified its major cash incentive plan utilizing forecasted performance metrics aligned along the new lines of business we are in the process of modifying our systems and work processes to report the results of these business units accurately and timely we are also developing processes for accurately eliminating interunit revenue and profit we expect to complete our system and other process changes so that we may accurately report operating results by line of business to the companys president  ceo no later than the second quarter of fiscal 2016 

us gaap does not prescribe a specific valuation method for estimating the fair value of reporting units the valuation technique used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including revenue growth rates operating margins discount rates and future market conditions among others 

for fiscal years 2014  through 2015  we used both an income approach and a market approach to test our goodwill for possible impairment such approaches require us to make estimates and judgments under the income approach fair value is 

page 41 

determined by using the discounted cash flows of our reporting units under the market approach the fair value of our reporting units is determined by reference to guideline companies that are reasonably comparable to our reporting units the fair values are estimated based on the valuation multiples of the invested capital associated with the guideline companies in assessing whether there is an indication that the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired we utilize the results of both valuation techniques and consider the range of fair values indicated the fair values for each reporting unit exceeded the respective book values by over 20  to 40  the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units in our testing were 

income approach 

with respect to the income approach we utilized internal financial projections through fiscal 2018 for the fiscal 2014 impairment analysis and fiscal 2019 for the fiscal 2015 impairment analysis we assumed a weighted average cost of capital of 1100 for the fiscal 2014 impairment analysis and 1125 for the fiscal 2015 impairment analysis we also assumed a residual period growth rate of 300 for both the fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 impairment analyses 

market approach 

with respect to the market approach for guideline publicly traded companies reasonably comparable to the companys reporting units the company used multiples ranging from 59 to 76 of ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and 76 to 100 of ebit earnings before interest and taxes for the fiscal year 2014  test applied to the projected fiscal year 2014  to 2016 financial results for each of our reporting units the company used multiples ranging from 63 to 64 of ebitda and 74 to 75 of ebit for the fiscal year 2015  test applied to the projected fiscal year 2015  to 2017 financial results for each of our reporting units 

it is possible that changes in market conditions economy facts and circumstances judgments and assumptions used in estimating the fair value could change resulting in possible impairment of goodwill in the future the fair values resulting from the valuation techniques used are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of the reporting units to willing third parties 

the company performs the annual goodwill impairment test for the reporting units at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year the company will test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount we have determined that the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values for fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  

based on the most recent results of our annual impairment tests there were no indications of impairment of the goodwill shown in our consolidated balance sheets at either october 2 2015  or september 26 2014  furthermore the company performed an interim impairment assessment at october 2 2015  and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of either reporting unit had been reduced to an amount below its carrying amount

fiscal 2015 — overview 

fiscal year 

the company’s fiscal year ends on the friday closest to september 30 determined on the basis of the number of workdays and accordingly an additional week of activity is added every five to six  years fiscal 2015 results of operations includes an additional week of operations as compared to fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 which was not material to the companys fiscal 2015 consolidated results of operations 

the 2015 restructuring 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2015  the company commenced a series of initiatives intended to improve operational efficiency reduce costs and better position itself to drive growth of the business in the future the  2015  restructuring actions related to the 2015  restructuring completed during the fiscal year include involuntary terminations the abandonment of certain leased offices combining operational organizations and the colocation of employees into other existing offices we are not exiting any service types or client endmarkets the companys consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2015  include a 1572 million  pretax impact relating to costs associated with the 2015  restructuring the costs of the 2015  restructuring are almost entirely included in selling general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings the company expects to largely complete the 2015  restructuring by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2016  the following table summarizes the effects of the 2015  restructuring on the companys consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2015  in thousands except for earnings per share 



the 2015  intercompany debt refinancing 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2015  the company completed the refinancing of certain international intercompany debt the 2015 intercompany debt refinancing the 2015  intercompany debt refinancing resulted in a onetime tax benefit of 231 million  or 018   per share 

the 2014  restructuring and other unusual events affecting fiscal 2014 

d uring the third quarter of fiscal 2014  the company initiated the  2014  restructuring in recognition of the slowdown in several of the companys clients end markets the company implemented a series of initiatives which much like the 2015  restructuring were intended to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs and also to accelerate the integration of skm 

in addition to the 2014  restructuring and the acquisition of skm the companys consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2014  were affected by the following discrete events 

 page 43 

 

as used herein the term  2014  events refers to the combined effects of both the 2014  restructuring and the unusual events described above within this mda the company may disclose and discuss its results of operations before the effects of the 2015  restructuring the 2014  events andor certain other transactions and events described herein although such information is nongaap in nature it is presented because management believes it provides a better view of the company’s operating results to investors to assess the company’s performance and operating trends as used herein the terms adjusted earnings and adjusted net earnings refer to the companys gaap earnings as adjusted to eliminate the effects of the 2014  events when used in reference to fiscal 2014  results of operations and the 2015  restructuring when used in reference to fiscal 2015  results of operations 

2015 overview 

the companys gaap net earnings for fiscal 2015   decreased  by 251 million  or 76  compared to fiscal 2014  included in net earnings for fiscal 2015  is the 2015  intercompany debt refinancing included in our fiscal year 2015  results was a 121 million  negative impact related to the strengthening us dollar excluding the effects of the 2015  restructuring and the 2014  restructuring the companys adjusted net earnings for fiscal 2015 decreased  by 264 million  or 60  compared to the prior year 

the effects of lower prices of crude oil and certain commodities including copper and iron ore continue to present headwinds for clients operating in the refiningdownstream oil  gasupstream and mining and minerals industries and markets our infrastructure and national government programs groups continue to perform well actions taken pursuant to the 2015 restructuring have begun to lower the companys overall cost structure which is helping to offset the negative pressures we are experiencing in certain of our markets 

the companys results for fiscal 2015  when compared to the prior year were positively impacted by i the skm acquisition which is included for all of fiscal 2015  compared to only approximately 912 months in fiscal 2014 and to a lesser degree ii the other acquisitions completed during fiscal 2014  described below also influencing the comparability of the companys fiscal 2015  results of operations to fiscal 2014  were the 2015  restructuring and the 2014  events 

the following table summarizes the effects of the 2014  events on the companys consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2014  in thousands except for earnings per share 



backlog at october 2 2015  was 188 billion  and represents an increase of 23  over backlog at september 26 2014  backlog remains near record levels despite the negative effects on backlog stemming from foreign exchange new prospects and new sales remain strong and the company continues to have a positive outlook for many of the industry groups and markets in which our clients operate

during fiscal 2015  the company repurchased and retired 97 million  shares of its common stock under its share repurchase program total cash spent for the shares repurchased during fiscal 2015 was 4223 million  as of october 2 2015  the company exhausted the 500 million approved by the board of directors on august 19 2014 on july 23 2015 the board of directors approved a program to purchase an additional 500 million of the companys common stock over the next three years 

business combinations completed during fiscal 2014 

in december 2013 the company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in skm the acquisition of skm is described in more detail under notes to consolidated financial statements below as well as on page 7 and beginning on page f11 of our annual report on form 10k 

we also completed a number of other acquisitions during fiscal 2014  including federal network systems llc fns formerly a subsidiary of verizon eagleton engineering llc fmhc corporation stobbarts nuclear limited trompeter enterprises and marmac field services inc the results of operations of these other acquisitions were not material individually or in the aggregate to the companys consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2014  during fiscal 2014  we also acquired an additional 15 interest in jacobs zamel and turbag consulting engineers company zate this transaction brought the companys ownership in zate to 75 

consistent with other business combinations we have completed in the past we began integrating skm and the other businesses we acquired last year into our existing operations almost immediately after each business was acquired accordingly it is not practicable to provide complete financial information for fiscal 2015  on a standalone basis for any of the businesses we acquired last year 

results of operations 

general 

our business focuses exclusively on providing technical professional services and field services to a large number of industrial commercial and governmental clients around the world the services we provide generally fall into four broad categories 

 the scope of services we can provide our clients therefore ranges from consulting and conceptual design services which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project to complete singleresponsibility designbuild contracts to services required in the post startup phases of a project such as om services 

page 45 

the following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each of the last three fiscal years in thousands 

  

project services revenues for the year ended october 2 2015   decreased   2690 million  or 41  from the corresponding period last year the decrease  in project services revenues was due primarily to the lower business volumes in the refining  downstream and chemicals and polymers markets particularly in north american and uk driven principally by the decline in oil and other commodity prices combined with the effects of the strengthening us dollar 

process scientific and systems consulting revenues for the year ended october 2 2015   increased   4295 million  or 566  from the corresponding period last year the increase  was due primarily to the fns acquisition completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 the revenues in this service type relate to science engineering and technical support services provided primarily to the us federal government clients and its various agencies 

construction revenues for the year ended october 2 2015   decreased   8469 million  or 205  from the corresponding period last year the decrease  was primarily due to the winding down of a us project in the mining and minerals market combined with lower business volume in the refining  downstream line of business 

operations and maintenance revenues for the year ended october 2 2015   increased   1061 million  or 87  from the corresponding period last year the increase  was primarily due to higher volume in the chemicals and polymers and refiningdownstream markets partially offset by a decline in national government programs 

we focus our services on clients operating in select industry groups and markets we believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit crossutilization of our resources the following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each of the last three fiscal years in thousands 

  

revenues decreased   5803 million  or 46  from 127 billion  for fiscal 2014  to 121 billion  for fiscal 2015  revenues for fiscal year 2015  include a negative impact of 5610 million  related to the strengthening us dollar 

page 46 

revenues from clients operating in the national government programs market increased   3616 million  or 158  to 26 billion  from 23 billion  for the corresponding period last year the increase  was due primarily to the fns acquisition completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 

revenues from projects for clients operating in the chemicals and polymers industries decreased   6046 million  or 203  to 24 billion  from 30 billion  for the corresponding period last year the decrease  in revenues was due primarily to the normal windingdown and completion of certain projects in the us the uk and europe although we continue to receive new awards for feed frontend engineering design and prefeed services larger integrated oil companies continue to reevaluate their investment opportunities considering current oil prices we have longterm relationships with numerous chemical companies around the world and we believe this industry group will provide growth opportunities in the longterm the acquisition of skm strengthened our capabilities for customers operating in this market as evidenced by a significant professional services contract we were awarded for what will be the largest chlorine dioxide plant in the world located in asia 

revenues from clients operating in the refining  downstream market decreased   2836 million  or 127  to 20 billion  from 22 billion  for the corresponding period last year the decrease  occurred within our operations in canada europe and the uk 

revenues from clients operating in the infrastructure market increased   2643 million  or 194  from 14 billion  for fiscal 2014  to 16 billion  for fiscal 2015  the increase  was due primarily to increased activity in the uk the us and australia we believe market conditions may continue to improve within this industry group particularly for transportation water and certain other projects around the globe although there is higher uncertainty in us federal funding for certain highway projects one example is the asset management programme amp6 cycle in the uk where we provide a full range of professional services including regulatory strategic consultancy engineering project support and asset maintenance 

revenues on projects for clients operating in the oil  gasupstream market increased   559 million  or 65  to 9192 million  from 8633 million  for the corresponding period last year the increase was due primarily to higher business volume in the us and the middle east partially offset by a decrease in canada the company believes that the recent decline in crude oil prices has dampened our clients nearterm capital spending plans as a result we expect certain clients to begin deploying more of their capital budgets to sustaining capitaltype programs smallcap projects and maintenancedriven work an area where the company is strong 

revenues from clients operating in the buildings market increased   669 million  or 80  from 8341 million  for fiscal 2014  to  9010 million  for fiscal 2015  we saw growth globally with health care higher education mission critical and certain other technically complex buildings and facilities supported by the acquisition of skm we view the buildings market as improving as our business in this industry group continues to shift towards projects for clients in the private sector 

revenues from clients operating in the mining and minerals markets decreased   4617 million  or 503  from 9186 million  for fiscal 2014  to 4569 million  for fiscal 2015  the decrease  was due to the winding down of several projects in north and south america and australia without significant new work being added globally continuing pressure on commodity prices have caused our clients in these industries to behave more conservatively when it comes to new spend it is possible that this situation may continue for the foreseeable future accordingly the company is refocusing and reallocating its resources onto brownfield and sustaining capitaltype projects longerterm we believe we are well positioned to realize incremental business when the current pricing environment improves 

direct costs of contracts decreased   4749 million  or 45  from 1062 billion  during fiscal 2014  to 1015 billion  during fiscal 2015  direct costs of contracts include all costs incurred in connection with and directly for the benefit of client contracts including depreciation and amortization relating to assets used in connection with providing the services required by client projects the level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors including the amount of passthrough costs we incur during a period on those projects where we are responsible for subcontract labor or thirdparty materials and equipment we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs and we refer to such costs as “passthrough costs” on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not considered passthrough costs and are therefore not reflected in either revenues or costs to the extent that we incur a significant amount of passthrough costs in a period our direct cost of contracts are likely to increase as well 

passthrough costs decreased   3522 million  or 119  from 295 billion  during fiscal 2014  to 260 billion  for fiscal 2015  in general passthrough costs are more significant on projects that have a higher content of field services activities pass 

page 47 

through costs are generally incurred at a specific point in the lifecycle of a project and are highly dependent on the needs of our individual clients and the nature of the clients’ projects however because we have hundreds of projects which start at various times within a fiscal year the effect of passthrough costs on the level of direct costs of contracts can vary between fiscal years without there being a fundamental or significant change to the underlying business 

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts were 838  for fiscal 2015  compared to 837  for fiscal 2014  the relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided generally speaking the more procurement we do on behalf of our clients ie where we purchase equipment and materials for use on projects andor procure subcontracts in connection with projects and the more field services revenues we have relative to technical professional services revenues the higher the ratio will be of direct costs of contracts to revenues because revenues from passthrough costs typically have lower margin rates associated with them it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in such revenues without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit the ratio of direct costs of contracts to revenues was flat over the prior year period 

selling general and administrative sga expenses for fiscal 2015   decreased  by 229 million  or 15  to 152 billion  compared to 155 billion  for fiscal 2014  the decrease  in sga expenses was primarily due to lower costs stemming from the 2014  events which were partially offset by increased costs related to the 2015  restructuring excluding the effects of the 2015  restructuring and the 2014  events adjusted sga expenses for fiscal 2015   decreased   674 million  or 47  to 137 billion   from 144 billion  for the corresponding period last year 

net interest expense for fiscal 2015   increased   105 million  to 122 million  from 17 million  in fiscal 2014  included in net interest expense for fiscal 2014  was the reversal of 41 million  of accrued interest expense recorded in connection with income tax liabilities relating to certain contested international tax matters which were favorably resolved during the first quarter of fiscal 2014 adjusting for this reversal of expense net interest expense for fiscal 2014 was 59 million  

the companys effective income tax rate for fiscal 2015   declined  to 235  from 351  in fiscal 2014  the decrease was primarily the result of the 231 million  or 018  per share tax benefit related to the 2015  intercompany debt refinancing discussed earlier also contributing to the decrease in the tax rate when compared to prior year were the benefits realized by other individually insignificant discrete and nondiscrete items realized in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2015  

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 

the company’s net earnings decreased 950 million or 225 from 4231 million for fiscal 2013 to 3281 million for fiscal 2014 in addition to the effects of the 2014 restructuring and the acquisition of skm the companys consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2014 were affected by the other 2014 events described above 

revenues increased 8768 million or 74 from 118 billion for fiscal 2013 to 127 billion for fiscal 2014 

revenues from clients operating in the chemicals and polymers industries increased 5942 million or 249 from 24 billion for fiscal 2013 to 30 billion for fiscal 2014 this increase occurred throughout many of the geographic locations in which we operate we continued to receive new awards for feed frontend engineering design and prefeed services 

revenues from clients operating in the infrastructure market increased 3457 million or 340 from 10 billion for fiscal 2013 to 14 billion for fiscal 2014 skm contributed approximately 500 of the increase with the uk and us legacy operations contributing to the remainder of the increase 

revenues from clients operating in the buildings market increased 957 million or 130 from 7384 million for fiscal 2013 to 8341 million for fiscal 2014 although skm was responsible for most of this increase the company saw growth in our us and middle east markets 

revenues from clients operating in the mining and minerals markets increased 2063 million or 290 from 7123 million for fiscal 2013 to 9186 million for fiscal 2014 the increased revenues in 2014 was due primarily to skm globally our clients in these industries behaved relatively conservatively during fiscal 2014 when it cames to new spend 

page 48 

revenues from clients operating in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets decreased 708 million or 135 from 5235 million for fiscal 2013 to 4527 million for fiscal 2014 the decrease in revenues were due primarily to the normal winddown and completion of projects including work on several vaccine plants located in north america 

 revenues from clients operating in the industrial and other category decreased 1417 million or 158 from 8998 million for fiscal 2013 to 7580 million for fiscal 2014 the decrease in revenues was due primarily to decreased activity in the pulp  paper market in the us and the hightechnology manufacturing market in ireland 

direct costs of contracts increased 6453 million or 65 from 998 billion during fiscal 2013 to 1062 billion during fiscal 2014 passthrough costs increased 3300 million or 126 from 262 billion during fiscal 2013 to 295 billion for fiscal 2014 

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts were 837 for fiscal 2014 compared to 844 for fiscal 2013 the ratio of direct costs of contracts to revenues over the prior year period decreased primarily as a result of higher margins in both professional technical services and field services activities and the acquisition of skm 

sga expenses for fiscal 2014 increased by 3724 million or 317 to 155 billion compared to 117 billion for fiscal 2013 the increase in sga expenses reflects the effects of the 2014 restructuring discussed above as well as the results of operations of skm also included in sga expenses for the current fiscal year are transactionrelated expenses incurred in connection with the skm acquisition of 92 million also included in sga expenses for fiscal 2014 are due diligence and other transactionrelated costs incurred in connection with other mergers and acquisition activity 

net interest expense for fiscal 2014 decreased 58 million to 17 million from 75 million in fiscal 2013 the decrease is related to the reassessment during fiscal 2014 of a tax matter involving one of our international subsidiaries which resulted in the reversal of 81 million of accrued interest offset in part by the net impacts of the skm acquisition 

the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate was 351 for fiscal 2014 compared to 335 in fiscal 2013 contributing to the increase as compared to the prior year was the effect of the 2014 restructuring also contributing to the higher effective tax rate is the stamp duty paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 related to the skm acquisition 

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth certain information about our contractual obligations as of october 2 2015  in thousands 



  

 page 49 

 backlog 

backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us we include in backlog the entire value of contracts at the time the contracts are awarded to us or when we have otherwise been authorized by the client to proceed with the services required by the contracts with respect to om contracts however we include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for only one succeeding year regardless of the remaining life of the contract for national government programs other than us federal om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding option periods in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client in a situation where a client terminates a contract we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and in certain instances we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs in addition it is not unusual for clients to change the scope of services required by the contract over the life of the project accordingly backlog can fluctuate from one reporting period to the next due to the timing of when new contracts are added to backlog and when the contract revenue is recognized in our consolidated financial statements many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years 

please refer to item 1a— risk factors  above for a discussion of other factors that may cause backlog to ultimately convert into revenues at different amounts 

the following table summarizes our backlog for each of the last three fiscal years in millions 



our backlog at october 2 2015   increased  by 04 billion  or 23  to 188 billion  from 184 billion  at september 26 2014  the increase  in backlog from september 26 2014  to october 2 2015  was due primarily to new awards from clients operating in the chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries offset in part by an approximate 600 million reduction due to foreign exchange 

backlog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies totaled approximately 46 billion  or 246  of total backlog 44 billion  or 239  of total backlog and 39 billion  or 229  of total backlog at october 2 2015  september 26 2014  and september 27 2013  respectively most of our federal contracts require that services be provided beyond one year in general these contracts must be funded annually ie the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the us congress to the procuring agency and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts 

we estimate that approximately 73 billion  or 386  of total backlog at october 2 2015  will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year 

effects of inflation 

the effects of inflation on our business is discussed in item 1a— risk factors  and is incorporated herein by reference 

liquidity and capital resources 

at october 2 2015  our primary sources of liquidity consisted of 4609 million  of cash and cash equivalents and 10131 million  of available borrowing capacity under our 160 billion  revolving credit facility the 2014 facility 

page 50 

additional information regarding the 2014 facility is set forth in note 5  borrowings  in notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k we finance as much of our operations and growth as possible through cash generated by our operations 

during fiscal 2015  our cash and cash equivalents decreased  by 2718 million  from 7326 million  at september 26 2014  to 4609 million  at october 2 2015  this compares to a net decrease  in cash and cash equivalents of 5238 million  during the corresponding period last year during fiscal 2015  we experienced net cash inflows  of 4846 million  from operating activities offset by outflows  of 5533 million  from financing activities 961 million  from investing activities and 1069 million  from the effects of exchange rate changes 

operations provided  net cash of 4846 million  during fiscal 2015  this compares to net cash inflows  of 7217 million  and 4485 million  during fiscal 2014  and 2013  respectively the 2371 million   decrease  in cash provided by operations in fiscal 2015  as compared to fiscal 2014  was due primarily to a 2646 million   unfavorable  change in the companys working capital accounts and a 232 million   decrease  in net earnings attributable to the group partially offset by a 312 million  change related to the companys defined benefit pension plans 

because such a high percentage of our revenues are earned on costplus type contracts and due to the significance of revenues relating to passthrough costs most of the costs we incur are included in invoices we send to clients although we continually monitor our accounts receivable we manage the operating cash flows of the company by managing the working capital accounts in total rather than by the individual elements the primary elements of the company’s working capital accounts are accounts receivable accounts payable and billings in excess of cost accounts payable consists of obligations to third parties relating primarily to costs incurred for projects which are generally billable to clients accounts receivable consist of billings to our clients — a substantial portion of which is for projectrelated costs billings in excess of cost consist of billings to and payments from our clients for costs yet to be incurred 

this relationship between revenues and costs and between receivables and payables is unique to our industry and facilitates review of our liquidity at the total working capital level the changes in cash flows relating to our working capital accounts were due simply to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts and is not indicative of any known trend or fundamental change to the underlying business we still continue to experience delays in certain payments and have seen an increase in the length of payment terms with certain customers we believe that this situation does not present a significant risk to the companys cash flows we believe the risk of not collecting substantially all of the companys outstanding receivables is remote though the company provides services in a number of countries outside the us we believe our credit risk is not significant our private sector customers are comprised principally of large well known and well established multinational companies our government customers are comprised of national state and local agencies located principally in the us and the uk we have not historically experienced significant collection issues with either of our governmental or nongovernmental customers 

  

we used   961 million  of cash and cash equivalents for investing activities during fiscal 2015  this compares to 15 billion  and 1571 million  during fiscal 2014  and 2013  respectively this decrease  was primarily the result of minimal acquisition activity in fiscal 2015  as compared to the companys acquisition of skm for 12 billion 11 billion net of cash acquired in fiscal 2014  there was also minimal acquisition activity in fiscal 2013  

additions to property and equipment totaled 884 million  1321 million  and 1273 million  for fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively included in fiscal 2015  and 2014  activity are significant expenditures for leasehold improvements relating primarily to the consolidation of certain office space expansion of office space and relocations of certain office space all occurring in a number of locations 

our financing activities resulted in net cash outflows  of 5533 million  during fiscal 2015  as compared to net cash inflows  of 3049 million  and net cash outflows  of 597 million  during fiscal 2014  and 2013  respectively the 8582 million  in incremental cash outflows  during fiscal 2015  as compared to the previous year was due primarily to i a 5027 million  increase in cash used to payoff longterm debt during fiscal 2015  combined with ii 3439 million  used to repurchase shares of company common stock discussed in further detail in part ii item 5 of this annual report on form 10k substantially all of the amounts borrowed during fiscal 2014 under our 2014 facility was used to fund the companys business acquisitions completed last year 

    the company had 4609 million  of cash and short term equivalents at october 2 2015  of this amount approximately 999 million  was held in the us and 3610 million  was held outside of the us primarily in canada the uk and the eurozone other than the tax cost of repatriating funds held outside the us to the us see note 9— income 

page 51 

taxes  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k there are no impediments to repatriating these funds to the us 

the total amount utilized under the 2014 facility at october 2 2015  was 5869 million   5844 million  in the form of direct borrowings and 25 million  utilized in the form of letters of credit please refer to note 5— borrowings of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding the 2012 facility and the 2014 facility 

we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations support our acquisition strategy and service our debt for the next twelve months we had 4609 million  in cash and cash equivalents at october 2 2015  compared to 7326 million  at september 26 2014  our consolidated working capital position at october 2 2015  was 13 billion  a decrease  of 2404 million  from september 26 2014  

additionally there was 10 billion  of borrowing capacity available at october 2 2015  under the 2014 facility we believe that the remaining capacity terms and conditions of our revolving credit facility combined with cash onhand and the other committed and uncommitted facilities we have in place are adequate for our working capital and general business requirements 

the company had 2364 million  of letters of credit outstanding at october 2 2015  of this amount 25 million   were issued under the 2014 facility and 2339 million  were issued under separate committed and uncommitted letterofcredit facilities 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are party to financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk in the form of guarantees not reflected in our balance sheet that arise in the normal course of business however such offbalance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or resources that is material to investors see note 10 – commitments and contingencies and derivative financial instruments  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k

changes in internal control 

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the company’s fiscal quarter ended october 2 2015  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

page 54 

limitations on effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its system of internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed or operated can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of internal control are met the design of the company’s control system reflects the fact that there are resource constraints and that the benefits of such control system must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control failures and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the intentional acts of individuals by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that the design of any particular control will always succeed in achieving its objective under all potential future conditions

general background information 

we are one of the largest technical professional services firms in the world we provide a diverse range of technical professional and construction services to a large number of industrial commercial and governmental clients we provide four broad categories of services 

 we focus our services on clients operating in the following industries and markets 

 page 3 

we are headquartered in pasadena california usa and provide our services through more than 200 offices located around the globe primarily in north america south america europe the middle east india australia africa and asia 

how we operate 

the relationships we have with our clients drive our business as a broadbased technical professional services firm we offer a range of services to help our clients maintain a competitive edge in their respective markets from feasibility studies to design to engineering to construction to startup and commissioning and then to operations and maintenance we customize our services to meet business and project goals our global network of professionals works with a multioffice approach in an effort to provide clients with the best most economical project or program solutions 

we strive to provide client value through continuous improvement in our performance we regularly monitor our clients expectations our quality system and our operational performance tools such as our jacobs value enhancing practices global standard operating procedures project reviews the jacobs system to ensure project success jsteps and safe plans of action spas provide added value to our clients projects they also allow us to create performance improvement actions during the project execution through continuous improvement upon our performance our tools and our processes we believe we can offer our clients superior value when they do business with us 

jacobsvalue sm value plus is an internal tool we use to document and quantify the actual value or savings we provide to our clients and their projects some of the benefits achieved through the value plus program include lower total installed cost shorter schedule and reduced life cycle cost value plus is implemented at project initiation a project goal is created and costsaving ideas are entered into the value plus database when the value plus cycle is complete the project team and client identify unique cost andor schedule reductions for the project 

our business model 

our organizational structure and integrated system for delivering services are key components of our business strategy our operating units generally use a matrix organizational structure whereby our project management functions are supported by the various technical planning design and construction disciplines that are necessary to effectively execute longterm engineering and construction contracts we recognize that technical expertise alone cannot grow our business project management skills and the ability to manage multimillion dollar projects and programs for our clients are critical to our success crucial functions such as project controls and procurement are embedded within each of our major offices and serve operations by providing specialized services required by projects 

our business is set up to foster cooperation among teams and across our operating units we do not maintain “profit centers” within the company nor do the operating groups compete against each other for contracts our organizational structure and integrated system for delivering services are key components of our business strategy the following three ideas support our business model 

multidomestic approach 

we work in many countries with locally staffed offices that share a common set of values tools and a single vision while maintaining oneonone contact with individual clients this multidomestic approach enables us to provide customized service suited to the locale while still taking advantage of the company’s global network 

boundaryless approach 

our diversity encompasses our people geographic reach expertise and technical capabilities on projects around the world we enhance local expertise with the best talent and the best technology available anywhere throughout the company this seamless boundaryless approach keeps us flexible and enhances our ability to develop the best possible solutions for our clients regardless of office or project location 

cost management approach 

as the global economy expands and companies providing technical professional and construction services are required to compete against each other across geographic boundaries the company that can provide its clients with costefficient solutions to their project needs has the advantage with a relentless focus on managing costs we provide savings to clients and deliver superior technical professional and construction services safely efficiently and within the cost and time parameters our clients require 

page 4 

jacobs’ corporate functions include quality and safety finance and administration legal compliance communications global sales and marketing human resources and information technology departments that are integral to our success 

the companys culture 

our employees are our most important and valuable asset and therefore the prevention of jobrelated injuries is given top priority it is the policy of the company to provide and maintain a safe and healthy working environment and to follow operating practices that safeguard all employees and result in a more efficient operation 

beyondzero®  the name of our program that promotes our culture of caring moves beyond efforts to have an incident and injuryfree safety performance we implement a true culture of caring where concern for employees health safety and welfare extends outside the office walls beyond the project site fences and into their homes cars and all the places where they interact with family friends and fellow employees it actively involves employees in championing the safety and wellness of themselves and others  encouraging every employee to have the courage to take action and positively influence the intentions and behaviors of those around them with the belief that the safety and wellness of employees are integrally linked to sound business performance and efficiency in project execution 

since jacobs’ founding the company has been based on doing business honestly ethically and with the utmost integrity our culture and our code of conduct that is signed annually by all employees prescribes that everyone at the company must adhere to jacobs’ core values and ethical code and comply with the laws that govern the company’s activities worldwide our employees and business partners are expected to follow the highest principles of business conduct integrity and ethics as they carry out their responsibilities and are guided by the following principles in carrying out their responsibilities loyalty compliance with applicable laws observance of ethical standards avoidance of conflicts of interest and communication we endeavor to deal fairly with our employees customers suppliers and competitors and to respect the policies and procedures of those outside the company 

our objective is to present a clear and consistent image of our company to our clients employees shareholders and business partners  regarding how we behave how we communicate how we look and most importantly how our promises to our clients are delivered  anywhere in the world 

we accomplish this foremost through our core values which allow us to behave as one company and unify us worldwide by keeping our core values as a central focus of our company we are able to think the same way and arrive at similar conclusions regardless of our physical location our core values are 

 the balance inherent in our core values is also evident in our approach to sustainability which maintains an even balance between the people the economics and the environmental aspects of business jacobs is driven to continuously improve efficiencies and reduce energy and resources practices that drive down costs and contribute to a lower impact on the environment the company adheres to the following seven sus tainability principles 

 

applying the best most efficient and effective sustainable solutions for clients worldwide in all major industries in our clients operate allows us to make a significant contribution to a safe and sustainable future each year we issue a sustainability report  that describes many of our efforts and accomplishments regarding environmental sustainability 

with respect to human resources our goal is to establish an inclusive diverse workplace that energizes the people who fuel our companys growth although we are a large company with over 66300 employees in over 25 countries our 

page 5 

employees are unified in their focus on superior value safety and ethical business practices regardless of the country employees frequently move around the system as they grow their careers and serve clients so everyone at the company is urged to operate with a boundaryless mindset connecting across geographies disciplines and industries to collaborate on innovative solutions that provide maximum value to clients 

how we grow 

jacobs has grown significantly since its founding in 1947 both through organic growth and through strategic acquisition an important part of the company’s growth strategy we have successfully acquired and integrated numerous companies over the years that have enhanced our capabilities geographic reach and offerings 

in terms of organic growth our relationshipbased business model is central to our sustained growth and profitability we pursue the development of longterm relationships and alliances with our clients by working with our clients on their capital programs we increase our understanding of their overall business needs as well as the unique technical requirements of their specific projects this increased understanding enables us we believe to provide superior value to our clients our approach provides us with opportunities to market the services our clients are expected to need in the predesign phase such as master planning permitting or project finance options in the design phase and in the construction poststartup and commissioning phases of a facility including operations and maintenance services 

our relationships with clients also present ongoing opportunities to expand into adjacent markets for example clients operating in the mining and minerals market often have a need for our infrastructure and buildings capabilities the same is true for clients operating in other markets 

we market our services to clients in a wide range of public and institutional process and industrial markets we increase our opportunities through selective market diversity and are able to price contracts more competitively and enhance overall profitability while delivering additional value to our clients by integrating and bundling our services in complex economic times we have the ability to evolve along with market cycles worldwide when opportunities decrease in a particular market or geography other opportunities often increase because of our selective market diversity we believe we are wellpositioned to address a wide range of opportunities across many markets and geographies which helps us grow our business 

closely linked to our relationshipbased business model is our multidomestic geographic strategy our core clients can depend on us for assistance with their engineering and construction needs when they move projects around the world we therefore follow our clients into new geographic regions which helps us perform meaningful portions of their projects by utilizing local resources rather than exporting the work to other offices 

the role of acquisitions and strategic investments in the development our business 

when we review acquisition targets we are conscious of the effect the acquisition may have on our client base we favor acquisitions that allow us to i expand into a new client market ii enhance the range of services we provide existing clients andor iii access new geographic areas in which our clients either already operate or plan to expand by expanding into new geographic areas and adding to our existing technical and project management capabilities we strive to position ourselves as a preferred singlesource provider of technical professional and construction services to our major clients the following is a brief description of some of our recent key acquisitions in chronological order

 page 7 

 after we complete an acquisition we generally move very quickly to integrate the newlyacquired operations we typically assign senior operations personnel to manage the overall integration process with assistance from our sales accounting legal it human resources and risk management departments although integrating newly acquired businesses can be very challenging the assimilation process is critical in order to assure i that our global businesses processes and systems are properly deployed throughout the newlyacquired entities and ii that we can begin to leverageoff the acquired talents skills and expertise to grow our business and help our clients execute their capital programs newlyacquired businesses are generally not left as standalone entities within the company’s internal reporting system the businesses we acquire are typically folded in to existing operational organizations within the company for additional information regarding certain issues related to our acquisition strategy please refer to item 1a— r isk factors below

financial information about segments 

although we describe our business in this annual report on form 10k in terms of the various services we provide the markets in which our clients operate and the geographic areas in which we operate we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment pursuant to those accounting principles generally accepted in the us “us gaap” in making this determination we considered the various economic characteristics of our operations including the nature of the services we provide the nature of our internal processes for delivering and distributing those services and the types of customers we have in addition to the discussion that follows please refer to note 14 — segment information  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

there is a high degree of similarity among the workforces employed across the categories of services we provide for example professionals in engineering and design services ie services provided by persons who are degreed and in certain circumstances licensed such as engineers architects scientists and economists exist in all four service categories in addition there is a high degree of similarity among a significant component of the workforces we employ to perform construction and operations and maintenance om projects in providing construction and om services we employ a large number of skilled craft labor personnel these may include welders pipe fitters electricians crane operators and other personnel who work on very large capital projects in the case of projects classified within the construction services category or on smaller capital projects in the case of maintenance projects classified within the om services category 

all of our offices use a matrix organizational structure our results therefore are dependent on groups representing technical disciplines eg electrical engineering mechanical engineering cost engineering etc supporting project management personnel who maintain the relationship between our clients and us and are ultimately responsible for delivering projects to our clients safely on time and on budget additionally all of our operating regions use common tools policies and procedures to manage and run their respective units these include project review meetings project performance evaluations and project execution plans 

  

each of the companys operating regions provides most of the services the company offers generally and each of our operating regions includes in its customer base many of the same or similar clients as our other regions 

the use of technology throughout our organization is highly uniform whether it is computeraided design and drafting “cadd” applications used by our engineering and design staff or modeling programs used by the scientific and consulting staff or scheduling estimating and cost control applications used by homeoffice personnel in support of our construction and maintenance activities all of the service categories described above are equally affected by changes in technology as they occur in the economy at large 

furthermore the types of information and internal reports used by the company’s chief operating decision maker the “codm” who is also the company’s chief executive officer and other members of management to monitor performance evaluate results of operations allocate resources and otherwise manage the business support a single reportable segment accordingly based on these similarities we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment for purposes of the disclosures included in this annual report on form 10k

services provided 

as described above the services we provide generally fall into the following four broad categories project services process scientific and systems consulting services construction services and operations and maintenance omservices 

the following table sets forth our revenues from each of our four service categories for each of the last five fiscal years in thousands 



project services 

we employ the engineering architecture interiors design planning and related disciplines necessary to design and engineer modern process plants buildings infrastructure projects technology and manufacturing facilities consumer products manufacturing facilities power plants and stations pulp and paper plants and other facilities 

we are capable of providing our clients with a variety of value engineering services including safety in design through safety in design we integrate best practices hazard analysis and risk assessment methods early in the design phase of projects taking those steps necessary to eliminate or mitigate injury and damage during the construction startup testing and commissioning and operations phases of a project 

in the area of construction management we provide our clients with a wide range of services as an agent for our clients we may act as program director whereby we oversee on the owners behalf the complete planning design and construction phases of the project alternatively our services may be limited to providing construction consulting 

project services also includes planning scheduling procurement estimating cost engineering project accounting quality and safety and all other key support services needed for complete cradletograve project delivery 

process scientific and systems consulting services 

we employ the professional and technical skills and expertise with respect to a broad range of consulting services including performing pricing studies market analyses and financial projections necessary in determining the feasibility of a project performing gasoline reformulation modeling analyzing and evaluating layout and mechanical designs for complex processing plants analyzing automation and control systems analyzing designing and executing biocontainment strategies developing and performing process protocols with respect to the us food and drug administrationmandated qualification and validation requirements and performing geological and metallurgical studies 

also included in this service category are revenues relating to defense and aerospacerelated programs such services typically are more technical and scientific in nature than other project services we provide and may involve such tasks as supporting the development and testing of conventional weapons systems weapons modeling and simulations computer systems development maintenance and support evaluation and testing of missioncritical control systems aerospace testing and propulsion systems and facilities and other highly technical or scientific tasks 

construction services 

in addition to the construction management services included under project services above we provide traditional field construction services to private and public sector clients we also provide our clients with a modular construction option our modular construction includes the engineering and construction of a facility in an offsite fabrication and assembly environment with final completion during the field erection phase the option provides our clients with an alternative approach to traditional methods of engineering and construction which can compress and shorten the construction schedule reduce risk lower costs and provide environmental benefits in the area of environmental remediation and restoration we also provide environmental remedial construction services for a variety of public and private sector clients 

page 10 

historically our field construction activities have been focused primarily on those construction projects for which we perform much of the related engineering and design work by focusing our construction efforts in this way we minimize the risks associated with constructing complex projects based on designs prepared by third parties the financial risk to us of constructing complex assets based on designs prepared by third parties may be particularly significant on fixedprice contracts therefore we generally avoid this type of project however we will pursue constructiononly projects when we can negotiate pricing and other contract terms we deem acceptable and which we believe can result in a fair return for the degree of risk we assume 

operations and maintenance om services 

om refers to all of the tasks required to operate and maintain large complex facilities on behalf of clients we provide key management and support services over all aspects of the operations of a facility including managing subcontractors and other onsite personnel om also includes process plant maintenance services which generally involves all tasks required to keep a process plant typically a refinery or chemical plant in daytoday operation 

within the aerospace and defense areas om often requires us to provide the management and technical support services necessary to operate and maintain such sites as engine test facilities weapons integration facilities and hightech simulation and verification centers such om contracts also frequently require us to provide facilities management and maintenance services utilities operations and maintenance services property management and disposition services and construction support services 

within the environmental area om often includes engineering and technical support services as well as program management services necessary to remediate contaminated sites 

although the gross profit margins we realize from om services are generally lower than those associated with the other services we provide the costs to support maintenance activities are also generally lower also om services offer us an opportunity for longterm relationships with clients this aspect of om services greatly reduces the selling costs in respect of such services

backlog 

backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us with respect to om contracts however we include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for only one succeeding year regardless of the remaining life of the contract for national government programs other than us federal om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding option periods in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation termination or suspension at the discretion of the client in addition the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts accordingly backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings 

our backlog includes expected revenues for contracts that are based on estimates for additional information regarding our backlog including those risk factors specific to backlog please refer to item 1a — risk factors  and item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  below 

significant customers 

the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government for each of the last five fiscal years   



it is uncommon for a commercial customer to contribute 10 or more of the company’s total revenues on occasion however we will perform a number of field services projects for a single customer in the same fiscal year which primarily because of the amount of passthrough costs discussed below that is included in revenue will cause total revenue from that customer to exceed 10 of total consolidated revenues for additional information regarding certain risks related to our customer concentration please refer to item 1a — risk factors  below

contracts 

while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake our contracts generally fall into two broad categories costreimbursable and fixedprice the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the last five fiscal years 

  



in accordance with industry practice most of our contracts including those with the us federal government are subject to termination at the discretion of the client which is discussed in greater detail in item 1a — risk factors in such situations our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination 

when we are directly responsible for engineering design procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client’s plant or facility we reflect the costs of materials equipment and subcontracts in both revenues and costs on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs the following table sets forth the approximate amount of such passthrough costs included in revenues for each of the last five fiscal years in millions of dollars 

  



costreimbursable contracts 

costreimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit the profit element may be in the form of a simple markup applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee or a combination of a markup and a fee the fee element can also take several forms the fee may be a fixed amount it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred or it may be an incentive fee based on targets milestones or performance factors defined in the contract in general we prefer costreimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price 

fixedprice contracts 

fixedprice contracts include both “lump sum bid” contracts and “negotiated fixedprice” contracts under lump sum bid contracts we typically bid against other contractors based on specifications the client furnishes this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period additionally it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients which is contrary to our relationshipbased business model accordingly lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract in contrast under a negotiated fixedprice contract we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client negotiated fixedprice contracts frequently exist in singleresponsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project thus although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us however because of economies that may be realized during the contract term both negotiated fixedprice and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts over the past five years most of our fixedprice work has been either negotiated fixedprice contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services rather than turnkey construction 

competition

 item 1a risk factors 

we operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future we may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial if any such events actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces if we fail to maintain safe work sites we can be exposed to significant financial losses as well as civil and criminal liabilities 

construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment moving vehicles chemical and manufacturing processes and highly regulated materials on many sites we are responsible for safety and accordingly must implement safety procedures if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective our employees and others may become injured unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover increase the cost of a project to our clients and raise our operating costs any of the foregoing could result in financial losses which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials which if improperly handled or disposed of could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health safety and environmental “hse” work procedures throughout our organization including construction sites and maintenance sites the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability 

our safety record is critical to our reputation many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures as a result our failure to maintain adequate safety standards could result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our project execution activities may result in liability for faulty engineering services   

our failure to make judgments and recommendations in accordance with applicable professional standards could result in large damages our engineering practice for example involves professional judgments regarding the planning design development construction operations and management of industrial facilities and public infrastructure projects while we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages and although we have adopted a range of insurance risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities a catastrophic event at one of our project sites or completed projects resulting from the services we have performed could result in significant professional or product liability warranty or other claims against us as well as reputational harm especially if public safety is impacted these liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or the fees we generate or could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future in addition clients or subcontractors who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us an uninsured claim either in part or in whole if successful and of a material magnitude could have a substantial impact on our operations 

the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are a party to litigation in the normal course of business since we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities and projects where design construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or others we are exposed to substantial claims and litigation if there is a failure at any such project such claims could relate to among other things personal injury loss of life business interruption property damage pollution and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties such as those who use or reside near our clients’ projects we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met in many of our contracts with clients subcontractors and vendors we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages penalties losses and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts in addition while 

page 19 

clients and subcontractors may agree to indemnify us against certain liabilities such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us 

we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations our insurance programs have varying coverage limits and maximums and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make in addition we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under these programs as a result we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured 

although in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future or that such insurance can be economically secured for example catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits more limited coverage increased premium costs or deductibles we also monitor the financial health of the insurance companies from which we procure insurance and this is one of the factors we take into account when purchasing insurance our insurance is purchased from a number of the worlds leading providers often in layered insurance or quota share arrangements if any of our third party insurers fail abruptly cancel our coverage or otherwise cannot satisfy their insurance requirements to us then our overall risk exposure and operational expenses could be increased and our business operations could be interrupted 

in addition the nature of our business sometimes results in clients subcontractors and vendors presenting claims to us for among other things recovery of costs related to certain projects similarly we occasionally present change orders and other claims to our clients subcontractors and vendors if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients subcontractors and vendors we could incur cost overruns reduced profits or in some cases a loss for a project a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results additionally irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant 

litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability product liability criminal liability warranty obligations and other liabilities which to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we bear the risk of cost overruns in fixedprice contracts we may experience reduced profits or in some cases losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates 

for fiscal 2014  approximately 170  of our revenues were earned under contracts that were fixedprice in nature for these contracts we bear the risk of paying some if not all of any cost overruns fixedprice contract amounts are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions including those about future economic conditions prices and availability of labor equipment and materials and other exigencies if these estimates prove inaccurate there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications or if circumstances change due to among other things unanticipated technical problems difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals changes in local laws or labor conditions weather delays changes in the costs of raw materials or our vendors’ or subcontractors’ inability to perform then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or in some cases a loss for that project if the project is significant or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our vulnerability to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our clients operate is exacerbated during economic downturns or time of political uncertainty 

we provide technical professional construction and om services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration production and refining programs for various national governments including the us federal government chemicals and polymers mining and minerals pharmaceuticals and biotechnology infrastructure buildings power and other general industrial and consumer businesses and markets such as technology and manufacturing pulp and paper and food and consumer products these markets and the resulting demand for our services have been and we expect will continue to be cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control including economic conditions and changes in client spending particularly during periods of economic or political uncertainty 

page 20 

current global economic and political conditions have negatively impacted many of our clients’ ability and willingness to fund their projects they have also caused our clients to reduce their capital expenditures alter the mix of services purchased seek more favorable price and other contract terms and otherwise slow their spending on our services for example in the public sector declines in state tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending in addition due to these conditions many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable these conditions have reduced the demand for our services which has had a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations 

current economic and political conditions also make it extremely difficult for our clients our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could cause businesses to continue to slow spending on our services we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery worldwide or in our clients’ markets in addition our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and therefore may not recover as quickly as the economy at large a continuation or worsening of current weak economic conditions or a reduction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

regardless of economic or market conditions investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients’ markets and investment decisions as a result our past results have varied and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate 

fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers’ investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation delays in existing work or changes in the timing and funding of new awards 

commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways for example for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil gas copper or fertilizers fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and therefore their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments to the extent commodity prices decline and our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects the demand for our services decreases which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned as well as those in progress and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel 

the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel including engineers architects designers craft personnel and corporate management professionals who have the required experience and expertise from time to time it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients in certain geographic areas for example we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel 

in addition as some of our key personnel approach retirement age we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the cost of providing our services including the extent to which we utilize our workforce affects our profitability for example the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts if an expected contract award is delayed or not received we could incur costs resulting from excess staff reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business financial conditions and results of operations 

page 21 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies which are a significant source of our revenue and profit are subject to various uncertainties restrictions and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities as well as cost controls government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding such as sequestration contracts with the us federal government for example are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for government programs may even be eliminated 

as a result our government clients may reduce the scope or terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues for example those with the us federal government represented approximately 178  of our total revenue in fiscal 2014  a significant reduction in government funding or the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

most government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process the us federal government has increasingly relied upon multipleyear contacts with multiple contractors that generally require those contractors to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under a contract this process may result in us facing significant additional pricing pressure and uncertainty and incurring additional costs moreover we may not be awarded government contracts because of existing policies designed to protect small businesses and underrepresented minorities our inability to win new contracts or be awarded work under existing contracts could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 

in addition government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socioeconomic requirements which affects how we transact business with our clients and in some instances impose additional costs on our business operations for example for contracts with the us federal government we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation the truth in negotiations act the cost accounting standards the service contract act and numerous regulations governing environmental protection and employment practices government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than nongovernment contracts this includes for example unlimited indemnification obligations 

we also are subject to government audits investigations and proceedings for example government agencies such as the us defense contract audit agency routinely review and audit us to determine the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies and whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations these audits can result in a determination that a rule or regulation has been violated or that adjustments are necessary to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies 

if we violate a rule or regulation fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit a variety of penalties can be imposed including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties in addition any or all of our government contracts could be terminated we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work or payment of our costs could be disallowed for example in socalled qui tam actions brought by individuals or the government under the us federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws treble damages can be awarded the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances which can be difficult and time consuming to obtain if our employees are unable to obtain or retain the necessary securities clearances our clients could terminate or not renew existing contracts or award us new contracts to the extent this occurs our operations and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted cancelled or suspended by our clients and therefore our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings additionally even if fully performed our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins 

as of the end of fiscal 2014  our backlog totaled approximately 184 billion  there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or if realized will result in profits in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation termination or suspension at the discretion of the client 

page 22 

in addition the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts the revenue for certain contracts included in backlog are based on estimates projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns 

additionally the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence future profitability in some markets there is a continuing trend towards costreimbursable contracts with incentivefee arrangements typically our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs overall safety performance overall client satisfaction and other performance criteria if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards we may receive a lower or even zero incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins accordingly there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog assuming they produce the revenues currently expected will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past 

negative conditions in the credit and financial markets and delays in receiving client payments could result in liquidity problems 

although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions in addition some of our clients depend on the availability of credit to help finance their capital projects instability in the credit markets in the us or abroad could cause the availability of credit to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain this situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds refinance our existing indebtedness enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us we may also enter into business acquisition agreements that require us to access credit which if not available at the closing of the acquisition could result in a breach of the acquisition agreement and a resulting claim for damages by the sellers of such business in addition market conditions could negatively impact our clients’ ability to fund their projects and therefore utilize our services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors suppliers and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements on less favorable terms with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are therefore subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices in weak economic environments we may experience increased delays and failures due to among other reasons a diminution in our clients’ access to the credit markets if one or more clients delays in paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

furthermore our cash balances and shortterm investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america europe south america australia and asia some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership or have been seized by their governments there is a risk that this may occur in the future if this were to occur we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund operations 

our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control 

as is common in the industry we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures partnerships and similar arrangements this situation exposes us to a number of risks including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients our partners may also be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships if these circumstances occur we may be required to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages provide additional services or make additional investments to ensure adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services under agreements with joint and several liabilities we could be liable for both our obligations and those of our partners these 

page 23 

circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner in these cases we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the failure by a joint venture partner to comply with applicable laws regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and for government clients could result in fines penalties suspension or even debarment being imposed on us which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts 

much of the work performed under our contracts is performed by thirdparty subcontractors we hire we also rely on thirdparty equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired if we are not able to locate qualified thirdparty subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated especially in a lumpsum or a fixedprice contract we may suffer losses on these contracts if a subcontractor supplier or manufacturer fails to provide services supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason we may be required to source these services equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms which could impact contract profitability in the current economic environment third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party’s ability to provide materials equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a failure by a third party subcontractor supplier or manufacturer to comply with applicable laws regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and for government clients could result in fines penalties suspension or even debarment being imposed on us which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

maintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts 

in line with industry practice we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds to our customers these bonds indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract if a bond is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond we cannot pursue that project 

historically we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity but as is typically the case the issuance of a bond is at the surety’s sole discretion and the issuance of a letter of credit is based on the companys credit worthiness because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms our inability to obtain adequate bonding and as a result to bid on new contracts that require such bonding could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

past and future environmental heath and safety laws could impose significant additional costs and liabilities 

we are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities 

various us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants the liability under these laws is joint and several we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current 

page 24 

and prior ownership of various properties the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen cleanup obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

when we perform our services our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions we may be subject to liability claims by employees customers and third parties as a result of such exposures in addition we may be subject to fines penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws a claim if not covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

such laws regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could for example relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and in turn could negatively impact our revenue our failure to comply with such laws or regulations whether actual or alleged could expose us to fines penalties or potential litigation liabilities including costs settlements and judgments any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments which may require us or our clients to obtain and to comply with federal state and local government permits and approvals any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial revocation or modification under various circumstances failure to obtain or comply with or the loss or modification of the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and result of operations 

if we fail to comply with federal state local or foreign governmental requirements our business may be adversely affected 

we are subject to us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business for example our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders although we have policies and procedures to comply with us and foreign international trade laws the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and could damage our reputation and therefore our ability to do business 

employee agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts which could result in reduced revenues and profits 

misconduct fraud noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or other improper activities by one of our employees agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations regulations regarding the protection of classified information regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts regulations on lobbying or similar activities regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting environmental laws and any other applicable laws or regulations for example we routinely provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters if a security breach were to occur our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective and we could face unknown risks or losses our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act of 2010 and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices despite our training and compliance programs there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

page 25 

the loss of or a significant reduction in business from one or a few customers could have an adverse impact on us 

a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue andor backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years for example in fiscal 2014  2013  and fiscal 2012  approximately 178  199  and 221  respectively of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government although we have longstanding relationships with many of our significant clients our clients may unilaterally reduce delay or cancel their contracts at any time our loss of or a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we engage in a highly competitive business if we are unable to compete effectively we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

we face intense competition to provide technical professional and construction services to clients the extent of such competition varies by industry geographic market and project type for example with respect to our construction and operations and maintenance services clients generally award large projects to large contractors which may give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects conversely with respect to our engineering design architectural and consulting services low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller newer competitors if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both which if significant could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our larger competitors for engineering construction and maintenance services for process plants include bechtel fluor foster wheeler kbr technip worleyparsons cbi and amec in the area of buildings our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr hok aecom and turner in the area of infrastructure our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as parsons brinckerhoff hntb tetra tech parsons and ws atkins in the area of national government programs our principal competitors include several of the competitors listed above as well as leidos ch2m hill weston lockheed martin and computer sciences corporation 

in addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in risk factors our international operations are also exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies 

for fiscal 2014  approximately 442  of our revenues was earned from clients outside the us our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues our international operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

  

 the lack of a welldeveloped legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights in addition military action or continued unrest particularly in the middle east could impact the supply or pricing of oil disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or 

page 26 

adverse economic political and other conditions our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we work in international locations where there are high security risks which could result in harm to our employees or unanticipated cost 

some of our services are performed in high risk locations where the country or location is subject to political social or economic risks or war or civil unrest in those locations where we have employees or operations we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel despite these activities in these locations we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel and we may suffer future losses of employees and subcontractors 

foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects 

our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects both positive and negative that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar into the us dollar while we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in the currencies of our expenditures we do enter into contracts that expose us to currency risk particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs we attempt to minimize our exposure from currency risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies or entering into derivative hedging instruments when there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts these actions however may not always eliminate currency risk exposure based on fluctuations in currency the us dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly we may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries 

our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties 

our business strategy involves growth through among other things the acquisition of other companies acquiring companies presents a number of risks including 

 while we often obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses such rights may be difficult to enforce the losses may exceed any dedicated escrow funds and the indemnitors may not have the ability to financially support the indemnity 

in addition there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us existing cash balances and cash flow from operations together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities may be insufficient to make acquisitions credit market conditions may also make it more difficult and costly to finance acquisitions acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 

page 27 

in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make we could dilute share ownership 

one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities accordingly we filed a shelf registration statement on form s4 on december 7 2007 if we issue additional equity securities pursuant to this shelf registration statement or otherwise such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders’ individual ownership percentages in the company 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock because of a number of factors including 

 our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements 

in preparing our financial statements our management is required under us gaap to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities areas requiring significant estimates by our management include 

 our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

an impairment charge of goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

under us gaap we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach as of september 26 2014  we had 30 billion  of goodwill representing 358  of our total assets of 85 billion  we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at 

page 28 

the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business potential government actions toward our facilities and other factors 

if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value we could be required to record an impairment charge the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing please see item 7— management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  below 

we may be required to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and postretirement benefit plans we manage 

we have various employee benefit plan obligations that require us to make contributions to satisfy over time our underfunded benefit obligations which are generally determined by calculating the projected benefit obligations minus the fair value of plan assets for example as of september 26 2014  and september 27 2013  our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans were projected to be underfunded by 4008 million  and 4025 million  respectively see note 6— pension plans  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k for additional disclosure in the future our benefit plan obligations may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of interest rates pension plan asset performance and other factors if we are required to contribute a significant amount of the deficit for underfunded benefit plans our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

rising inflation interest rates andor construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts in particular with respect to our fixedprice contracts 

rising inflation interest rates or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services in addition we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixedprice because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from costreimbursable type contracts approximately 830  during fiscal 2014  the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor however if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixedprice and lumpsum work is more prevalent inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future therefore increases in inflation interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change 

growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations for example there is a growing consensus that new and additional regulations may be enacted concerning among other things greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased compliance costs for us and our clients legislation international protocols regulation or other restrictions on emissions could also affect our clients including those who are involved in the exploration production or refining of fossil fuels such changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or in some cases prevent a project from going forward thereby potentially reducing the need for our services which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations however these changes could also increase the pace of projects such as carbon capture or storage projects that could have a positive impact on our business we cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers 

our effective tax rate may increase or decrease 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation the introduction of new tax accounting standards legislation regulations and related interpretations our global mix of earnings the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

page 29 

systems and information technology interruption could adversely impact our ability to operate 

we rely heavily on computer information and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business from time to time we experience occasional system interruptions and delays in the event we are unable to regularly deploy software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems the operation of such systems could be interrupted or result in the loss corruption or release of data in addition our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters telecommunications failures acts of war or terrorism computer viruses physical or electronic security breaches intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error or similar events or disruptions any of these or other events could cause interruptions delays loss of critical andor sensitive data or similar effects which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition protection of intellectual property and results of operations as well as those of our clients 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or that of our clients 

our technology and intellectual property provide us in many instances with a competitive advantage although we protect our property through patent registrations license restrictions and similar mechanisms we may not be able to successfully preserve our rights and they could be invalidated circumvented challenged or become obsolete in addition the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the us if we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced in addition our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property there is a risk we may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and as a result could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities loss of contracts or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control 

extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control such as natural or manmade disasters could negatively impact our ability to operate as an example from time to time we face unexpected severe weather conditions which may result in weatherrelated delays that are not always reimbursable under a fixedprice contract evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services increased labor and material costs in areas resulting from weatherrelated damage and subsequent increased demand for labor and materials for repairing and rebuilding inability to deliver materials equipment and personnel to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules and loss of productivity we may remain obligated to perform our services after any such natural or manmade event unless a force majeure clause or other contractual provision provides us with relief from our contractual obligations if we are not able to react quickly to such events or if a high concentration of our projects are in a specific geographic region that suffers from a natural or manmade catastrophe our operations may be significantly affected which could have a negative impact on our operations in addition if we cannot complete our contracts on time we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients which may reduce our profits 

we are subject to professional standards duties and statutory obligations on professional reports and opinions we issue which could subject us to monetary damages 

we issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional engineering expertise as well as our other professional credentials that subject us to professional standards duties and obligations regulating the performance of our services for example we issue opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings if a client or another third party alleges that our report or opinion is incorrect or it is improperly relied upon and we are held responsible we could be subject to significant monetary damages 

delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control 

we are a delaware corporation certain antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us in addition certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover for example 

 page 30 

 these types of provisions as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders accordingly stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend critical accounting policies 

in order to understand better the changes that occur to key elements of our financial condition results of operations and cash flows a reader of this management’s discussion and analysis “mda” should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business performing longterm engineering and constructiontype contracts requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect both the entity’s results of operations and the carrying values of its assets and liabilities although our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 – significant accounting policies  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k the following discussion is intended to highlight and describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue accounting for contracts and use of joint ventures —in general we recognize revenues at the time we provide services depending on the commercial terms of the contract we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred or using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion this method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress as of the balance sheet dates in making such estimates judgments are required to evaluate the possible effects of variances in schedule the costs of materials and labor productivity and the impact of change orders claims contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee for contracts containing incentive fee arrangements fees are frequently based on achievement of target completion dates target costs andor other performance criteria failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or nonrecoverable costs which could exceed revenues recognized from the project 

we provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known without regard to the percentage of completion for multiple contracts with a single customer we account for each contract separately 

the nature of our business sometimes results in clients subcontractors or vendors presenting claims to us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible in those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract we include in the total estimated costs of the contract and therefore the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract an estimate based on all relevant facts and circumstances available of the additional costs to be incurred similarly and in the normal course of business we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible in those situations where we have presented such claims to our clients we include in revenues the amount of costs incurred without profit to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims 

certain costreimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment in this situation revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts in those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs that are not allowable under the terms of the contract we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly 

as is common to the industry we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures and consortiums although the joint ventures own and hold the contracts with the clients the services required by the contracts are typically performed by us and our joint venture partners or by other subcontractors under subcontracting agreements with the joint ventures the assets of our joint ventures therefore consist almost entirely of cash and receivables representing amounts due from clients and the liabilities of our joint ventures consist almost entirely of amounts due to the joint venture partners for services provided by the partners to the joint ventures under their individual subcontracts and other subcontractors in general at any given time the equity of our joint ventures represents the undistributed profits earned on contracts the joint ventures hold with clients very few of our joint ventures have employees none of our joint ventures have 

page 36 

thirdparty debt or credit facilities our joint ventures therefore are simply mechanisms used to deliver engineering and construction services to clients rarely do they in and of themselves present any risk of loss to us or to our partners separate from those that we would carry if we were performing the contract on our own under us gaap our share of losses associated with the contracts held by the joint ventures if and when they occur has always been reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

in evaluating the companys joint ventures also referred to as variable interest entities or vies for accounting and consolidation purposes we perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether or not the company has a “controlling financial interest” in the vie the company is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a vie if it has i the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and ii the right to receive benefits or obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie in making our qualitative analysis the company assesses each vie to determine those activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and whether the company another entity or multiple entities have the power to direct those activities 

  if we determine that we have the power to direct those activities of the vie that most significantly impact its financial performance and have the right or obligation to receive benefits or absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie then we are the primary beneficiary of the vie and we consolidate the vie if we determine that we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the vie or power is shared by two or more unrelated parties then we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not consolidate the vie 

for the companys unconsolidated joint ventures we use either the equity method of accounting or proportional consolidation the company does not currently participate in any significant vies in which it has a controlling financial interest there were no changes in facts and circumstances in the period that caused the company to reassess the method of accounting for its vies 

accounting for stock issued to employees and others — we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the estimated grantdate fair value of the award we estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors using the blackscholes optionpricing model like all optionpricing models the blackscholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions including i the expected volatility of the market price of the underlying stock and ii the expected term of the award among others accordingly changes in assumptions and any subsequent adjustments to those assumptions can cause drastically different fair values to be assigned to our stock option awards for restricted stock units containing service and performance conditions with measures external to the company compensation expense is based on the fair value of such units determined using monte carlo simulations due to the uncertainties inherent in the use of assumptions and the results of applying monte carlo simulations the amount of expense recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the effects on our future consolidated financial statements because equity awards tend to vest over several years and additional equity awards may be made in the future 

accounting for pension plans — the accounting for pension plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans’ assets and liabilities these assumptions include discount rates investment returns and projected salary increases among others the actuarial assumptions used in determining the funded statuses of the plans are provided in note 6 – pension plans  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

the expected rates of return on plan assets for fiscal 2015 range from 45 to 85 compared to 04 to 85 for the prior year we believe the range of rates selected for fiscal 2015 reflects the longterm returns expected on the plans’ assets considering recent market conditions projected rates of inflation the diversification of the plans’ assets and the expected real rates of market returns the discount rates used to compute plan liabilities were changed from a range of 04 to 93 in fiscal 2013 to a range of 18 to 88 in fiscal 2014 these assumptions represent the company’s best estimate of the rates at which its pension obligations could be effectively settled 

changes in the actuarial assumptions often have a material effect on the values assigned to plan assets and liabilities and the associated pension expense for example if the discount rate used to value the net pension benefit obligation “pbo” at september 26 2014 was higher lower by 05 the pbo would have been lower higher at that date by approximately 920 million for nonus plans and by approximately 211 million for us plans if the expected return on plan assets was higher lower by 10 the net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2015 would be lower higher by approximately 88 million for nonus plans and by approximately 38 million for us plans differences between actuarial assumptions and actual performance ie actuarial gains and losses that are not recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost in the period 

page 37 

in which such differences arise are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are recognized as part of net periodic pension cost in future periods in accordance with us gaap management monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in an effort to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used 

  

contractual guarantees litigation investigations and insurance — in the normal course of business we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation the guarantees to which we are a party generally relate to project schedules and plant performance most of the litigation in which we are involved has us as a defendant in workers’ compensation personal injury environmental employmentlabor professional liability and other similar lawsuits we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations we have elected however to retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under our insurance programs this situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured and we intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of our contracts 

in accordance with us gaap we record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such guarantees litigation and insurance claims we include any adjustments to such liabilities in our consolidated results of operations 

in addition as a contractor providing services to the us federal government and several of its agencies we are subject to many levels of audits investigations and claims by or on behalf of the us federal government with respect to contract performance pricing costs cost allocations and procurement practices we adjust revenues based upon the amounts we expect to realize considering the effects of any client audits or governmental investigations 

testing goodwill for possible impairment — the goodwill carried on our consolidated balance sheets is tested annually for possible impairment in performing the annual impairment test we evaluate our goodwill at the reporting unit level we have determined that we have two reporting units which are based on geography we refer to these reporting units internally as “europe” and “noneurope” each of our reporting units conducts the business activities described elsewhere in this 2014 form 10k which includes providing professional technical services such as design engineering and architectural services construction andor construction management services and operations and maintenance services 

our geographybased reporting units reflect the company’s organizational structure which is based predominately on geography as well as our acquisition strategy which favors acquisition targets that among other things provide access to new geographic areas our reporting units represent rational groupings into which substantially all of our major acquisitions which are responsible for the goodwill appearing in our consolidated balance sheets have been assimilated and where all of the operations under each reporting unit share in the benefits of the goodwill created by our acquisitions 

us gaap does not prescribe a specific valuation method for estimating the fair value of reporting units the valuation technique used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including revenue growth rates operating margins discount rates and future market conditions among others 

page 38 

for fiscal years 2013 through 2014 we used both an income approach and a market approach to test our goodwill for possible impairment such approaches require us to make estimates and judgments under the income approach fair value is determined by using the discounted cash flows of our reporting units under the market approach the fair value of our reporting units is determined by reference to guideline companies that are reasonably comparable to our reporting units the fair values are estimated based on the valuation multiples of the invested capital associated with the guideline companies in assessing whether there is an indication that the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired we utilize the results of both valuation techniques and consider the range of fair values indicated the fair values for each reporting unit exceeded the respective book values by over 40  the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units in our testing were 

income approach 

2013 assumptions 

• company financial projections for fiscal years 2013 to 2016 

• weighted average cost of capital of 11 

• residual period growth rate of 3 

2014 assumptions

with respect to the market approach for guideline publicly traded companies reasonably comparable to the companys reporting units the company used multiples ranging from 63 to 80 of ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and 80 to 97 of ebit earnings before interest and taxes for the fiscal year 2013 test applied to the projected fiscal year 2013 financial results for each of our reporting units the company used multiples ranging from 59 to 76 of ebitda and 76 to 100 of ebit for the fiscal year 2014 test applied to the projected fiscal year 2014 financial results for each of our reporting units 

it is possible that changes in market conditions economy facts and circumstances judgments and assumptions used in estimating the fair value could change resulting in possible impairment of goodwill in the future the fair values resulting from the valuation techniques used are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of the reporting units to willing third parties 

the company performs the annual goodwill impairment test for the reporting units at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year the company will test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount we have determined that the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values for fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 

based on the most recent results of our annual impairment tests there were no indications of impairment of the goodwill shown in our consolidated balance sheets at either september 26 2014 or september 27 2013 furthermore the company performed an interim impairment assessment at september 26 2014 and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of either reporting unit had been reduced to an amount below its carrying amount

the company’s net earnings decreased   950 million  or 225  from 4231 million  for fiscal 2013  to 3281 million  for fiscal 2014  in addition to the effects of the 2014 restructuring and the acquisition of skm the companys consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2014  were affected by the other 2014 events described above 

above we disclose and discuss our results of operations before the effects of the 2014 restructuring or the other transactions and events described above although such information is nongaap in nature it is presented because management believes it provides additional context for investors to better understand the company’s operating results to investors to assess the company’s performance and operating trends 

 backlog at september 26 2014  increased   12 billion  or 67  to 184 billion  the increase  for the year due primarily to the acquisitions of skm and fns combined with new awards from clients operating in the refiningdownstream infrastructure and chemicals and polymers industry groups and markets among others 

results of operations 

general 

our business focuses exclusively on providing technical professional services and field services to a large number of industrial commercial and governmental clients around the world the services we provide generally fall into four broad categories 

 the scope of services we can provide our clients therefore ranges from consulting and conceptual design services which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project to complete singleresponsibility designbuild contracts to services required in the post startup phases of a project such as om services 

page 41 

the following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each of the last three fiscal years in thousands 

  



project services revenues for the year ended september 26 2014  increased   5981 million  or 100  from the corresponding period last year the increase was due primarily to revenues attributable to skm also contributing to the increases were higher levels of activity in several of industry groups and markets we serve including buildings chemicals and polymers and refiningdownstream 

whereas construction revenues for the year ended september 26 2014  increased   3129 million  or 82  from the corresponding period last year revenues from process scientific and systems consulting and om services for fiscal 2014 were relatively unchanged from the prior year the increase in construction revenues during fiscal 2014 as compared to last year was due primarily to projects for customers operating in the chemicals and polymers market and the mining and minerals industries in the us 

we focus our services on clients operating in select industry groups and markets we believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit crossutilization of our resources the following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each of the last three fiscal years in thousands 

  

revenues increased 8768 million  or 74  from 118 billion  for fiscal 2013  to 127 billion  for fiscal 2014  

revenues from clients operating in the chemicals and polymers industries increased   5942 million  or 249  from 24 billion  for fiscal 2013  to 30 billion  for fiscal 2014  this increase  occurred throughout many of the geographic locations in which we operate we continue to receive new awards for feed frontend engineering design and prefeed services we have longterm relationships with numerous chemical companies around the world and we believe this industry group will provide strong growth opportunities longterm we see particularly strong growth potential in north america and the middle east due to the growing source of available feedstock leveraging our geographic presence as strengthened by the skm 

page 42 

transaction we were recently awarded a significant professional services contract for what will be the largest chlorine dioxide plant in the world located in asia although we see good growth opportunities for this element of our business particularly as they relate to methanol derivatives and other projects we continue to see owners take a measured approach to releasing succeeding phases of their capital projects 

revenues from clients operating in the infrastructure market increased   3457 million  or 340  from 10 billion  for fiscal 2013  to 14 billion  for fiscal 2014  skm contributed approximately 500 of the increase with the uk and us legacy operations contributing to the remainder of the increase  we see this market as strong particularly in several of the submarkets within this industry group particularly for transportation and water projects one example is the asset management programme amp6 cycle in the uk where we believe the company is well positioned to assist clients improve their relative efficiency and wastewater effluent quality we also see increasing momentum behind transportation infrastructure projects in many of the geographies in which we operate also included in this revenue category is our growing services to customers operating in the telecommunications industry longterm we see this market as attracting significant capital as countries around the world strive to improve and expand their wireless communications capabilities 

revenues from clients operating in the buildings market increased   957 million  or 130  from 7384 million  for fiscal 2013  to  8341 million  for fiscal 2014  although skm was responsible for most of this increase  the company saw growth in our us and middle east markets we also see growth potential in parts of north africa where we believe we are well portioned to capitalize on buildings projects with high technical content eg health care aviation and education we view the buildings market as improving as our business continues to shift towards projects for clients in the private sector 

revenues from clients operating in the mining and minerals markets increased   2063 million  or 290  from 7123 million  for fiscal 2013  to 9186 million  for fiscal 2014  the increased  revenues in 2014 was due primarily to skm globally our clients in these industries continue to behave conservatively when it comes to new spend in addition although we believe consolidation among companies in this industry will provide more stable capital spending in the longterm such actions may have significant impacts in the shortterm nevertheless we believe we will be able to capture additional market share from clients operating in these industries by continuing to focus on asset optimization and sustaining capital projects smallcap projects and maintenancedriven work for our clients in addition we expect the skm acquisition to expand our capabilities beyond nonferrous metals to iron ore and coal and to bring together our existing hydrometallurgy and concentrator skills with skms strength in materials handling and infrastructure 

revenues from clients operating in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets decreased   708 million  or 135  from 5235 million  for fiscal 2013  to 4527 million  for fiscal 2014  the decrease in revenues were due primarily to the normal winddown and completion of projects including work on several vaccine plants located in north america although revenues from clients operating in these industries have declined over the preceding three fiscal years we have seen a recent increase in new project awards as well as indications from certain clients of increasing captial investment we continue to view these industries as improving with prospects in the area of biotechnologybased drug development principally in north america and secondary manufacturing expansion primarily in india and asia 

 the industrial and other category includes projects for clients operating in the pulp  paper hightechnology manufacturing power and food beverage  consumer products industries revenues in this category decreased   1417 million  or 158  from 8998 million  for fiscal 2013  to 7580 million  for fiscal 2014  the decrease  in industrial and other revenues were due primarily to decreased  activity in the pulp  paper market in the us and the hightechnology manufacturing market in ireland 

direct costs of contracts increased   6453 million  or 65  from 998 billion  during fiscal 2013  to 1062 billion  during fiscal 2014  direct costs of contracts include all costs incurred in connection with and directly for the benefit of client contracts including depreciation and amortization relating to assets used in connection with providing the services required by client projects the level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors including the amount of passthrough costs we incur during a period on those projects where we are responsible for subcontract labor or thirdparty materials and equipment we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs and we refer to such costs as “passthrough costs” on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not considered passthrough costs and are therefore not reflected in either revenues or costs to the extent that we incur a significant amount of passthrough costs in a period our direct cost of contracts are likely to increase as well 

passthrough costs increased 3300 million  or 126  from 262 billion  during fiscal 2013  to 295 billion  for fiscal 2014  in general passthrough costs are more significant on projects that have a higher content of field services activities pass 

page 43 

through costs are generally incurred at a specific point in the lifecycle of a project and are highly dependent on the needs of our individual clients and the nature of the clients’ projects however because we have hundreds of projects which start at various times within a fiscal year the effect of passthrough costs on the level of direct costs of contracts can vary between fiscal years without there being a fundamental or significant change to the underlying business 

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts were 837  for fiscal 2014  compared to 844  for fiscal 2013  the relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided generally speaking the more procurement we do on behalf of our clients ie where we purchase equipment and materials for use on projects andor procure subcontracts in connection with projects and the more field services revenues we have relative to technical professional services revenues the higher the ratio will be of direct costs of contracts to revenues because revenues from passthrough costs typically have lower margin rates associated with them it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in such revenues without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit the ratio of direct costs of contracts to revenues over the prior year period decreased  primarily as a result of higher margins in both professional technical services and field services activities and the acquisition of skm 

selling general and administrative sga expenses for fiscal 2014   increased  by 3724 million  or 317  to 155 billion  compared to 117 billion  for fiscal 2013  the increase  in sga expenses reflects the effects of the 2014 restructuring discussed above as well as the results of operations of skm also included in sga expenses for the current fiscal year are transactionrelated expenses incurred in connection with the skm acquisition of 92 million  also included in sga expenses for fiscal 2014 are due diligence and other transactionrelated costs incurred in connection with other mergers and acquisition activity 

net interest expense for fiscal 2014   decreased   58 million  to 17 million  from 75 million  in fiscal 2013  the decrease  is related to the reassessment during fiscal 2014  of a tax matter involving one of our international subsidiaries which resulted in the reversal of 81 million of accrued interest offset in part by the net impacts of the skm acquisition 

the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate was 351  for fiscal 2014  compared to 335  in fiscal 2013  contributing to the increase as compared to the prior year was the effect of the 2014 restructuring also contributing to the higher effective tax rate is the stamp duty paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 related to the skm acquisition 

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 

we recorded net earnings of 4231 million or 323 per diluted share for the fiscal year ended september 27 2013 compared to 3790 million or 294 per diluted share for the fiscal year ended september 28 2012 

revenues increased 9246 million or 85 from 109 billion for fiscal 2012 to 118 billion for fiscal 2013 

revenues from clients operating in the chemicals and polymers industries increased 6864 million or 403 from 17 billion for fiscal 2012 to 24 billion for fiscal 2013 the effect of shale gas projects and the low price of natural gas influenced activity in the chemicals market in fiscal 2013 furthermore our clients were looking at various options to monetize natural gas this increased activity occurred primarily in the us and the uk along with smaller increases in the middle east and asia 

revenues from clients operating in the refining—downstream market decreased 424 million or 18 from 238 billion for fiscal 2012 to 234 billion for fiscal 2013 included in revenues for fiscal 2012 were a significant amount of passthrough costs for a large us based project that was winding down during fiscal 2012 notwithstanding these decreases we had strong sales in this market during fiscal 2013 several downstream companies have announced large capital projects and the industry is beginning to focus on compliance with the epa tier 3 ultra low sulfur gasoline regulations where we believe we are well positioned to support our clients with the required facility modifications 

national government programs revenues for fiscal 2013 remained relatively flat compared to fiscal 2012 uncertainties over us government budget issues and ongoing sequestration concerns remained a primary driver limiting our growth in this market these actions had little effect on the companys projects in backlog in this market during fiscal 2013 we believe that sequestration slowed the release of new project opportunities in this market nevertheless we had significant aerospace and defense awards in this market during fiscal 2013 in addition certain changes in government contracting in the us helped to stabilize this area of our business we saw an increasing volume of work released by us government agencies in the form of 

page 44 

multiple award task order contracts matoc these types of awards allow the company to bid on and participate in more government sites than large singleaward contracts 

revenues from clients operating in the infrastructure market decreased 698 million or 64 from 109 billion for fiscal 2012 to 102 billion for fiscal 2013 we had significant wins in the us market in fiscal 2013 the partial us federal government shutdown added some uncertainty to our us infrastructure market though we experienced little shortterm disruption 

revenues from clients operating in the oil and gas—upstream market increased 1249 million or 158 from 7905 million for fiscal 2012 to 9155 million for fiscal 2013 these increases were primarily a result of improvement in the canadian oil and gas business particularly in field services we saw more opportunities in the middle east including unconventional gas development programs and large pipeline feed projects onshore development and production in the us continued to be strong the australian market was being driven by the development of liquefied natural gas export projects 

revenues from clients operating in the buildings market decreased 1055 million or 125 from 8440 million for fiscal 2012 to 7384 million for fiscal 2013 the state of the us economy impacted this market our buildings business continued to shift towards projects for clients in the private sector opportunities in the private sector business came from mission critical education healthcare aviation and corporate and commercial programs and projects 

revenues from clients operating in the mining and minerals market increased 1622 million or 295 from 5501 million for fiscal 2012 to 7123 million for fiscal 2013 generally our clients in this market were affected negatively by a general slowdown in the rate of growth in the chinese economy falling spot prices for iron ore coking and thermal coal and weaker commodity prices  albeit these declines occurred from prices that were generally high from a historical perspective these trends resulted in clients reducing their capital spending in the mining and minerals market despite this cooling market we were able to capture additional market share during fiscal 2013 the increase in revenues in this market in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily from projects based out of the us 

revenues from clients operating in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets decreased 528 million or 92 from 5763 million for fiscal 2012 to 5235 million for fiscal 2013 though several of our customers delayed projects this market was fairly stable for us in fiscal 2013 

revenues from clients operating in the industrial and other markets increased 2096 million or 304 from 6901 million for fiscal 2012 to 8998 million for fiscal 2013 the increases in industrial and other revenues were due primarily to increased activity in the pulp  paper market in the us and the hightechnology manufacturing market in ireland 

direct costs of contracts increased 8093 million or 88 from 917 billion during fiscal 2012 to 998 billion during fiscal 2013 passthrough costs increased 2964 million or 127 from 233 billion during fiscal 2012 to 262 billion for fiscal 2013 

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts were 844 for fiscal 2013 compared to 841 for fiscal 2012 the increase in the ratio of direct costs of contracts to revenues in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was due primarily to a slight decrease in margins for our professional services offset by improved margins for our field services 

sga expenses for fiscal 2013 increased by 424 million or 38 to 117 billion compared to 113 billion for fiscal 2012 the increase in sga is primarily reflective of the companys increased business activity when compared to fiscal 2012 as a percentage of revenues sga costs declined for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 

interest expense for fiscal 2013 increased 12 million to 129 million from 117 million in fiscal 2012 interest expense in both fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 was due primarily to the debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of the aker entities the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2013 when compared to fiscal 2012 is related primarily to the accrual of interest related to a potential tax liability from an acquisition completed in fiscal 2012 

the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate was 335 for fiscal 2013 compared to 341 in fiscal 2012 the companys lower effective income tax rate in fiscal 2013 when compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2012 was due primarily to an increase in income attributable to noncontrolling interests

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth certain information about our contractual obligations as of september 26 2014 in thousands 

  

  

 page 46 

backlog 

backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us with respect to om contracts however we include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for only one succeeding year regardless of the remaining life of the contract for national government programs other than us federal om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding option periods 

the following table summarizes our backlog for each of the last three fiscal years in millions   



the entire value of contract awards are added to backlog when the contracts are awarded to us accordingly backlog can fluctuate from one reporting period to the next due to the timing of when new contracts are added to backlog and when the contract revenue is recognized in our consolidated financial statements many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years our backlog at september 26 2014   increased  by 12 billion  or 67  to 184 billion  from 172 billion  at september 27 2013  the increase  in backlog from september 27 2013  to september 26 2014  was due primarily to the acquisitions of skm and fns combined with new awards from clients operating in the refiningdownstream infrastructure and chemicals and polymers industry groups and markets among others 

in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client in a situation where a client terminates a contract we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and in certain instances we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs there were no significant project cancellations in fiscal 2014  

while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein accordingly backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenues 

  

backlog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies totaled approximately 48 billion  or 261  of total backlog 41 billion  or 239  of total backlog and 36 billion  or 229  of total backlog at september 26 2014  september 27 2013  and september 28 2012  respectively most of our federal contracts require that services be provided beyond one year in general these contracts must be funded annually ie the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the us congress to the procuring agency and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts 

subject to the factors discussed in item 1a— risk factors  above we estimate that approximately 91 billion  or 493  of total backlog at september 26 2014  will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year 

effects of inflation 

the effects of inflation on our business is discussed in item 1a— risk factors  and is incorporated herein by reference 

liquidity and capital resources 

at september 26 2014  our primary sources of liquidity consisted of 07 billion  of cash and cash equivalents and 08 billion  of available borrowing capacity under our 160 billion  revolving credit facility the 2014 facility additional information regarding the 2014 facility is set forth in note 5  borrowings  in notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k we finance as much of our operations and growth as possible through cash generated by our operations 

during fiscal 2014  our cash and cash equivalents decreased  by 05 billion  from 126 billion  at september 27 2013  to 07 billion  at september 26 2014  this compares to a net increase  in cash and cash equivalents of 2239 million  during the corresponding period last year during fiscal 2014  we experienced net cash inflows  of 7217 million  from operating activities 

page 47 

and 3049 million  from financing activities these cash inflows  were offset by cash outflows  of 15188 million  from investing activities and 316 million  from the effects of exchange rate changes 

operations provided  net cash of 7217 million  during fiscal 2014  this compares to net cash inflows  of 4485 million  and 2998 million  during fiscal 2013  and 2012  respectively the 2732 million  increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal 2014  as compared to fiscal 2013  was due primarily to a 3275 million  favorable change in the companys working capital accounts partially offset by a 881 million   decrease  in net earnings attributable to the group and a 285 million  change related to the companys defined benefit pension plans 

because such a high percentage of our revenues are earned on costplus type contracts and due to the significance of revenues relating to passthrough costs most of the costs we incur are included in invoices we send to clients although we continually monitor our accounts receivable we manage the operating cash flows of the company by managing the working capital accounts in total rather than by the individual elements the primary elements of the company’s working capital accounts are accounts receivable accounts payable and billings in excess of cost accounts payable consists of obligations to third parties relating primarily to costs incurred for projects which are generally billable to clients accounts receivable consist of billings to our clients — a substantial portion of which is for projectrelated costs billings in excess of cost consist of billings to and payments from our clients for costs yet to be incurred 

this relationship between revenues and costs and between receivables and payables is unique to our industry and facilitates review of our liquidity at the total working capital level the changes in cash flows relating to our working capital accounts were due simply to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts and is not indicative of any known trend or fundamental change to the underlying business we still continue to experience delays in certain payments and have seen an increase in the length of payment terms with certain customers we believe that this situation does not present a significant risk to the companys cash flows we believe the risk of not collecting substantially all of the companys outstanding receivables is remote though the company provides services in a number of countries outside the us we believe our credit risk is not significant our private sector customers are comprised principally of large well known and well established multinational companies our government customers are comprised of national state and local agencies located principally in the us and the uk we have not historically experienced significant collection issues with either of our governmental or nongovernmental customers 

  

we used   15 billion  of cash and cash equivalents for investing activities during fiscal 2014  this compares to 1571 million  and 1811 million  during fiscal 2013  and 2012  respectively this increase was primarily the result of the companys acquisition of skm for 12 billion 11 billion net of cash acquired in fiscal 2014  and compares to minimal acquisition activity in fiscal 2013 and 2012 

additions to property and equipment totaled 1321 million  1273 million  and 1026 million  for fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively included in fiscal 2014  and 2013  activity are significant expenditures for leasehold improvements relating primarily to the consolidation of certain office space expansion of office space and relocations of certain office space all occurring in a number of locations 

our financing activities resulted in net cash inflows  of 3049 million  during 2014  as compared to net cash outflows  of 597 million  and 27 million  during fiscal 2014  and 2013  respectively in connection with our acquisition of skm we borrowed 6000 million under our prior facility the 2012 facility see note 5  borrowings  in notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k amounts borrowed to complete the skm acquisition that were still outstanding on the date we closed the 2014 facility were paidoff and reborrowed under the 2014 facility on august 19 2014 the board of directors approved a program to repurchase up to 500 million of the companys common stock over the next three years under the program’s terms shares may be repurchased from time to time at the our discretion on the open market through block trades or otherwise the timing of our share repurchases will depend upon market conditions other uses of capital and other factors 

    the company had 07 billion  of cash and short term equivalents at september 26 2014  of this amount approximately 2633 million  was held in the us and 4693 million  was held outside of the us primarily in canada the uk and the eurozone other than the tax cost of repatriating funds held outside the us to the us see note 9— income taxes  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k there are no impediments to repatriating these funds to the us 

the total amount utilized under the 2014 facility at september 26 2014  was 7669 million   7641 million  in the form of direct borrowings and 28 million  utilized in the form of letters of credit please refer to note 5— borrowings of 

page 48 

notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding the 2012 facility and the 2014 facility 

we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations support our acquisition strategy and service our debt for the next twelve months we had 07 billion  in cash and cash equivalents at september 26 2014  compared to 126 billion  at september 27 2013  our consolidated working capital position at september 26 2014  was 15 billion  a decrease  of 6097 million  from september 27 2013  

additionally there was 08 billion  of borrowing capacity available at september 26 2014  under the 2014 facility we believe that the remaining capacity terms and conditions of our revolving credit facility combined with cash onhand and the other committed and uncommitted facilities we have in place are adequate for our working capital and general business requirements 

the company had 3154 million  of letters of credit outstanding at september 26 2014  of this amount 28 million   were issued under the 2014 facility and 3126 million  were issued under separate committed and uncommitted letterofcredit facilities 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are party to financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk in the form of guarantees not reflected in our balance sheet that arise in the normal course of business however such offbalance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or resources that is material to investors see note 10 – commitments and contingencies and derivative financial instruments  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k

limitations on effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its system of internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed or operated can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of internal control are met the design of the company’s control system reflects the fact that there are resource constraints and that the benefits of such control system must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control failures and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the intentional acts of individuals by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that the design of any particular control will always succeed in achieving its objective under all potential future conditions

general background information 

we are one of the largest technical professional services firms in the world we provide a diverse range of technical professional and construction services to a large number of industrial commercial and governmental clients we provide four broad categories of services 

 we focus our services on clients operating in the following industries and markets 

 we are headquartered in pasadena california usa and provide our services through more than 200 offices located around the globe primarily in north america south america europe the middle east india australia africa and asia 

page 3 

how we operate 

the relationships we have with our clients drive our business as a broadbased technical professional services firm we offer a range of services to help our clients maintain a competitive edge in their respective markets from feasibility studies to design to engineering to construction to startup and commissioning and then to operations and maintenance we customize our services to meet business and project goals our global network of professionals works with a multioffice approach in an effort to provide clients with the best most economical project or program solutions 

we strive to provide client value through continuous improvement in our performance we regularly monitor our clients expectations our quality system and our operational performance tools such as our jacobs value enhancing practices global standard operating procedures project reviews the jacobs system to ensure project success jsteps and safe plans of action spas provide added value to our clients projects they also allow us to create performance improvement actions during the project execution through continuous improvement upon our performance our tools and our processes we believe we can offer our clients superior value when they do business with us 

jacobsvalue sm value plus is an internal tool we use to document and quantify the actual value or savings we provide to our clients and their projects some of the benefits achieved through the value plus program include lower total installed cost shorter schedule and reduced life cycle cost value plus is implemented at project initiation a project goal is created and costsaving ideas are entered into the value plus database when the value plus cycle is complete the project team and client identify unique cost andor schedule reductions for the project 

our business model 

our organizational structure and integrated system for delivering services are key components of our business strategy our operating units generally use a matrix organizational structure whereby our project management functions are supported by the various technical planning design and construction disciplines that are necessary to effectively execute longterm engineering and construction contracts we recognize that technical expertise alone cannot grow our business project management skills and the ability to manage multimillion dollar projects and programs for our clients is critical to our success crucial functions such as project controls and procurement are embedded within each of our major offices and serve operations by providing specialized services required by projects 

jacobs’ business is set up to foster cooperation among teams we do not maintain “profit centers” within the company nor do the operating groups compete against each other for contracts our organizational structure and integrated system for delivering services are key components of our business strategy the following three ideas support our business model 

multidomestic approach 

we work in many countries with locally staffed offices that share a common set of values and a single vision while maintaining oneonone contact with individual clients this multidomestic approach enables us to provide customized service suited to the locale while still taking advantage of the company’s global network 

boundaryless approach 

our diversity encompasses our people geographic reach expertise and technical capabilities on projects around the world we enhance local expertise with the brightest talent and the best technology available anywhere throughout the company this seamless boundaryless approach keeps us flexible and enhances our ability to develop the best possible solutions for our clients regardless of office or project location 

cost management approach 

as the global economy expands and companies providing technical professional and construction services are required to compete against each other across geographic boundaries the company that can provide its clients with costefficient solutions to their project needs has the advantage with a relentless focus on managing costs we provide savings to clients and deliver superior technical professional and construction services safely efficiently and within the cost and time parameters our clients require 

jacobs’ corporate functions include quality and safety finance and administration legal compliance communications global sales and marketing human resources and information technology departments that are integral to our success 

page 4 

the companys culture 

our employees are our most important and valuable asset and therefore the prevention of jobrelated injuries is given top priority it is the policy of the company to provide and maintain a safe and healthy working environment and to follow operating practices that safeguard all employees and result in a more efficient operation 

beyondzero®  the name of our program that promotes our culture of caring moves beyond efforts to have an incident and injuryfree safety performance we implement a true culture of caring where concern for employees health safety and welfare extends outside the office walls beyond the project site fences and into their homes cars and all the places where they interact with family friends and fellow employees it actively involves employees in championing the safety and wellness of themselves and others  encouraging every employee to have the courage to take action and positively influence the intentions and behaviors of those around them with the belief that the safety and wellness of employees are integrally linked to sound business performance and efficiency in project execution 

since jacobs’ founding the company has been based on doing business honestly ethically and with the utmost integrity our culture and our code of conduct that is signed annually by all employees prescribes that everyone at the company must adhere to jacobs’ core values and ethical code and comply with the laws that govern the company’s activities worldwide our employees and business partners are expected to follow the highest principles of business conduct integrity and ethics as they carry out their responsibilities and are guided by the following principles in carrying out their responsibilities loyalty compliance with applicable laws observance of ethical standards avoidance of conflicts of interest and communication we endeavor to deal fairly with our employees customers suppliers and competitors and to respect the policies and procedures of those outside the company 

our objective is to present a clear and consistent image of our company to our clients employees shareholders and business partners  regarding how we behave how we communicate how we look and most importantly how our promises to our clients are delivered  anywhere in the world 

we accomplish this foremost through our core values which allow us to behave as one company and unify us worldwide by keeping our core values as a central focus of our company we are able to think the same way and arrive at similar conclusions regardless of our physical location our core values are 

 the balance inherent in our core values is also evident in our approach to sustainability which maintains an even balance between the people the economics and the environmental aspects of business jacobs is driven to continuously improve efficiencies and reduce energy and resources practices that drive down costs and contribute to a lower impact on the environment the company adheres to the following seven sus tainability principles 

 

applying the best most efficient and effective sustainable solutions for clients worldwide in all major industries where we operate allows us to make a significant contribution to a safe and sustainable future each year we issue a sustainability report  that describes many of our efforts and accomplishments regarding environmental sustainability 

with respect to human resources our goal is to establish an inclusive diverse workplace that energizes the people who fuel our companys growth although we are a large company with over 66000 employees in more than 25 countries our employees are unified in their focus on superior value safety and ethical business practices regardless of the country 

our work locations around the world are multicultural and our people are successful at building networks breaking down boundaries and embracing diversity they collaborate and learn new skills from one another jacobs’ regional 

page 5 

management is committed to nurturing and developing employees so they have rewarding and challenging careers and are engaged in the business employees frequently move around the system as they grow their careers and serve clients so everyone at jacobs is urged to operate with a boundaryless mindset connecting across geographies disciplines and industries to collaborate on innovative solutions that provide maximum value to clients 

we recognize that an inclusive environment is a healthy one that results in better decisions better talent and more creative solutions to offer our clients we have engaged committed and productive people who add value to our project teams we focus on hiring the best keeping the best and continually improving the skills and capabilities of individuals and teams 

how we grow 

jacobs has grown significantly since its founding in 1947 both through organic growth and through strategic acquisition an important part of the company’s growth strategy we have successfully acquired and integrated numerous companies over the years that have enhanced our capabilities geographic reach and offerings 

in terms of organic growth our relationshipbased business model is central to our sustained growth and profitability we pursue the development of longterm relationships and alliances with our clients by working with our clients on their capital programs we increase our understanding of their overall business needs as well as the unique technical requirements of their specific projects this increased understanding enables us we believe to provide superior value to our clients our approach provides us with opportunities to market all the services our clients are expected to need in the predesign phase such as master planning permitting or project finance options in the design phase and in the construction poststartup and commissioning phases of a facility including operations and maintenance services 

our relationships with clients also present ongoing opportunities to expand into adjacent markets for example clients operating in the mining and minerals market often have a need for our infrastructure and buildings capabilities the same is true for clients operating in other markets 

we market our services to clients in a wide range of public and institutional process and industrial markets we increase our opportunities through selective market diversity and are able to price contracts more competitively and enhance overall profitability while delivering additional value to our clients by integrating and bundling our services in complex economic times we have the ability to evolve along with market cycles worldwide when opportunities decrease in a particular market or geography other opportunities often increase because of our selective market diversity we believe we are wellpositioned to address a wide range of opportunities across many markets and geographies which helps us grow our business 

closely linked to our relationshipbased business model is our multidomestic geographic strategy our core clients can depend on us for assistance with their engineering and construction needs when they move projects around the world we therefore follow our clients into new geographic regions which helps us perform meaningful portions of their projects by utilizing local resources rather than exporting the work to other offices 

the role of acquisitions in the development our business 

when we review acquisition targets we are conscious of the effect the acquisition may have on our client base we favor acquisitions that allow us to i expand into a new client market ii enhance the range of services we provide existing clients andor iii access new geographic areas in which our clients either already operate or plan to expand by expanding into new geographic areas and adding to our existing technical and project management capabilities we strive to position ourselves as a preferred singlesource provider of technical professional and construction services to our major clients the following is a brief description of some of our recent key acquisitions 

 page 6 

 page 7 

after we complete an acquisition we generally move very quickly to integrate the newlyacquired operations we typically assign senior operations personnel to manage the overall integration process with assistance from our sales accounting legal it human resources and risk management departments although integrating newly acquired businesses can be very challenging the assimilation process is critical in order to assure i that our global businesses processes and systems are properly deployed throughout the newlyacquired entities and ii that we can begin to leverageoff the acquired talents skills and expertise to grow our business and help our clients execute their capital programs newlyacquired businesses are generally not left as standalone entities within the company’s internal reporting system the businesses we acquire are typically folded in to existing operational organizations within the company for additional information regarding certain issues related to our acquisition strategy please refer to item 1a— r isk factors below 

financial information about segments 

although we describe our business in this annual report on form 10k in terms of the various services we provide the markets in which our clients operate and the geographic areas in which we operate we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment pursuant to those accounting principles generally accepted in the us “us gaap” in making this determination we considered the various economic characteristics of our operations including the nature of the services we provide the nature of our internal processes for delivering and distributing those services and the types of customers we have in addition to the discussion that follows please refer to note 14 — segment information  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

there is a high degree of similarity among the workforces employed across the categories of services we provide for example professionals in engineering and design services ie services provided by persons who are degreed and in certain circumstances licensed such as engineers architects scientists and economists exist in all four service categories in addition there is a high degree of similarity among a significant component of the workforces we employ to perform construction and operations and maintenance om projects in providing construction and om services we employ a large number of skilled craft labor personnel these may include welders pipe fitters electricians crane operators and other personnel who work on very large capital projects in the case of projects classified within the construction services category or on smaller capital projects in the case of maintenance projects classified within the om services category 

all of our offices use a matrix organizational structure our results therefore are dependent on groups representing technical disciplines eg electrical engineering mechanical engineering cost engineering etc supporting project management personnel who maintain the relationship between our clients and us and are ultimately responsible for delivering projects to our clients safely on time and on budget additionally all of our operating regions use common tools policies and procedures to manage and run their respective units these include project review meetings project performance evaluations and project execution plans 

  

each of the companys operating regions provides most of the services the company offers generally and each of our operating regions includes in its customer base many of the same or similar clients as our other regions 

the use of technology throughout our organization is highly uniform whether it is computeraided design and drafting “cadd” applications used by our engineering and design staff or modeling programs used by the scientific and consulting staff or scheduling estimating and cost control applications used by homeoffice personnel in support of our construction and maintenance activities all of the service categories described above are equally affected by changes in technology as they occur in the economy at large 

furthermore the types of information and internal reports used by the company’s chief operating decision maker the “codm” who is also the company’s chief executive officer and other members of management to monitor performance evaluate results of operations allocate resources and otherwise manage the business support a single reportable segment accordingly based on these similarities we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment for purposes of the disclosures included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

page 8 

services provided 

as described above the services we provide generally fall into the following four broad categories project services process scientific and systems consulting services construction services and operations and maintenance services 

the following table sets forth our revenues from each of our four service categories for each of the last five fiscal years in thousands 



project services 

we employ the engineering architecture interiors design planning and related disciplines necessary to design and engineer modern process plants buildings infrastructure projects technology and manufacturing facilities consumer products manufacturing facilities power plants and stations pulp and paper plants and other facilities 

we are capable of providing our clients with a variety of value engineering services including safety in design through safety in design we integrate best practices hazard analysis and risk assessment methods early in the design phase of projects taking those steps necessary to eliminate or mitigate injury and damage during the construction startup testing and commissioning and operations phases of a project 

in the area of construction management we provide our clients with a wide range of services as an agent for our clients we may act as program director whereby we oversee on the owners behalf the complete planning design and construction phases of the project alternatively our services may be limited to providing construction consulting 

project services also includes planning scheduling procurement estimating cost engineering project accounting quality and safety and all other key support services needed for complete cradletograve project delivery 

process scientific and systems consulting services 

we employ the professional and technical skills and expertise with respect to a broad range of consulting services including performing pricing studies market analyses and financial projections necessary in determining the feasibility of a project performing gasoline reformulation modeling analyzing and evaluating layout and mechanical designs for complex processing plants analyzing automation and control systems analyzing designing and executing biocontainment strategies developing and performing process protocols with respect to the us food and drug administrationmandated qualification and validation requirements and performing geological and metallurgical studies 

also included in this service category are revenues relating to defense and aerospacerelated programs such services typically are more technical and scientific in nature than other project services we provide and may involve such tasks as supporting the development and testing of conventional weapons systems weapons modeling and simulations computer systems development maintenance and support evaluation and testing of missioncritical control systems aerospace testing and propulsion systems and facilities and other highly technical or scientific tasks 

construction services 

in addition to the construction management services included under project services above we provide traditional field construction services to private and public sector clients we also provide our clients with a modular construction option our modular construction includes the engineering and construction of a facility in an offsite fabrication and assembly environment with final completion during the field erection phase the option provides our clients with an alternative approach to traditional methods of engineering and construction which can compress and shorten the construction schedule reduce risk lower costs and provide environmental benefits in the area of environmental remediation and restoration we also provide environmental remedial construction services for a variety of public and private sector clients 

page 9 

historically our field construction activities have been focused primarily on those construction projects for which we perform much of the related engineering and design work by focusing our construction efforts in this way we minimize the risks associated with constructing complex projects based on designs prepared by third parties the financial risk to us of constructing complex assets based on designs prepared by third parties may be particularly significant on fixedprice contracts therefore we generally avoid this type of project however we will pursue constructiononly projects when we can negotiate pricing and other contract terms we deem acceptable and which we believe can result in a fair return for the degree of risk we assume 

operations and maintenance om services 

om refers to all of the tasks required to operate and maintain large complex facilities on behalf of clients we provide key management and support services over all aspects of the operations of a facility including managing subcontractors and other onsite personnel om also includes process plant maintenance services which generally involves all tasks required to keep a process plant typically a refinery or chemical plant in daytoday operation 

within the aerospace and defense areas om often requires us to provide the management and technical support services necessary to operate and maintain such sites as engine test facilities weapons integration facilities and hightech simulation and verification centers such om contracts also frequently require us to provide facilities management and maintenance services utilities operations and maintenance services property management and disposition services and construction support services 

within the environmental area om often includes engineering and technical support services as well as program management services necessary to remediate contaminated sites 

although the gross profit margins we realize from om services are generally lower than those associated with the other services we provide the costs to support maintenance activities are also generally lower also om services offer us an opportunity for longterm relationships with clients this aspect of om services greatly reduces the selling costs in respect of such services

backlog 

backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us with respect to om contracts however we include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for only one succeeding year regardless of the remaining life of the contract for national government programs other than us federal om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding option periods in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation termination or suspension at the discretion of the client in addition the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts accordingly backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings 

our backlog includes expected revenues for contracts that are based on estimates for information regarding our backlog including those risk factors specific to backlog please refer to item 1a — risk factors  and item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  below 

significant customers 

the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government for each of the last five fiscal years   



it is uncommon for a commercial customer to contribute 10 or more of the company’s total revenues on occasion however we will perform a number of field services projects for a single customer in the same fiscal year which primarily because of the amount of passthrough costs discussed below that is included in revenue will cause total revenue from that customer to exceed 10 of total consolidated revenues for the fiscal year ended october 2 2009 revenues earned from motiva enterprises llc accounted for 122 of total consolidated revenues 

financial information about geographic areas 

selected financial information regarding the geographic areas in which we operate is included in note 14 — segment information  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k and is incorporated herein by reference

contracts 

while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake our contracts generally fall into two broad categories costreimbursable and fixedprice the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the last five fiscal years 

  



in accordance with industry practice most of our contracts including those with the us federal government are subject to termination at the discretion of the client which is discussed in greater detail in item 1a — risk factors in such situations our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination 

when we are directly responsible for engineering design procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client’s plant or facility we reflect the costs of materials equipment and subcontracts in both revenues and costs on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs the following table sets forth the approximate amount of such passthrough costs included in revenues for each of the last five fiscal years in millions of dollars 

  



costreimbursable contracts 

costreimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit the profit element may be in the form of a simple markup applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee or a combination of a markup and a fee the fee element can also take several forms the fee may be a fixed amount it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred or it may be an incentive fee based on targets milestones or performance factors defined in the contract in general we prefer costreimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price 

fixedprice contracts 

fixedprice contracts include both “lump sum bid” contracts and “negotiated fixedprice” contracts under lump sum bid contracts we typically bid against other contractors based on specifications the client furnishes this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period additionally it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients which is contrary to our relationshipbased business model accordingly lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract in contrast under a negotiated fixedprice contract we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client negotiated fixedprice contracts frequently exist in singleresponsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project thus although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us however because of economies that may be realized during the contract term both negotiated fixedprice and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts over the past five years most of our fixedprice work has been either negotiated fixedprice contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services rather than turnkey construction

 item 1a risk factors 

we operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future we may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial if any such events actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces if we fail to maintain safe work sites we can be exposed to significant financial losses as well as civil and criminal liabilities 

construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment moving vehicles chemical and manufacturing processes and highly regulated materials on many sites we are responsible for safety and accordingly must implement safety procedures if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective our employees and others may become injured unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover increase the cost of a project to our clients and raise our operating costs any of the foregoing could result in financial losses which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials which if improperly handled or disposed of could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health safety and environmental “hse” work procedures throughout our organization including construction sites and maintenance sites the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability 

our safety record is critical to our reputation many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures as a result our failure to maintain adequate safety standards could result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our project execution activities may result in liability for faulty engineering services   

our failure to make judgments and recommendations in accordance with applicable professional standards could result in large damages our engineering practice for example involves professional judgments regarding the planning design development construction operations and management of industrial facilities and public infrastructure projects while we do not generally accept liability for consequential damages and although we have adopted a range of insurance risk management and risk avoidance programs designed to reduce potential liabilities a catastrophic event at one of our project sites or completed projects resulting from the services we have performed could result in significant professional or product liability warranty or other claims against us as well as reputational harm especially if public safety is impacted these liabilities could exceed our insurance limits or the fees we generate or could impact our ability to obtain insurance in the future in addition clients or subcontractors who have agreed to indemnify us against any such liabilities or losses might refuse or be unable to pay us an uninsured claim either in part or in whole if successful and of a material magnitude could have a substantial impact on our operations 

the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are a party to litigation in the normal course of business since we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities and projects where design construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or others we are exposed to substantial claims and litigation if there is a failure at any such project such claims could relate to among other things personal injury loss of life business interruption property damage pollution and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties such as those who use or reside near our clients’ projects we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met in many of our contracts with clients subcontractors and vendors we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages penalties losses and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts in addition while clients and subcontractors may agree to indemnify us against certain liabilities such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us 

page 18 

we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations our insurance programs have varying coverage limits and maximums and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make in addition we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under these programs as a result we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured our insurers are also subject to business risk and as a result one or more of them may be unable to fulfill their insurance obligations due to insolvency or otherwise 

in addition the nature of our business sometimes results in clients subcontractors and vendors presenting claims to us for among other things recovery of costs related to certain projects similarly we occasionally present change orders and other claims to our clients subcontractors and vendors if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients subcontractors and vendors we could incur cost overruns reduced profits or in some cases a loss for a project a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results additionally irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant 

litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability product liability criminal liability warranty obligations and other liabilities which to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we bear the risk of cost overruns in fixedprice contracts we may experience reduced profits or in some cases losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates 

for fiscal 2013  approximately 150  of our revenues were earned under contracts that were fixedprice in nature for these contracts we bear the risk of paying some if not all of any cost overruns fixedprice contract amounts are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions including those about future economic conditions prices and availability of labor equipment and materials and other exigencies if these estimates prove inaccurate there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications or if circumstances change due to among other things unanticipated technical problems difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals changes in local laws or labor conditions weather delays changes in the costs of raw materials or our vendors’ or subcontractors’ inability to perform then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or in some cases a loss for that project if the project is significant or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our vulnerability to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our clients operate is exacerbated during economic downturns or time of political uncertainty 

we provide technical professional construction and om services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration production and refining programs for various national governments including the us federal government chemicals and polymers mining and minerals pharmaceuticals and biotechnology infrastructure buildings power and other general industrial and consumer businesses and markets such as technology and manufacturing pulp and paper and food and consumer products these markets and the resulting demand for our services have been and we expect will continue to be cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control including economic conditions and changes in client spending particularly during periods of economic or political uncertainty 

current global economic and political conditions have negatively impacted many of our clients’ ability and willingness to fund their projects they have also caused our clients to reduce their capital expenditures alter the mix of services purchased seek more favorable price and other contract terms and otherwise slow their spending on our services for example in the public sector declines in state tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending in addition due to these conditions many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable these conditions have reduced the demand for our services which has had a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations 

current economic conditions also make it extremely difficult for our clients our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could cause businesses to continue to slow spending on our services we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery worldwide or in our clients’ markets in addition our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and therefore may not 

page 19 

recover as quickly as the economy at large a continuation or worsening of current weak economic conditions or a reduction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

regardless of economic or market conditions investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients’ markets and investment decisions as a result our past results have varied and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate 

fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers’ investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation delays in existing work or changes in the timing and funding of new awards 

commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways for example for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil gas copper or fertilizers fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and therefore their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments to the extent commodity prices decline and our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects the demand for our services decreases which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned as well as those in progress and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel 

the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel including engineers architects designers craft personnel and corporate management professionals who have the required experience and expertise from time to time it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients in certain geographic areas for example we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel 

in addition as some of our key personnel approach retirement age we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the cost of providing our services including the extent to which we utilize our workforce affects our profitability for example the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts if an expected contract award is delayed or not received we could incur costs resulting from excess staff reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business financial conditions and results of operations 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies which are a significant source of our revenue and profit are subject to various uncertainties restrictions and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities as well as cost controls government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding such as sequestration contracts with the us federal government for example are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for government programs may even be eliminated 

as a result our government clients may reduce the scope or terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues for example those with the us federal government represented approximately 199  of our total revenue in fiscal 2013  a significant reduction in government funding or the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

page 20 

most government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process the us federal government has increasingly relied upon multipleyear contacts with multiple contractors that generally require those contractors to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under a contract this process may result in us facing significant additional pricing pressure and uncertainty and incurring additional costs moreover we may not be awarded government contracts because of existing policies designed to protect small businesses and underrepresented minorities our inability to win new contracts or be awarded work under existing contracts could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 

in addition government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socioeconomic requirements which affects how we transact business with our clients and in some instances impose additional costs on our business operations for example for contracts with the us federal government we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation the truth in negotiations act the cost accounting standards the service contract act and numerous regulations governing environmental protection and employment practices government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than nongovernment contracts this includes for example unlimited indemnification obligations 

we also are subject to government audits investigations and proceedings for example government agencies such as the us defense contract audit agency routinely review and audit us to determine the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies and whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations these audits can result in a determination that a rule or regulation has been violated or that adjustments are necessary to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies 

if we violate a rule or regulation fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit a variety of penalties can be imposed including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties in addition any or all of our government contracts could be terminated we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work or payment of our costs could be disallowed for example in socalled qui tam actions brought by individuals or the government under the us federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws treble damages can be awarded the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances which can be difficult and time consuming to obtain if our employees are unable to obtain or retain the necessary securities clearances our clients could terminate or not renew existing contracts or award us new contracts to the extent this occurs our operations and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted cancelled or suspended by our clients and therefore our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings additionally even if fully performed our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins 

as of the end of fiscal 2013  our backlog totaled approximately 172 billion  there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or if realized will result in profits in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation termination or suspension at the discretion of the client in addition the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts the revenue for certain contracts included in backlog are based on estimates projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns 

additionally the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence future profitability in some markets there is a continuing trend towards costreimbursable contracts with incentivefee arrangements typically our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs overall safety performance overall client satisfaction and other performance criteria if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards we may receive a lower or even zero incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins accordingly there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog assuming they produce the revenues currently expected will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past 

page 21 

negative conditions in the credit and financial markets and delays in receiving client payments could result in liquidity problems 

although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions in addition some of our clients depend on the availability of credit to help finance their capital projects instability in the credit markets in the us or abroad could cause the availability of credit to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain this situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds refinance our existing indebtedness enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us we may also enter into business acquisition agreements that require us to access credit which if not available at the closing of the acquisition could result in a breach of the acquisition agreement and a resulting claim for damages by the sellers of such business in addition market conditions could negatively impact our clients’ ability to fund their projects and therefore utilize our services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors suppliers and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements on less favorable terms with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are therefore subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices in weak economic environments we may experience increased delays and failures due to among other reasons a diminution in our clients’ access to the credit markets if one or more clients delays in paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

furthermore our cash balances and shortterm investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america europe south america australia and asia some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership or have been seized by their governments there is a risk that this may occur in the future if this were to occur we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund operations 

our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control 

as is common in the industry we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures partnerships and similar arrangements this situation exposes us to a number of risks including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients our partners may also be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships if these circumstances occur we may be required to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages provide additional services or make additional investments to ensure adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services under agreements with joint and several liabilities we could be liable for both our obligations and those of our partners these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner in these cases we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the failure by a joint venture partner to comply with applicable laws regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and for government clients could result in fines penalties suspension or even debarment being imposed on us which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

page 22 

we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts 

much of the work performed under our contracts is performed by thirdparty subcontractors we hire we also rely on thirdparty equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired if we are not able to locate qualified thirdparty subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated especially in a lumpsum or a fixedprice contract we may suffer losses on these contracts if a subcontractor supplier or manufacturer fails to provide services supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason we may be required to source these services equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms which could impact contract profitability in the current economic environment third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party’s ability to provide materials equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a failure by a third party subcontractor supplier or manufacturer to comply with applicable laws regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and for government clients could result in fines penalties suspension or even debarment being imposed on us which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

maintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts 

in line with industry practice we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds to our customers these bonds indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract if a bond is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond we cannot pursue that project 

historically we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity but as is typically the case the issuance of a bond is at the surety’s sole discretion and the issuance of a letter of credit is based on the companys credit worthiness because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms our inability to obtain adequate bonding and as a result to bid on new contracts that require such bonding could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

past and future environmental heath and safety laws could impose significant additional costs and liabilities 

we are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities 

various us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants the liability under these laws is joint and several we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen cleanup obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

when we perform our services our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions we may be subject to liability claims by employees customers and third parties as a result of such exposures in addition we may be subject to fines penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws a claim if not covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

such laws regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could for example relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and in turn could negatively impact our revenue our failure to comply with such laws or regulations whether actual or alleged could expose us to fines penalties or potential litigation liabilities including costs settlements and judgments any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

page 23 

in addition we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments which may require us or our clients to obtain and to comply with federal state and local government permits and approvals any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial revocation or modification under various circumstances failure to obtain or comply with or the loss or modification of the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and result of operations 

if we fail to comply with federal state local or foreign governmental requirements our business may be adversely affected 

we are subject to us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business for example our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders although we have policies and procedures to comply with us and foreign international trade laws the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and could damage our reputation and therefore our ability to do business 

employee agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts which could result in reduced revenues and profits 

misconduct fraud noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or other improper activities by one of our employees agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations regulations regarding the protection of classified information regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts regulations on lobbying or similar activities regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting environmental laws and any other applicable laws or regulations for example we routinely provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters if a security breach were to occur our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective and we could face unknown risks or losses our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act of 2010 and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices despite our training and compliance programs there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the loss of or a significant reduction in business from one or a few customers could have an adverse impact on us 

a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue andor backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years for example in fiscal 2013  2012  and fiscal 2011  approximately 199  221  and 244  respectively of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government although we have longstanding relationships with many of our significant clients our clients may unilaterally reduce delay or cancel their contracts at any time our loss of or a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we engage in a highly competitive business if we are unable to compete effectively we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

we face intense competition to provide technical professional and construction services to clients the extent of such competition varies by industry geographic market and project type for example with respect to our construction and operations and maintenance services clients generally award large projects to large contractors which may give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects conversely with respect to our engineering design architectural 

page 24 

and consulting services low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller newer competitors if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both which if significant could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our larger competitors for engineering construction and maintenance services for process plants include bechtel fluor foster wheeler kbr technip worleyparsons cbi and amec in the area of buildings our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr hok aecom and turner in the area of infrastructure our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as urs parsons brinckerhoff hntb tetra tech parsons and ws atkins in the area of national government programs our principal competitors include several of the competitors listed above as well as leidos ch2m hill weston lockheed martin and computer sciences corporation 

in addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in risk factors our international operations are also exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies 

for fiscal 2013  approximately 408  of our revenues was earned from clients outside the us our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues our international operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

  

 the lack of a welldeveloped legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights in addition military action or continued unrest particularly in the middle east could impact the supply or pricing of oil disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic political and other conditions our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

we work in international locations where there are high security risks which could result in harm to our employees or unanticipated cost 

some of our services are performed in high risk locations where the country or location is subject to political social or economic risks or war or civil unrest in those locations where we have employees or operations we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel despite these activities in these locations we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel and we may suffer future losses of employees and subcontractors 

foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects 

our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects both positive and negative that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar into the us dollar while we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in the currencies of our expenditures we do enter into contracts that expose us to currency risk particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs we attempt to minimize our exposure from currency risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies or entering into derivative 

page 25 

hedging instruments when there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts these actions however may not always eliminate currency risk exposure based on fluctuations in currency the us dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly we may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries 

our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties 

our business strategy involves growth through among other things the acquisition of other companies acquiring companies presents a number of risks including 

 while we often obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses such rights may be difficult to enforce the losses may exceed any dedicated escrow funds and the indemnitors may not have ability to financially support the indemnity 

in addition there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us existing cash balances and cash flow from operations together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities may be insufficient to make acquisitions credit market conditions may also make it more difficult and costly to finance acquisitions acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 

in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make we could dilute share ownership 

one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities accordingly we filed a shelf registration statement on form s4 on december 7 2007 if we issue additional equity securities pursuant to this shelf registration statement or otherwise such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders’ individual ownership percentages in the company 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock because of a number of factors including 

 page 26 

 our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements 

in preparing our financial statements our management is required under us gaap to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities areas requiring significant estimates by our management include 

 our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

an impairment charge of goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

under us gaap we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach as of september 27 2013  we had 20 billion  of goodwill representing 278  of our total assets of 73 billion  we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business potential government actions toward our facilities and other factors 

if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value we could be required to record an impairment charge the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing please see item 7— management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  below 

we may be required to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and postretirement benefit plans we manage 

we have various employee benefit plan obligations that require us to make contributions to satisfy over time our underfunded benefit obligations which are generally determined by calculating the projected benefit obligations minus the fair value of plan assets for example as of september 27 2013  and september 28 2012  our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans were projected to be underfunded by 4025 million  and 4637 million  respectively see note 6— pension plans  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k for additional disclosure in the future our benefit plan obligations may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of 

page 27 

interest rates pension plan asset performance and other factors if we are required to contribute a significant amount of the deficit for underfunded benefit plans our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

rising inflation interest rates andor construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts in particular with respect to our fixedprice contracts 

rising inflation interest rates or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services in addition we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixedprice because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from costreimbursable type contracts approximately 850  during fiscal 2013  the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor however if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixedprice and lumpsum work is more prevalent inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future therefore increases in inflation interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change 

growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations for example there is a growing consensus that new and additional regulations may be enacted concerning among other things greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased compliance costs for us and our clients legislation international protocols regulation or other restrictions on emissions could also affect our clients including those who are involved in the exploration production or refining of fossil fuels such changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or in some cases prevent a project from going forward thereby potentially reducing the need for our services which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations however these changes could also increase the pace of projects such as carbon capture or storage projects that could have a positive impact on our business we cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers 

our effective tax rate may increase or decrease 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation the introduction of new tax accounting standards legislation regulations and related interpretations our global mix of earnings the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

systems and information technology interruption could adversely impact our ability to operate 

we rely heavily on computer information and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business from time to time we experience occasional system interruptions and delays in the event we are unable to regularly deploy software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems the operation of such systems could be interrupted or result in the loss corruption or release of data in addition our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters telecommunications failures acts of war or terrorism computer viruses physical or electronic security breaches intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error or similar events or disruptions any of these or other events could cause interruptions delays loss of critical andor sensitive data or similar effects which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition protection of intellectual property and results of operations as well as those of our clients 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or that of our clients 

our technology and intellectual property provide us in many instances with a competitive advantage although we protect our property through patent registrations license restrictions and similar mechanisms we may not be able to successfully preserve our rights and they could be invalidated circumvented challenged or become obsolete in addition the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the us if we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced in addition our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property there is a risk we 

page 28 

may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and as a result could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities loss of contracts or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control 

extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control such as natural or manmade disasters could negatively impact our ability to operate as an example from time to time we face unexpected severe weather conditions which may result in weatherrelated delays that are not always reimbursable under a fixedprice contract evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services increased labor and material costs in areas resulting from weatherrelated damage and subsequent increased demand for labor and materials for repairing and rebuilding inability to deliver materials equipment and personnel to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules and loss of productivity we may remain obligated to perform our services after any such natural or manmade event unless a force majeure clause or other contractual provision provides us with relief from our contractual obligations if we are not able to react quickly to such events or if a high concentration of our projects are in a specific geographic region that suffers from a natural or manmade catastrophe our operations may be significantly affected which could have a negative impact on our operations in addition if we cannot complete our contracts on time we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients which may reduce our profits 

we are subject to professional standards duties and statutory obligations on professional reports and opinions we issue which could subject us to monetary damages 

we issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional engineering expertise as well as our other professional credentials that subject us to professional standards duties and obligations regulating the performance of our services for example we issue opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings if a client or another third party alleges that our report or opinion is incorrect or it is improperly relied upon and we are held responsible we could be subject to significant monetary damages 

delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control 

we are a delaware corporation certain antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us in addition certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover for example 

 these types of provisions as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders accordingly stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend critical accounting policies 

in order to understand better the changes that occur to key elements of our financial condition results of operations and cash flows a reader of this management’s discussion and analysis “mda” should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business performing longterm engineering and constructiontype contracts requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect both the entity’s results of operations and the carrying values of its assets and liabilities although our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 – significant accounting policies  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k the following discussion is intended to highlight and describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue accounting for contracts and use of joint ventures —in general we recognize revenues at the time we provide services depending on the commercial terms of the contract we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred or using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion this method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress as of the balance sheet dates in making such estimates judgments are required to evaluate the possible effects of variances in schedule the costs of materials and labor productivity and the impact of change orders liability claims contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee for contracts containing incentive fee arrangements fees are frequently based on achievement of target completion dates target costs andor other performance criteria failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or nonrecoverable costs which could exceed revenues recognized from the project 

we provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known without regard to the percentage of completion for multiple contracts with a single customer we account for each contract separately 

the nature of our business sometimes results in clients subcontractors or vendors presenting claims to us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible in those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract we include in the total estimated costs of the contract and therefore the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract an estimate based on all relevant facts and circumstances available of the additional costs to be incurred similarly and in the normal course of business we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible in those situations where we have presented such claims to our clients we include in revenues the amount of costs incurred without profit to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims 

certain costreimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment in this situation revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts in those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs that are not allowable under the terms of the contract we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly 

as is common to the industry we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures and consortiums although the joint ventures own and hold the contracts with the clients the services required by the contracts are typically performed by us and our joint venture partners or by other subcontractors under subcontracting agreements with the joint ventures the assets of our joint ventures therefore consist almost entirely of cash and receivables representing amounts due from clients and the liabilities of our joint ventures consist almost entirely of amounts due to the joint venture partners for services provided by the partners to the joint ventures under their individual subcontracts and other subcontractors in general at any given time the equity of our joint ventures represents the undistributed profits earned on contracts the joint ventures hold with clients very few of our joint ventures have employees none of our joint ventures have thirdparty debt or credit facilities our joint ventures therefore are simply mechanisms used to deliver engineering and construction services to clients rarely do they in and of themselves present any risk of loss to us or to our partners separate 

page 34 

from those that we would carry if we were performing the contract on our own under us gaap our share of losses associated with the contracts held by the joint ventures if and when they occur has always been reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

in evaluating the companys joint ventures also referred to as variable interest entities or vies for accounting and consolidation purposes we perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether or not the company has a “controlling financial interest” in the vie the company is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a vie if it has i the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and ii the right to receive benefits or obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie in making our qualitative analysis the company assesses each vie to determine those activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and whether the company another entity or multiple entities have the power to direct those activities 

  if we determine that we have the power to direct those activities of the vie that most significantly impact its financial performance and have the right or obligation to receive benefits or absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie then we are the primary beneficiary of the vie and we consolidate the vie if we determine that we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the vie or power is shared by two or more unrelated parties then we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not consolidate the vie 

for the companys unconsolidated joint ventures we use either the equity method of accounting or proportional conslidation the company does not currently participate in any significant vies in which it has a controlling financial interest there were no changes in facts and circumstances in the period that caused the company to reassess the method of accounting for its vies 

accounting for stock issued to employees and others — we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the estimated grantdate fair value of the award we estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors using the blackscholes optionpricing model like all optionpricing models the blackscholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions including i the expected volatility of the market price of the underlying stock and ii the expected term of the award among others accordingly changes in assumptions and any subsequent adjustments to those assumptions can cause drastically different fair values to be assigned to our stock option awards for restricted stock units containing service and performance conditions with measures external to the company compensation expense is based on the fair value of such units determined using monte carlo simulations due to the uncertainties inherent in the use of assumptions and the results of applying monte carlo simulations the amount of expense recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the effects on our future consolidated financial statements because equity awards tend to vest over several years and additional equity awards may be made in the future 

accounting for pension plans — the accounting for pension plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans’ assets and liabilities these assumptions include discount rates investment returns and projected salary increases among others the actuarial assumptions used in determining the funded statuses of the plans are provided in note 6 – pension plans  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

the expected rates of return on plan assets for fiscal 2014 range from 04 to 85 compared to 24 to 85 for the prior year we believe the range of rates selected for fiscal 2014 reflects the longterm returns expected on the plans’ assets considering recent market conditions projected rates of inflation the diversification of the plans’ assets and the expected real rates of market returns the discount rates used to compute plan liabilities were changed from a range of 06 to 84 in fiscal 2012 to a range of 04 to 93 in fiscal 2013 these assumptions represent the company’s best estimate of the rates at which its pension obligations could be effectively settled 

changes in the actuarial assumptions often have a material effect on the values assigned to plan assets and liabilities and the associated pension expense for example if the discount rate used to value the net pension benefit obligation “pbo” at september 27 2013 was higher lower by 05 the pbo would have been lower higher at that date by approximately 1124 million for nonus plans and by approximately 200 million for us plans if the expected return on plan assets was higher lower by 10 the net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2014 would be lower higher by approximately 98 million for nonus plans and by approximately 37 million for us plans differences between actuarial assumptions and actual performance ie actuarial gains and losses that are not recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost in the period in which such differences arise are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are recognized as part of net periodic pension cost in future periods in accordance with us gaap management monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in an effort to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used 

page 35 

  

contractual guarantees litigation investigations and insurance — in the normal course of business we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation the guarantees to which we are a party generally relate to project schedules and plant performance most of the litigation in which we are involved has us as a defendant in workers’ compensation personal injury environmental employmentlabor professional liability and other similar lawsuits we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations we have elected however to retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under our insurance programs this situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured and we intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of our contracts 

in accordance with us gaap we record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such guarantees litigation and insurance claims we include any adjustments to such liabilities in our consolidated results of operations 

in addition as a contractor providing services to the us federal government and several of its agencies we are subject to many levels of audits investigations and claims by or on behalf of the us federal government with respect to contract performance pricing costs cost allocations and procurement practices we adjust revenues based upon the amounts we expect to realize considering the effects of any client audits or governmental investigations 

testing goodwill for possible impairment — the goodwill carried on our consolidated balance sheets is tested annually for possible impairment in performing the annual impairment test we evaluate our goodwill at the reporting unit level we have determined that we have two reporting units which are based on geography we refer to these reporting units internally as “europe” and “noneurope” each of our reporting units conducts the business activities described elsewhere in this 2013 form 10k which includes providing professional technical services such as design engineering and architectural services construction andor construction management services and operations and maintenance services 

our geographybased reporting units reflect the company’s organizational structure which is based predominately on geography as well as our acquisition strategy which favors acquisition targets that among other things provide access to new geographic areas our reporting units represent rational groupings into which substantially all of our major acquisitions which are responsible for the goodwill appearing in our consolidated balance sheets have been assimilated and where all of the operations under each reporting unit share in the benefits of the goodwill created by our acquisitions 

us gaap does not prescribe a specific valuation method for estimating the fair value of reporting units the valuation technique used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including revenue growth rates operating margins discount rates and future market conditions among others 

for fiscal year 2011 we used a market approach for valuing our reporting units under this method the fair value of our reporting units were estimated by multiplying their respective aftertax earnings for the trailing twelve months by the company’s overall average market earnings multiple 

the key inputs used in the valuation model were the aftertax earnings of our reporting units and the company’s marketdriven average earnings multiple the multiple used for fiscal 2011 was approximately 18 

for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 we used both an income approach and a market approach to test our goodwill for possible impairment such approaches require us to make estimates and judgments under the income approach fair value is determined by using the discounted cash flows of our reporting units under the market approach the fair value of our reporting units is determined by reference to guideline companies that are reasonably comparable to our reporting units the fair values are estimated based on the valuation multiples of the invested capital associated with the guideline companies in assessing whether there is an indication that the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired we utilize the results of both valuation techniques and consider the range of fair values indicated the fair values for each reporting unit exceeded the respective book values by over 60 the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units in our testing were 

income approach 

2012 assumptions 

• company financial projections for fiscal years 2012 to 2015 

• weighted average cost of capital of 12 

• residual period growth rate of 3 

page 36 

2013 assumptions 

• company financial projections for fiscal years 2013 to 2016 

• weighted average cost of capital of 11 

• residual period growth rate of 3 

market approach 

with respect to the market approach for guideline publicly traded companies reasonably comparable to the companys reporting units the company used multiples ranging from 62 to 80 of ebitda and 73 to 96 of ebit for the fiscal year 2012 test applied to the trailing twelve months results of operations for each of our reporting units the company used multiples ranging from 63 to 80 of ebitda and 80 to 97 of ebit for the fiscal year 2013 test applied to the projected fiscal year 2013 financial results for each of our reporting units 

it is possible that changes in market conditions economy facts and circumstances judgments and assumptions used in estimating the fair value could change resulting in possible impairment of goodwill in the future the fair values resulting from the valuation techniques used are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of the reporting units to willing third parties 

the company performs the annual goodwill impairment test for the reporting units at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year the company will test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount we have determined that the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 

based on the most recent results of our annual impairment tests there were no indications of impairment of the goodwill shown in our consolidated balance sheets at either september 27 2013 or september 28 2012 furthermore the company performed an interim impairment assessment at september 27 2013 and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of either reporting unit had been reduced to an amount below its carrying amount

results of operations 

general 

our business focuses exclusively on providing technical professional services and field services to a large number of industrial commercial and governmental clients around the world the services we provide generally fall into four broad categories 

 the scope of services we can provide our clients therefore ranges from consulting and conceptual design services which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project to complete singleresponsibility designbuild contracts to services required in the post startup phases of a project such as operations and maintenance services 

the following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each of the last three fiscal years in thousands 

  



project services revenues for the year ended september 27 2013 increased 2845 million or 50 from the corresponding period last year these increases in project services revenues occurred principally in our north american and uk operations primarily in support of our clients in the chemicals and polymers and refining  downstream markets 

process scientific and systems consulting revenues for the year ended september 27 2013 decreased 663 million or 86 from the corresponding period last year the revenues in this service type primarily relate to science engineering and technical support services provided to our us government clients these decreases can be attributed primarily to the winding down of one project for the us federal government 

construction revenues for the year ended september 27 2013 increased 6806 million or 216 from the corresponding period last year the company continues to experience increased activity in the oil  gasupstream market particularly in canada in the chemicals and polymers market in the us and the uk and in the mining and minerals market in the us 

our operations and maintenance revenues for the year ended september 27 2013 were relatively unchanged although the mix of work changed operations and maintenance revenues in our national government programs increased 1446 million 

page 38 

for the year ended september 27 2013 from the corresponding period last year primarily as a result of an increase in our ownership of the business that manages and operates the strategic petroleum reserve for the us department of energy that increase was offset by a 1901 million decrease in our revenues related to our canadian operations for the year ended september 27 2013 from the corresponding period last year nevertheless we expect to see increases in our maintenance activity in our canadian operations in the near term 

we focus our services on clients operating in select industry groups and markets we believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit crossutilization of our resources the following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each of the last three fiscal years in thousands 

  

we recorded net earnings of 4231 million  or 323  per diluted share for the fiscal year ended september 27 2013  compared to 3790 million  or 294  per diluted share 375 million or 291 per diluted share excluding the pelletizing gain for the fiscal year ended september 28 2012  

revenues increased 9246 million  or 85  from 109 billion  for fiscal 2012  to 118 billion  for fiscal 2013  

revenues from clients operating in the chemicals and polymers industries increased 6864 million or 403 from 17 billion for fiscal 2012 to 24 billion for fiscal 2013 the effect of shale gas projects and the low price of natural gas continue to influence activity in the chemicals market because there is now a large source of feedstock available outside refineries which can grow independently of the refining infrastructure we believe more projects are now economically viable and capital is being deployed to develop these opportunities furthermore our clients are looking at various options to monetize natural gas this increased activity is primarily in the us and the uk along with smaller increases in the middle east and asia 

revenues from clients operating in the refining—downstream market decreased 424 million or 18 from 238 billion for fiscal 2012 to 234 billion for fiscal 2013 included in revenues for fiscal 2012 were a significant amount of passthrough costs for a large us based project that was winding down during fiscal 2012 notwithstanding these decreases we had strong sales in this market during fiscal 2013 and believe it will continue to be a strong market during fiscal 2014 looking forward several downstream companies have announced large capital projects and the industry is beginning to focus on compliance with the epa tier 3 ultra low sulfur gasoline regulations where we believe we are well positioned to support our clients with the required facility modifications 

national government programs revenues for fiscal 2013 remained relatively flat compared to fiscal 2012 uncertainties over us government budget issues and ongoing sequestration concerns remained a primary driver limiting our growth in this market these actions had little effect on the companys projects in backlog in this market during fiscal 2013 we believe that sequestration is slowing the release of new project opportunities in this market nevertheless we had significant aerospace and defense awards in this market during fiscal 2013 in addition certain recent changes in government contracting in the us have helped to stabilize this area of our business and may continue to help stabilize it in the future we have seen an increasing volume of work released by us government agencies in the form of multiple award task order contracts matoc these types of awards allow the company to bid on and participate in more government sites than large singleaward contracts we believe our cost profile makes us very competitive for matoctype awards 

revenues from clients operating in the infrastructure market decreased 698 million or 64 from 109 billion for fiscal 2012 to 102 billion for fiscal 2013 we believe the us market should benefit from several recent bond passages and we are leveraging our capabilities in the us and india into markets in the middle east and australia the uk market 

page 39 

should improve as the government has taken further action to increase the level of infrastructure spending we had significant wins in the us market in fiscal 2013 the partial us federal government shutdown has added some uncertainty to our us infrastructure market though we are experiencing little shortterm disruption 

revenues from clients operating in the oil and gas—upstream market increased 1249 million or 158 from 7905 million for fiscal 2012 to 9155 million for fiscal 2013 these increases were primarily a result of improvement in the canadian oil and gas business particularly in field services the company expects field services activity in the canadian market to remain strong as we move into fiscal 2014 as projections continue to show a strong oil price forecast we continue to see more opportunities in the middle east including unconventional gas development programs and large pipeline front end engineering and design feed projects the market in europe looks positive with a number of opportunities for engineering procurement and construction management epcm projects feeds for onshore terminal modifications and longterm sitebased alliances onshore development and production in the us continues to be strong the australian market is being driven by the development of liquefied natural gas export projects 

revenues from clients operating in the buildings market decreased 1055 million or 125 from 8440 million for fiscal 2012 to 7384 million for fiscal 2013 the current state of the us economy is impacting this market and we view this market as being flat in fiscal 2014 we see momentum building in healthcare k12 higher education federal civilian state and local and aviation that should see this market growing in fiscal 2015 our buildings business continues to shift towards projects for clients in the private sector opportunities in the private sector business are coming from mission critical education healthcare aviation and corporate and commercial programs and projects 

revenues from clients operating in the mining and minerals market increased 1622 million or 295 from 5501 million for fiscal 2012 to 7123 million for fiscal 2013 generally our clients in this market have been affected negatively by a general slowdown in the rate of growth in the chinese economy falling spot prices for iron ore coking and thermal coal and weaker commodity prices  albeit these declines have occurred from prices that were generally high from a historical perspective these trends have resulted in clients reducing their capital spending in the mining and minerals market despite this cooling market we were able to capture additional market share during fiscal 2013 the increase in revenues in this market in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily from projects based out of the us as we move into fiscal 2014 the company is focusing on smallcap projects and maintenancedriven work for our clients in this market the potential for legislative changes during fiscal 2014 in australia could have a positive influence in this market as early as the later part of fiscal 2014 

revenues from clients operating in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets decreased 528 million or 92 from 5763 million for fiscal 2012 to 5235 million for fiscal 2013 though several of our customers have delayed projects we view this market as steady with potential growth prospects in the areas of biotechnologybased drug development in europe and north america and secondary manufacturing expansion in asia the uk and south america as we move into fiscal 2014 we view this market as steady to slightly up in the us uk ireland and mainland europe we continue to view china as a strong market with the government emphasizing improvement in the nations healthcare system 

industrial and other includes the pulp  paper hightechnology manufacturing power and food beverage  consumer products industry groups and markets revenues from clients operating in the industrial and other markets increased 2096 million or 304 from 6901 million for fiscal 2012 to 8998 million for fiscal 2013 the increases in industrial and other revenues were due primarily to increased activity in the pulp  paper market in the us and the hightechnology manufacturing market in ireland 

direct costs of contracts increased 8093 million  or 88  from 917 billion  during fiscal 2012  to 998 billion  during fiscal 2013  direct costs of contracts include all costs incurred in connection with and directly for the benefit of client contracts including depreciation and amortization relating to assets used in connection with providing the services required by client projects the level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors including the amount of passthrough costs we incur during a period on those projects where we are responsible for subcontract labor or thirdparty materials and equipment we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs and we refer to such costs as “passthrough costs” on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not considered passthrough costs and are therefore not reflected in either revenues or costs to the extent that we incur a significant amount of passthrough costs in a period our direct cost of contracts are likely to increase as well 

passthrough costs increased 2964 million  or 127  from 233 billion  during fiscal 2012  to 262 billion  for fiscal 2013  in general passthrough costs are more significant on projects that have a higher content of field services activities passthrough costs are generally incurred at a specific point in the lifecycle of a project and are highly dependent on the needs 

page 40 

of our individual clients and the nature of the clients’ projects however because we have hundreds of projects which start at various times within a fiscal year the effect of passthrough costs on the level of direct costs of contracts can vary between fiscal years without there being a fundamental or significant change to the underlying business 

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts were 844  for fiscal 2013  compared to 841  for fiscal 2012  the relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided generally speaking the more procurement we do on behalf of our clients ie where we purchase equipment and materials for use on projects andor procure subcontracts in connection with projects and the more field services revenues we have relative to technical professional services revenues the higher the ratio will be of direct costs of contracts to revenues because revenues from passthrough costs typically have lower margin rates associated with them it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in such revenues without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit the increase in the ratio of direct costs of contracts to revenues in fiscal 2013 as compared to last year was due primarily to a slight decrease in margins for our professional services offset by improved margins for our field services 

selling general and administrative sga expenses for fiscal 2013  increased by 424 million  or 38  to 117 billion  compared to 113 billion  for fiscal 2012  the increase in sga is primarily reflective of the companys increased business activity when compared to the corresponding periods last year as a percentage of revenues sga costs have declined for fiscal 2013 as compared to the corresponding period last year 

interest expense for fiscal 2013 increased 12 million to 129 million from 117 million in fiscal 2012 interest expense in both fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 was due primarily to the debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of the aker entities the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2013 when compared to fiscal 2012 is related primarily to the accrual of interest related to a potential tax liability from an acquisition completed in fiscal 2012 

the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate was 335 for fiscal 2013 compared to 341 in fiscal 2012 the companys lower effective income tax rate in fiscal 2013 when compared to the corresponding period last year was due primarily to an increase in income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the normal course of our business we may engage in numerous transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in income or deducted as an expense is uncertain additionally we file income franchise gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service most states in the us and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the us we continually monitor the appropriateness of the rate and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will change 

fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 

we recorded net earnings of 379 million or 294 per diluted share 375 million or 291 per diluted share excluding the pelletizing gain for the fiscal year ended september 28 2012 compared to 3310 million or 260 per diluted share for the fiscal year ended september 30 2011 

revenues increased 5121 million or 49 from 1038 billion for fiscal 2011 to 1089 billion for fiscal 2012 

revenues from clients operating in the chemicals and polymers industries increased 2436 million or 167 from 15 billion for fiscal 2011 to 17 billion for fiscal 2012 the effect of shale gas projects and the low price of natural gas had an impact on the chemicals market in fiscal 2012 

revenues from clients operating in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets increased 1716 million or 424 from 4047 million for fiscal 2011 to 5763 million for fiscal 2012 this increase was due primarily to a number of new and continuing projects including projects relating to vaccine production facilities 

revenues from clients operating in the refining—downstream market increased 1237 million or 55 from 226 billion for fiscal 2011 to 238 billion for fiscal 2012 the increase was due primarily to higher business volume principally within the companys operations in the us and canada 

revenues from clients operating in the mining and minerals market increased 1009 million or 225 from 4492 million for fiscal 2011 to 5501 million for fiscal 2012 this increase was due primarily to the inclusion of the revenues of the aker entities for all of fiscal 2012 versus only a portion of fiscal 2011 the aker entities refer to certain businesses that were acquired in separate transactions that were completed in february and april 2011 and which are described 

page 41 

in more detail in note 3— business combinations  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of the companys 2012 annual report on form 10k 

revenues from clients operating in the oil and gas—upstream market increased 371 million or 49 from 7535 million for fiscal 2011 to 7905 million for fiscal 2012 the increase is related primarily to higher business volume in the companys canadian operations 

national government programs revenues for fiscal 2012 were relatively flat compared to fiscal 2011 we believe that uncertainties associated with sequestration ie that mechanism within the budget control act of 2011 that can trigger automatic us government spending cuts in the event the us congress and the president fail to agree on a budget by the end of calendar 2012 caused several agencies to slow the release of work in 2012 nevertheless certain recent changes in government contracting in the us have helped to stabilize this area of our business and may continue to help stabilize it in the future we have seen an increasing volume of work released by us government agencies in the form of multiple award task order contracts matoc these types of awards allow the company to bid on and participate in more government sites than large singleaward contracts we believe our cost profile makes us very competitive for matoctype awards 

revenues from clients operating in the buildings market decreased 496 million or 55 from 8935 million for fiscal 2011 to 8440 million for fiscal 2012 during the year we saw shifts in this industry group towards projects for clients in the private sector which was driven by a continuing decline in government spending growth in the private sector business came from mission critical education healthcare aviation and corporate and commercial programs and projects 

direct costs of contracts increased 3446 million or 39 from 882 billion during fiscal 2011 to 917 billion during fiscal 2012 direct costs of contracts include all costs incurred in connection with and directly for the benefit of client contracts including depreciation and amortization relating to assets used in connection with providing the services required by client projects the level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors including the amount of passthrough costs we incur during a period on those projects where we are responsible for subcontract labor or thirdparty materials and equipment we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs and we refer to such costs as “passthrough costs” on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not considered passthrough costs and are therefore not reflected in either revenues or costs to the extent that we incur a significant amount of passthrough costs in a period our direct cost of contracts are likely to increase as well 

passthrough costs increased 2099 million or 99 from 212 billion during fiscal 2011 to 233 billion for fiscal 2012 in general passthrough costs are more significant on projects that have a higher content of field services activities field services revenues however decreased 672 million or 15 from 450 billion during fiscal 2011 to 443 billion during fiscal 2012 passthrough costs are generally incurred at a specific point in the lifecycle of a project and are highly dependent on the needs of our individual clients and the nature of the clients’ projects however because we have hundreds of projects which start at various times within a fiscal year the effect of passthrough costs on the level of direct costs of contracts can vary between fiscal years without there being a fundamental or significant change to the underlying business 

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts were 841 for fiscal 2012 compared to 850 for fiscal 2011 the relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided generally speaking the more procurement we do on behalf of our clients ie where we purchase equipment and materials for use on projects andor procure subcontracts in connection with projects and the more field services revenues we have relative to technical professional services revenues the higher the ratio will be of direct costs of contracts to revenues because revenues from passthrough costs typically have lower margin rates associated with them it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in such revenues without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit the decrease in the ratio of direct costs of contracts to revenues in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was due primarily to improved margins for our project services margins relating to our field services were virtually unchanged 

selling general and administrative sga expenses for fiscal 2012 increased by 903 million or 87 to 113 billion compared to 104 billion for fiscal 2011 these increases were due primarily to the sga expenses attributable to acquired businesses 

operating profit was 5961 million for the fiscal year ended september 28 2012 compared to 5189 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2011 as a percentage of revenues operating profit was 55 for fiscal 2012 compared to 50 in fiscal 2011 improved margins for our project services contributed to this increase 

page 42 

interest income during fiscal 2012 increased 11 million as compared to the prior year contributing to this increase was higher average cash balances on deposit in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 

interest expense for fiscal 2012 increased 29 million as compared to fiscal 2011 interest expense in both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 was due primarily to the debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of the aker entities the increase is due primarily to the inclusion of interest expense associated with acquisition indebtedness for all of fiscal 2012 versus only a portion of fiscal 2011 

the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate was 341 for fiscal 2012 compared to 351 in fiscal 2011 in general the lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was due to the changing geographical source of our earnings combined with an increase in the utilization of us foreign tax credits 

  

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth certain information about our contractual obligations as of september 27 2013 in thousands 

  



  

 backlog 

backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us with respect to om contracts however we include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for only one succeeding year regardless of the remaining life of the contract for national government programs other than us federal om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding option periods 

page 43 

the following table summarizes our backlog for each of the last three fiscal years in millions   



the entire value of contract awards are added to backlog when the contracts are awarded to us accordingly backlog can fluctuate from one reporting period to the next due to the timing of when new contracts are added to backlog and when the contract revenue is recognized in our consolidated financial statements many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years our backlog at september 27 2013  increased by 13 billion  or 82  to 172 billion  from 159 billion  at september 28 2012  the increase in backlog from september 28 2012 to september 27 2013 was due primarily to new awards from clients operating in the oil  gasupstream chemicals and polymers refining downstream infrastructure aerospace and defense and buildings industry groups and markets 

in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client in a situation where a client terminates a contract we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and in certain instances we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs there were no significant project cancellations in fiscal 2013  

while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein accordingly backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenues 

  

backlog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies totaled approximately 41 billion or 238 of total backlog 36 billion or 229 of total backlog and 36 billion or 249 of total backlog at september 27 2013 september 28 2012 and september 30 2011 respectively most of our federal contracts require that services be provided beyond one year in general these contracts must be funded annually ie the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the us congress to the procuring agency and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts 

subject to the factors discussed in item 1a— risk factors  above we estimate that approximately 84 billion or 484 of total backlog at september 27 2013 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year 

effects of inflation 

the effects of inflation on our business is discussed in item 1a— risk factors  and is incorporated herein by reference 

liquidity and capital resources 

at september 27 2013  our primary sources of liquidity consisted of 126 billion  of cash and cash equivalents and 7791 million  of available borrowing capacity under our 121 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility we finance as much of our operations and growth as possible through cash generated by our operations 

during fiscal 2013  our cash and cash equivalents increased by 2239 million  from 103 billion  at september 28 2012  to 126 billion  at september 27 2013  this compares to a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of 1268 million  during the corresponding period last year during fiscal 2013 we experienced net cash inflows of 4485 million  from operating activities these cash inflows were offset by cash outflows of 1571 million  from investing activities and 597 million  from financing activities along with 78 million  from the effects of exchange rate changes 

operations provided net cash of 4485 million  during fiscal 2013  this compares to net cash inflows of 2998 million  and 2365 million  during fiscal 2012 and 2011 respectively the 1487 million  increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012 was due primarily to a 492 million  increase in net earnings attributable to the group a 523 million  favorable change in the companys working capital accounts a 196 million  change related to the companys defined benefit pension plans and a 142 million  change related to stock based compensation 

because such a high percentage of our revenues are earned on costplus type contracts and due to the significance of revenues relating to passthrough costs most of the costs we incur are included in invoices we send to clients although we continually monitor our accounts receivable we manage the operating cash flows of the company by managing the working 

page 44 

capital accounts in total rather than by the individual elements the primary elements of the company’s working capital accounts are accounts receivable accounts payable and billings in excess of cost accounts payable consists of obligations to third parties relating primarily to costs incurred for projects which are generally billable to clients accounts receivable consist of billings to our clients — a substantial portion of which is for projectrelated costs billings in excess of cost consist of billings to and payments from our clients for costs yet to be incurred 

this relationship between revenues and costs and between receivables and payables is unique to our industry and facilitates review of our liquidity at the total working capital level the changes in cash flows relating to our working capital accounts were due simply to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts and is not indicative of any known trend or fundamental change to the underlying business we still continue to experience delays in certain payments and have seen an increase in the length of payment terms with certain customers we believe that this situation does not present a significant risk to the companys cash flows we believe the risk of not collecting substantially all of the companys outstanding receivables is remote though the company provides services in a number of countries outside the us we believe our credit risk is not significant our private sector customers are comprised principally of large well known and well established multinational companies our government customers are comprised of national state and local agencies located principally in the us and the uk we have not historically experienced significant collection issues with either of our governmental or nongovernmental customers 

  

we used 1571 million  of cash and cash equivalents for investing activities during fiscal 2013  this compares to 1811 million  and 8018 million  during fiscal 2012 and 2011 respectively the company did not engage in any significant financing activity during fiscal 2013  

additions to property and equipment totaled 1273 million  1026 million  and 987 million  for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively included in fiscal 2013 activity are significant expenditures for leasehold improvements relating primarily to the consolidation of certain office space expansion of office space and relocations of certain office space all occurring in a number of locations 

our financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 597 million  and 27 million  during fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012 respectively this compares to net cash inflows of 5569 million  during fiscal 2011 the 570 million  net increase in cash outflows from financing activities during fiscal 2013  as compared to fiscal 2012 was due primarily to the net decrease in the companys outstanding debt 

the company had 126 billion  of cash and short term equivalents at september 27 2013  of this amount approximately 9322 million was held in the us and 3242 million was held outside of the us primarily in canada the uk and the eurozone other than the tax cost of repatriating funds held outside the us to the us see note 9— income taxes  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k there are no impediments to repatriating these funds to the us 

the total amount utilized under the 2012 facility at september 27 2013  was 4259 million   4151 million  in the form of direct borrowings and 108 million  utilized in the form of letters of credit please refer to note 5— borrowings of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding the 2012 facility 

we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations support our acquisition strategy and service our debt for the next twelve months we had 126 billion  in cash and cash equivalents at september 27 2013  compared to 103 billion  at september 28 2012  our consolidated working capital position at september 27 2013  was 215 billion  an increase of 2869 million  from september 28 2012  

as noted in the companys form 8k dated september 8 2013 we entered into a merger implementation deed with sinclair knight merz “skm” a 6500 person professional services firm headquartered in australia for an estimated purchase price of 11 billion the company has adequate cash and existing debt capacity to finance this transaction and fund our operations 

additionally there was 7791 million  of borrowing capacity available at september 27 2013  under the 2012 facility we believe that the remaining capacity terms and conditions of our revolving credit facility combined with cash onhand and the other committed and uncommitted facilities we have in place are adequate for our working capital and general business requirements 

page 45 

the company had 2433 million  of letters of credit outstanding at september 27 2013  of this amount 108 million   were issued under the 2012 facility and 2325 million  were issued under separate committed and uncommitted letterofcredit facilities 

offbalance sheet arrangements

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act management with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the evaluation date based on the framework established in “ internal control—integrated framework”  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management has concluded that the company’s internal controls over financial reporting as of the evaluation date were effective the company’s independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting which appears later in this annual report on form 10k 

changes in internal control 

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the company’s fiscal quarter ended september 27 2013  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

page 47 

limitations on effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its system of internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed or operated can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of internal control are met the design of the company’s control system reflects the fact that there are resource constraints and that the benefits of such control system must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control failures and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the intentional acts of individuals by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that the design of any particular control will always succeed in achieving its objective under all potential future conditions

general background information 

we are one of the largest technical professional services firms in the world we provide a diverse range of technical professional and construction services to a large number of industrial commercial and governmental clients we provide four broad categories of services 

 we focus our services on clients operating in the following industries and markets 

 page3 

we are headquartered in pasadena california usa and provide our services through more than 200 offices located around the globe primarily in north america south america europe the middle east india australia africa and asia 

how we operate 

the relationships we have with our clients drive our business as a broadbased technical professional services firm we offer a range of services to help our clients maintain a competitive edge in their respective markets from feasibility studies to design to engineering to construction to startup and commissioning and then to operations and maintenance we customize our services to meet business and project goals our global network of professionals works with a multioffice approach in an effort to provide clients with the best most economical project or program solutions 

we strive to provide client value through continuous improvement in our performance we regularly monitor our clients expectations our quality system and our operational performance tools such as our jacobs value enhancing practices global standard operating procedures project reviews the jacobs system to ensure project success jsteps and safe plans of action spas provide added value to our clients projects they also allow us to create performance improvement actions during the project execution through continuous improvement upon our performance our tools and our processes we believe we can offer our clients superior value when they do business with us 

jacobsvalue sm value plus is an internal tool we use to document and quantify the actual value or savings we provide to our clients and their projects some of the benefits achieved through the value plus program include lower total installed cost shorter schedule and reduced life cycle cost value plus is implemented at project initiation a project goal is created and costsaving ideas are entered into the value plus database when the value plus cycle is complete the project team and client identify unique cost andor schedule reductions for the project 

our business model 

our organizational structure and integrated system for delivering services are key components of our business strategy our operating units generally use a matrix organizational structure whereby our project management functions are supported by the various technical planning design and construction disciplines that are necessary to effectively execute longterm engineering and construction contracts we recognize that technical expertise alone cannot grow our business project management skills and the ability to manage multimillion dollar projects and programs for our clients is critical to our success crucial functions such as project controls and procurement are embedded within each of our major offices and serve operations by providing specialized services required by projects 

in managing our business we encourage cooperation not competition across all of our offices we do not maintain profit centers and we expect our offices to provide and share resources to deliver those services required by our client contracts regardless of which office owns the contract as an example we sponsor one companywide incentive bonus plan that rewards employees based on the results of the company as a whole our organizational structure encourages our operating groups to work collaboratively while simultaneously helping to reduce costs and promote an efficient delivery system for all of our services 

three important concepts support our business model a multidomestic approach a boundaryless approach and a focus on cost management 

our global reach enables us to provide local customized service worldwide we work in many countries with locallystaffed offices that share a common set of values and a single vision while maintaining oneonone contact with individual clients this approach provides customized services suited to the locale and defines our multidomestic approach 

we take a boundaryless approach to our business this means that we try to enhance local expertise with the best talent and the best technology the company has to offer regardless of office location the diversity of our employees reflects our geographic reach as well as the wide range of our technical capabilities our talent pool is flexible so we are able to be where our clients need us doing the work that is necessary to achieve solutions for them 

our continual emphasis on managing costs is an important component of our business model as companies providing technical professional and construction services are required to compete against each other across geographic boundaries the company that can provide its clients with costefficient solutions to their project needs has an advantage managing general and administrative “ga” costs is in our nature since jacobs founding in 1947 keeping costs down has been critical to the way we operate another way we provide savings to our clients is by utilizing resources in our overseas offices that may be more cost competitive with our focus on driving costs down throughout every level of our organization we strive to deliver superior technical professional and construction services safely efficiently and within the cost and time parameters our clients require 

page4 

the companys culture 

our employees are our most important and valuable asset and therefore the prevention of jobrelated injuries is given top priority it is the policy of the company to provide and maintain a safe and healthy working environment and to follow operating practices that safeguard all employees and result in a more efficient operation 

beyondzero®  the name of our program that promotes our culture of caring moves beyond efforts to have an incident and injuryfree safety performance we implement a true culture of caring where concern for employees health safety and welfare extends outside the office walls beyond the project site fences and into their homes cars and all the places where they interact with family friends and fellow employees 

our employees and business partners are expected to follow the highest principles of business conduct integrity and ethics as they carry out their responsibilities our employees are guided by the following principles in carrying out their responsibilities loyalty compliance with applicable laws observance of ethical standards avoidance of conflicts of interest and communication we endeavor to deal fairly with our employees customers suppliers and competitors and to respect the policies and procedures of those outside the company 

our objective is to present a clear and consistent image of our company to our clients employees shareholders and business partners — regarding how we behave how we communicate how we look and most importantly how our promises to our clients are delivered — anywhere in the world 

we accomplish this foremost through our core values which allow us to behave as one company and unify us worldwide by keeping our core values as a central focus of our company we are able to think the same way and arrive at similar conclusions regardless of our physical location our core values are 

 our core values are consistent with our commitment to sustainability we see sustainability as a balance between the social economic and environmental aspects of a business too much emphasis on any single aspect cannot achieve sustainability our core values drive us to continuously improve efficiencies and reduce energy and natural resources practices that drive down costs and contribute to a lower impact on the environment around the world across all disciplines we work to demonstrate our commitment to sustainability through our actions and project delivery that commitment is reflected every day through our lowcost posture our beyondzero® safety philosophy and our adherence to our seven principles of sustainability these principles are 

 delivering timely and efficient engineering and design services and effective tailored sustainable solutions are the best way we can save our clients money and make their businesses successful such sustainable solutions that allow our clients to achieve their project goals are a key aspect of the creation of an enduring sustainable legacy 

applying the best most efficient and effective sustainable solutions for our clients worldwide in all major industries in which we operate allows us to make a significant contribution to a safe and sustainable future 

with respect to human resources our goal is to establish an inclusive diverse workplace that energizes the people who fuel our companys growth although we are a large company with over 60000 employees in more than 25 countries our employees are unified in their focus on superior value safety and ethical business practices regardless of the country 

our work locations around the world are multicultural and our people are successful at building networks breaking down boundaries and embracing diversity they collaborate and learn new skills from one another we recognize that an 

page5 

inclusive environment is a healthy one that results in better decisions better talent and more creative solutions to offer our clients we seek employees that operate with a boundaryless mindset 

we have engaged committed and productive people who add value to our project teams we focus on hiring the best keeping the best and continually improving the skills and capabilities of individuals and teams 

how we grow 

we are committed to a relationshipbased business model which is central to our sustained growth and profitability we pursue the development of longterm relationships and alliances with our clients by working with our clients on their capital programs we increase our understanding of their overall business needs as well as the unique technical requirements of their specific projects this increased understanding enables us we believe to provide superior value to our clients our approach provides us with opportunities to market all the services our clients are expected to need in the predesign phase such as master planning permitting or project finance options in the design phase and in the construction poststartup and commissioning phases of a facility including operations and maintenance services 

our relationships with clients also present ongoing opportunities to expand into adjacent markets for example clients operating in the mining and minerals market often have a need for our infrastructure and buildings capabilities the same is true for clients operating in other markets 

we market our services to clients in a wide range of public and institutional process and industrial markets we increase our opportunities through selective market diversity and are able to price contracts more competitively and enhance overall profitability while delivering additional value to our clients by integrating and bundling our services in complex economic times we have the ability to evolve along with market cycles worldwide when opportunities decrease in a particular market or geography other opportunities often increase because of our selective market diversity we believe we are wellpositioned to address a wide range of opportunities across many markets and geographies which helps us grow our business 

closely linked to our relationshipbased business model is our multidomestic geographic strategy our core clients can depend on us for assistance with their engineering and construction needs when they move projects around the world we therefore follow our clients into new geographic regions which helps us perform meaningful portions of their projects by utilizing local resources rather than exporting the work to other offices 

the role of acquisitions in the development our business 

when we review acquisition targets we are conscious of the effect the acquisition may have on our client base we favor acquisitions that allow us to i expand into a new client market ii enhance the range of services we provide existing clients andor iii access new geographic areas in which our clients either already operate or plan to expand by expanding into new geographic areas and adding to our existing technical and project management capabilities we strive to position ourselves as a preferred singlesource provider of technical professional and construction services to our major clients the following is a brief description of some of our recent key acquisitions 

 page6 

and technology higher education mission critical and interiors 

 page7 

after we complete an acquisition we move very quickly to integrate the newlyacquired operations we typically assign senior operations personnel to manage the overall integration process with assistance from our sales accounting legal it human resources and risk management departments although integrating newly acquired businesses can be very challenging the assimilation process is critical in order to assure i that our global businesses processes and systems are properly deployed throughout the newlyacquired entities and ii that we can begin to leverageoff the acquired talents skills and expertise to grow our business and help our clients execute their capital programs newlyacquired businesses are not left as standalone entities within the company’s internal reporting system the businesses we acquire are typically foldedin to existing operational organizations within the company 

financial information about segments 

although we describe our business in this annual report on form 10k in terms of the various services we provide the markets in which our clients operate and the geographic areas in which we operate we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment pursuant to those accounting principles generally accepted in the us “us gaap” in making this determination we considered the various economic characteristics of our operations including the nature of the services we provide the nature of our internal processes for delivering and distributing those services and the types of customers we have in addition to the discussion that follows please refer to note 14 — segment information  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

there is a high degree of similarity among the workforces employed across the categories of services we provide for example professionals in engineering and design services ie services provided by persons who are degreed and in certain circumstances licensed such as engineers architects scientists and economists exist in all four service categories in addition there is a high degree of similarity among a significant component of the workforces we employ to perform construction and operations and maintenance om projects in providing construction and om services we employ a large number of skilled craft labor personnel these may include welders pipe fitters electricians crane operators and other personnel who work on very large capital projects in the case of projects classified within the construction services category or on smaller capital projects in the case of maintenance projects classified within the om services category 

all of our offices use a matrix organizational structure our results therefore are dependent on groups representing technical disciplines eg electrical engineering mechanical engineering cost engineering etc supporting project management personnel who maintain the relationship between our clients and us and are ultimately responsible for delivering projects to our clients safely on time and on budget additionally all of our operating regions use common tools policies and procedures to manage and run their respective units these include project review meetings project performance evaluations and project execution plans 

  

each of the companys operating regions provide most of the services the company offers generally and each of our operating regions include in its customer base many of the same or similar clients as our other regions 

the use of technology throughout our organization is highly uniform whether it is computeraided design and drafting “cadd” applications used by our engineering and design staff or modeling programs used by the scientific and consulting staff or scheduling estimating and cost control applications used by homeoffice personnel in support of our construction and maintenance activities all of the service categories described above are equally affected by changes in technology as they occur in the economy at large 

furthermore the types of information and internal reports used by the company’s chief operating decision maker the “codm” who is also the company’s chief executive officer and other members of management to monitor performance evaluate results of operations allocate resources and otherwise manage the business support a single reportable segment accordingly based on these similarities we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment for purposes of the disclosures included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

page8 

services provided 

as described above the services we provide generally fall into the following four broad categories project services process scientific and systems consulting services construction services and operations and maintenance services 

the following table sets forth our revenues from each of our four service categories for each of the last five fiscal years in thousands 



project services 

we employ the engineering architecture interiors design planning and related disciplines necessary to design and engineer modern process plants buildings infrastructure projects technology and manufacturing facilities consumer products manufacturing facilities power plants and stations pulp and paper plants and other facilities 

we are capable of providing our clients with a variety of value engineering services including safety in design through safety in design we integrate best practices hazard analysis and risk assessment methods early in the design phase of projects taking those steps necessary to eliminate or mitigate injury and damage during the construction startup testing and commissioning and operations phases of a project 

in the area of construction management we provide our clients with a wide range of services as an agent for our clients we may act as program director whereby we oversee on the owners behalf the complete planning design and construction phases of the project alternatively our services may be limited to providing construction consulting 

project services also includes planning scheduling procurement estimating cost engineering project accounting quality and safety and all other key support services needed for complete cradletograve project delivery 

process scientific and systems consulting services 

we employ the professional and technical skills and expertise with respect to a broad range of consulting services including performing pricing studies market analyses and financial projections necessary in determining the feasibility of a project performing gasoline reformulation modeling analyzing and evaluating layout and mechanical designs for complex processing plants analyzing automation and control systems analyzing designing and executing biocontainment strategies developing and performing process protocols with respect to the us food and drug administrationmandated qualification and validation requirements and performing geological and metallurgical studies 

also included in this service category are revenues relating to defense and aerospacerelated programs such services typically are more technical and scientific in nature than other project services we provide and may involve such tasks as supporting the development and testing of conventional weapons systems weapons modeling and simulations computer systems development maintenance and support evaluation and testing of missioncritical control systems aerospace testing and propulsion systems and facilities and other highly technical or scientific tasks 

construction 

in addition to the construction management services included under project services above we provide traditional field construction services to private and public sector clients we also provide our clients with a modular construction option our modular construction includes the engineering and construction of a facility in an offsite fabrication and assembly environment with final completion during the field erection phase the option provides our clients with an alternative approach to traditional methods of engineering and construction which can compress and shorten the construction schedule reduce risk lower costs and provide environmental benefits in the area of environmental remediation and restoration we also provide environmental remedial construction services for a variety of public and private sector clients 

page9 

historically our field construction activities have been focused primarily on those construction projects for which we perform much of the related engineering and design work by focusing our construction efforts in this way we minimize the risks associated with constructing complex projects based on designs prepared by third parties the financial risk to us of constructing complex assets based on designs prepared by third parties may be particularly significant on fixedprice contracts therefore we generally avoid this type of project however we will pursue constructiononly projects when we can negotiate pricing and other contract terms we deem acceptable and which we believe can result in a fair return for the degree of risk we assume 

operations and maintenance om services 

om refers to all of the tasks required to operate and maintain large complex facilities on behalf of clients we provide key management and support services over all aspects of the operations of a facility including managing subcontractors and other onsite personnel om also includes process plant maintenance services which generally involves all tasks required to keep a process plant typically a refinery or chemical plant in daytoday operation 

within the aerospace and defense areas om often requires us to provide the management and technical support services necessary to operate and maintain such sites as engine test facilities weapons integration facilities and hightech simulation and verification centers such om contracts also frequently require us to provide facilities management and maintenance services utilities operations and maintenance services property management and disposition services and construction support services 

within the environmental area om often includes engineering and technical support services as well as program management services necessary to remediate contaminated sites 

although the gross profit margins we realize from om services are generally lower than those associated with the other services we provide the costs to support maintenance activities are also generally lower also om services offer us an opportunity for longterm relationships with clients this aspect of maintenance services greatly reduces the selling costs in respect of such services 

the industries and markets in which our clients operate 

we market our services to clients where the scope of work required by their capital projects and programs is within our expertise within each market we may offer specialty services unique to the sector or services which differentiate us from our competitors in the marketplace

backlog 

backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us with respect to om contracts however we include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for only one succeeding year regardless of the remaining life of the contract for national government programs other than us federal om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding option periods in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation termination or suspension at the discretion of the client in addition the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts accordingly backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings 

page14 

our backlog includes expected revenues for contracts that are based on estimates for information regarding our backlog including those risk factors specific to backlog please refer to item 1a — risk factors  and item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  below 

significant customers 

the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government for each of the last five fiscal years   



it is uncommon for a commercial customer to contribute 10 or more of the company’s total revenues on occasion however we will perform a number of field services projects for a single customer in the same fiscal year which primarily because of the amount of passthrough costs discussed below that is included in revenue will cause total revenue from that customer to exceed 10 of total consolidated revenues for the fiscal year ended october 2 2009 revenues earned from motiva enterprises llc accounted for 122 of total consolidated revenues 

financial information about geographic areas 

selected financial information regarding the geographic areas in which we operate is included in note 14 — segment information  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k and is incorporated herein by reference 

contracts 

while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake our contracts generally fall into two broad categories costreimbursable and fixedprice the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the last five fiscal years 

  



in accordance with industry practice most of our contracts including those with the us federal government are subject to termination at the discretion of the client which is discussed in greater detail in item 1a — risk factors in such situations our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination 

when we are directly responsible for engineering design procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client’s plant or facility we reflect the costs of materials equipment and subcontracts in both revenues and costs on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs the following table sets forth the approximate amount of such passthrough costs included in revenues for each of the last five fiscal years in millions of dollars 

  



costreimbursable contracts 

costreimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit the profit element may be in the form of a simple markup applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee or a combination of a markup and a fee the fee element can also take several forms the fee may be a fixed amount it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred or it may be an incentive fee based on targets milestones or performance factors defined in the contract in general we prefer costreimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price 

page15 

fixedprice contracts 

fixedprice contracts include both “lump sum bid” contracts and “negotiated fixedprice” contracts under lump sum bid contracts we typically bid against other contractors based on specifications the client furnishes this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period additionally it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients which is contrary to our relationshipbased business model accordingly lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract in contrast under a negotiated fixedprice contract we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client negotiated fixedprice contracts frequently exist in singleresponsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project thus although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us however because of economies that may be realized during the contract term both negotiated fixedprice and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts over the past five years most of our fixedprice work has been either negotiated fixedprice contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services rather than turnkey construction

 item 1a risk factors 

we operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future we may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial if any such events actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces if we fail to maintain safe work sites we can be exposed to significant financial losses as well as civil and criminal liabilities 

construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment moving vehicles chemical and manufacturing processes and highly regulated materials on many sites we are responsible for safety and accordingly must implement safety procedures if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective our employees and others may become injured unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover increase the cost of a project to our clients and raise our operating costs any of the foregoing could result in financial losses which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials which if improperly handled or disposed of could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health safety and environmental “hse” work procedures throughout our organization including construction sites and maintenance sites the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability 

our safety record is critical to our reputation many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures as a result our failure to maintain adequate safety standards could result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

negative conditions in the credit and financial markets could impair our ability to operate our business implement our acquisition strategy or access our cash and shortterm investments it could also adversely affect our customers’ businesses 

although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions in addition some of our clients depend on the availability of credit to help finance their capital projects due to the continuing instability of the credit markets in the us and abroad the availability of credit has continued to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain in spite of government efforts to stabilize the credit markets this situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds refinance our existing indebtedness enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us in addition these market conditions could negatively impact our clients’ ability to fund their projects and therefore utilize our services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors suppliers and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements on less favorable terms with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are therefore subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices in weak economic environments we may experience increased delays and failures due to among other reasons a diminution in our clients’ access to the credit markets if one or more clients delays in paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

furthermore our cash balances and shortterm investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and 

page18 

financial institutions located primarily in north america europe south america australia and asia some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership or have been seized by their governments there is a risk that this may occur in the future if this were to occur we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund operations 

our vulnerability to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our clients operate is exacerbated during economic downturns 

we provide technical professional construction and om services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration production and refining programs for various national governments including the us federal government chemicals and polymers mining and minerals pharmaceuticals and biotechnology infrastructure buildings power and other general industrial and consumer businesses and markets such as technology and manufacturing pulp and paper and food and consumer products these markets and the resulting demand for our services have been and we expect will continue to be cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control including economic conditions and changes in client spending particularly during periods of economic uncertainty 

current global economic conditions have negatively impacted many of our clients’ ability and willingness to fund their projects they have also caused our clients to reduce their capital expenditures alter the mix of services purchased seek more favorable price and other contract terms and otherwise slow their spending on our services for example in the public sector declines in state tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending in addition due to these conditions many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable these conditions have reduced the demand for our services which has had a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations 

current economic conditions also make it extremely difficult for our clients our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could cause businesses to continue to slow spending on our services we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery worldwide or in our clients’ markets in addition our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and therefore may not recover as quickly as the economy at large a continuation or worsening of current weak economic conditions or a reduction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

regardless of economic or market conditions investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients’ markets and investment decisions as a result our past results have varied and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate 

fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers’ investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation delays in existing work or changes in the timing and funding of new awards 

commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways for example for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil gas copper or fertilizers fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and therefore their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments to the extent commidity prices decline and our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects the demand for our services decreases which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned as well as those in progress and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel 

the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel including engineers architects designers craft personnel and corporate management professionals who have the required experience and expertise from time to time it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients in certain geographic areas for example we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel 

page19 

in addition as some of our key personnel approach retirement age we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the cost of providing our services including the extent to which we utilize our workforce affects our profitability for example the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts if an expected contract award is delayed or not received we could incur cost resulting from excess staff reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business financial conditions and results of operations 

the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are a party to litigation in the normal course of business since we engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities and projects where design construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to employees or others we are exposed to substantial claims and litigation if there is a failure at any such project such claims could relate to among other things personal injury loss of life business interruption property damage pollution and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties such as those who use or reside near our clients’ projects we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met in many of our contracts with clients subcontractors and vendors we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages penalties losses and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts in addition while clients and subcontractors may agree to indemnify us against certain liabilities such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us 

we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations our insurance programs have varying coverage limits and maximums and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make in addition we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under these programs as a result we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured our insurers are also subject to business risk and as a result one or more of them may be unable to fulfill their insurance obligations due to insolvency or otherwise 

in addition the nature of our business sometimes results in clients subcontractors and vendors presenting claims to us for among other things recovery of costs related to certain projects similarly we occasionally present change orders and other claims to our clients subcontractors and vendors if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients subcontractors and vendors we could incur cost overruns reduced profits or in some cases a loss for a project a failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results additionally irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant 

litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability product liability criminal liability warranty obligations and other liabilities which to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies which are a significant source of our revenue and profit are subject to various uncertainties restrictions and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities as well as cost controls government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding contracts with the us federal government for example are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for government programs may even be eliminated 

as a result our government clients may reduce the scope or terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues 

page20 

for example those with the us federal government represented approximately 221  of our total revenue in fiscal 2012  a significant reduction in government funding or the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations if the us federal government is unable to agree on a budget by the end of 2012 and the terms of the budget control act of 2011 go into effect it may have a material adverse impact on our business with the us federal government and could potentially cause a more general recession in the us 

most government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process the us federal government has increasingly relied upon multipleyear contacts with multiple contractors that generally require those contractors to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under a contract this process may result in us facing significant additional pricing pressure and uncertainty and incurring additional costs moreover we may not be awarded government contracts because of existing policies designed to protect small businesses and underrepresented minorities our inability to win new contracts or be awarded work under existing contracts could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 

in addition government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socioeconomic requirements which affects how we transact business with our clients and in some instances impose additional costs on our business operations for example for contracts with the us federal government we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation the truth in negotiations act the cost accounting standards the service contract act and numerous regulations governing security environmental protection and employment practices government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than nongovernment contracts this includes for example unlimited indemnification obligations 

we also are subject to government audits investigations and proceedings for example government agencies such as the us defense contract audit agency routinely review and audit us to determine the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies and whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations these audits can result in a determination that a rule or regulation has been violated or that adjustments are necessary to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies 

if we violate a rule or regulation fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit a variety of penalties can be imposed including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties in addition any or all of our government contracts could be terminated we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work or payment of our costs could be disallowed for example in socalled qui tam actions brought by individuals or the government under the us federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws treble damages can be awarded the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

many of our federal government contracts require us to have security clearances which can be difficult and time consuming to obtain if our employees are unable to obtain or retain the necessary securities clearances our clients could terminate or not renew existing contracts or award us new contracts to the extent this occurs our operations and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

we bear the risk of cost overruns in fixedprice contracts we may experience reduced profits or in some cases losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates 

for fiscal 2012  approximately 150  of our revenues were earned under contracts that were fixedprice in nature for these contracts we bear the risk of paying some if not all of any cost overruns fixedprice contract amounts are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions including those about future economic conditions prices and availability of labor equipment and materials and other exigencies if these estimates prove inaccurate there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications or if circumstances change due to among other things unanticipated technical problems difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals changes in local laws or labor conditions weather delays changes in the costs of raw materials or our vendors’ or subcontractors’ inability to perform then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or in some cases a loss for that project if the project is significant or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

page21 

the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted cancelled or suspended by our clients and therefore our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings additionally even if fully performed our backlog may not be a good indicator of our future gross margins 

as of the end of fiscal 2012  our backlog totaled approximately 159 billion  there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or if realized will result in profits in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation termination or suspension at the discretion of the client in addition the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts the revenue for certain contracts included in backlog are based on estimates projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns 

additionally the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence future profitability in some markets there is a continuing trend towards costreimbursable contracts with incentivefee arrangements typically our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs overall safety performance overall client satisfaction and other performance criteria if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards we may receive a lower or even zero incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins accordingly there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog assuming they produce the revenues currently expected will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past 

our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control 

as is common in the industry we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures partnerships and similar arrangements this situation exposes us to a number of risks including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients our partners may also be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships if these circumstances occur we may be required to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages provide additional services or make additional investments to ensure adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services under agreements with joint and several liabilities we could be liable for both our obligations and those of our partners these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner in these cases we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the failure by a joint venture partner to comply with applicable laws regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and for government clients could result in fines penalties suspension or even debarment being imposed on us which could have material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts 

much of the work performed under our contracts is performed by thirdparty subcontractors we hire we also rely on thirdparty equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired if we are not able to locate qualified thirdparty subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated especially in a lumpsum or a fixedprice contract we may suffer losses on these contracts if a subcontractor supplier or manufacturer fails to provide services supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason we may be required to source these services equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms which could impact contract profitability in the current economic environment third parties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party’s ability to provide materials equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition a failure by a third party subcontractor supplier or manufacturer to comply with applicable laws regulations or client requirements could negatively impact our business and for government clients could result in fines penalties suspension or even debarment being imposed on us which could have material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

page22 

maintaining adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win some contracts 

in line with industry practice we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds to our customers these bonds indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract if a bond is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond we cannot pursue that project 

historically we have had adequate bonding and letter of credit capacity but as is typically the case the issuance of a bond is at the surety’s sole discretion and the issuance of a letter of credit is based on the companys credit worthiness because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms our inability to obtain adequate bonding and as a result to bid on new contracts that require such bonding could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we fail to comply with federal state local or foreign governmental requirements our business may be adversely affected 

we are subject to us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business for example we are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities 

various us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants the liability under these laws is joint and several we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen cleanup obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

when we perform our services our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions we may be subject to liability claims by employees customers and third parties as a result of such exposures in addition we may be subject to fines penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws a claim if not covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

such laws regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could for example relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and in turn could negatively impact our revenue our failure to comply with such laws or regulations whether actual or alleged could expose us to fines penalties or potential litigation liabilities including costs settlements and judgments any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments which may require us or our clients to obtain and to comply with federal state and local government permits and approvals any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial revocation or modification under various circumstances failure to obtain or comply with or the loss or modification of the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and result of operations 

our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders although we have policies and procedures to comply with us and foreign international trade laws the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and could damage our reputation and therefore our ability to do business 

employee agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts which could result in reduced revenues and profits 

misconduct fraud noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or other improper activities by one of our 

page23 

employees agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations regulations regarding the protection of classified information regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts regulations on lobbying or similar activities regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting environmental laws and any other applicable laws or regulations for example we routinely provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters if a security breach were to occur our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective and we could face unknown risks or losses our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act of 2010 and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices despite our training and compliance programs there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the loss of or a significant reduction in business from one or a few customers could have an adverse impact on us 

a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue andor backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years for example in fiscal 2012  2011  and fiscal 2010  approximately 221  244  and 254  respectively of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government although we have longstanding relationships with many of our significant clients our clients may unilaterally reduce delay or cancel their contracts at any time our loss of or a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we engage in a highly competitive business if we are unable to compete effectively we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

we face intense competition to provide technical professional and construction services to clients the extent of such competition varies by industry geographic market and project type for example with respect to our construction and operations and maintenance services clients generally award large projects to large contractors which may give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects conversely with respect to our engineering design architectural and consulting services low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller newer competitors if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both which if significant could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our larger competitors for engineering construction and maintenance services for process plants include bechtel fluor foster wheeler kbr technip worleyparsons the shaw group and amec in the area of buildings our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr hok aecom and turner in the area of infrastructure our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as urs parsons brinckerhoff hntb tetra tech parsons and ws atkins in the area of national government programs our principal competitors include several of the competitors listed above as well as saic ch2m hill weston lockheed martin and computer sciences corporation 

in addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in risk factors our international operations are also exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies 

for fiscal 2012  approximately 380  of our revenues was earned from clients outside the us our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues at a minimum our reported financial condition and results of operations 

page24 

are exposed to the effects both positive and negative that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar into the us dollar in addition our international operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

  

 the lack of a welldeveloped legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights in addition military action or continued unrest particularly in the middle east could impact the supply or pricing of oil disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic political and other conditions our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

foreign exchange risks may affect our ability to realize a profit from certain projects 

while we generally attempt to denominate our contracts in the currencies of our expenditures we do enter into contracts that expose us to currency risk particularly to the extent contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs we attempt to minimize our exposure from currency risks by obtaining escalation provisions for projects in inflationary economies or entering into derivative hedging instruments when there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts these actions however may not always eliminate currency risk exposure based on fluctuations in currency the us dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly we may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the financing requirements of our operations in other countries 

our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties 

our business strategy involves growth through among other things the acquisition of other companies acquiring companies presents a number of risks including 

 page25 

 while we often obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses such rights may be difficult to enforce the losses may exceed any dedicated escrow funds and the indemnitors may not have ability to financially support the indemnity 

in addition there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us the credit markets may make it more difficult and costly to finance acquisitions acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 

in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make we could dilute share ownership 

one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities accordingly we filed a shelf registration statement on form s4 on december 7 2007 if we issue additional equity securities pursuant to this shelf registration statement or otherwise such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders’ individual ownership percentages in the company 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock because of a number of factors including 

 our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements 

in preparing our financial statements our management is required under us gaap to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities areas requiring significant estimates by our management include 

 page26 

 our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

an impairment charge of goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

under us gaap we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach as of september 28 2012  we had 20 billion  of goodwill representing 294  of our total assets of 68 billion  we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business potential government actions toward our facilities and other factors 

if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value we could be required to record an impairment charge the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing please see item 7— management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  below 

we may be required to contribute additional cash to meet any underfunded benefit obligations associated with retirement and postretirement benefit plans we manage 

we have various employee benefit plan obligations that require us to make contributions to satisfy over time our underfunded benefit obligations which are generally determined by calculating the projected benefit obligations minus the fair value of plan assets for example as of september 28 2012 and september 30 2011 our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans were projected to be underfunded by 4637 million  and 4210 million  respectively see note 7— pension plans  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k for additional disclosure in the future our benefit plan obligations may increase or decrease depending on changes in the levels of interest rates pension plan asset performance and other factors if we are required to contribute a significant amount of the deficit for underfunded benefit plans our cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

rising inflation interest rates andor construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts in particular with respect to our fixedprice contracts 

rising inflation interest rates or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services in addition we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixedprice because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from costreimbursable type contracts approximately 850  during fiscal 2012  the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor however if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixedprice and lumpsum work is more prevalent inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future therefore increases in inflation interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change 

growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations for example there is a growing consensus that new and additional regulations may be enacted concerning among other things greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased compliance costs for us and our clients legislation international protocols regulation or other restrictions on emissions could also affect our clients including those who are involved in the exploration production or refining of fossil fuels such changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or in some cases prevent a project from going forward thereby potentially reducing the need for our services which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations however these changes could also 

page27 

increase the pace of projects such as carbon capture or storage projects that could have a positive impact on our business we cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers 

our effective tax rate may increase or decrease 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation the introduction of new tax accounting standards legislation regulations and related interpretations our global mix of earnings the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

systems and information technology interruption could adversely impact our ability to operate 

we rely heavily on computer information and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business from time to time we experience occasional system interruptions and delays in the event we are unable to regularly deploy software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems the operation of such systems could be interrupted or result in the loss corruption or release of data in addition our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters telecommunications failures acts of war or terrorism computer viruses physical or electronic security breaches intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error or similar events or disruptions any of these or other events could cause interruptions delays loss of critical andor sensitive data or similar effects which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition protection of intellectual property and results of operations as well as those of our clients 

we may not be able to protect our intellectual property or that of our clients 

our technology and intellectual property provide us in many instances with a competitive advantage although we protect our property through patent registrations license restrictions and similar mechanisms we may not be able to successfully preserve our rights and they could be invalidated circumvented challenged or become obsolete in addition the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the us if we are unable to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights or if there are any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us our ability to differentiate our service offerings could be reduced in addition our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property there is a risk we may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and as a result could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities loss of contracts or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to professional standards duties and statutory obligations on professional reports and opinions we issue which could subject us to monetary damages 

we issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional engineering expertise as well as our other professional credentials that subject us to professional standards duties and obligations regulating the performance of our services for example we issue opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings if a client or another third party alleges that our report or opinion is incorrect or it is improperly relied upon and we are held responsible we could be subject to significant monetary damages 

delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control 

we are a delaware corporation certain antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us in addition certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover for example 

 page28 

these types of provisions as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders accordingly stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend critical accounting policies 

in order to understand better the changes that occur to key elements of our financial condition results of operations and cash flows a reader of this management’s discussion and analysis “mda” should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business performing longterm engineering and constructiontype contracts requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect both the entity’s results of operations and the carrying values of its assets and liabilities although our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 – significant accounting policies  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k the following discussion is intended to highlight and describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue accounting for contracts and use of joint ventures —in general we recognize revenues at the time we provide services depending on the commercial terms of the contract we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred or using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion this method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress as of the balance sheet dates in making such estimates judgments are required to evaluate the possible effects of variances in schedule the costs of materials and labor productivity and the impact of change orders liability claims contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee for contracts containing incentive fee arrangements fees are frequently based on achievement of target completion dates target costs andor other performance criteria failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or nonrecoverable costs which could exceed revenues recognized from the project 

we provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known without regard to the percentage of completion for multiple contracts with a single customer we account for each contract separately 

the nature of our business sometimes results in clients subcontractors or vendors presenting claims to us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible in those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract we include in the total estimated costs of the contract and therefore the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract an estimate based on all relevant facts and circumstances available of the additional costs to be incurred similarly and in the normal course of business we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible in those situations where we have presented such claims to our clients we include in revenues the amount of costs incurred without profit to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims 

certain costreimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment in this situation revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts in those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs that are not allowable under the terms of the contract we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly 

as is common to the industry we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures and consortiums although the joint ventures own and hold the contracts with the clients the services required by the contracts are typically performed by us and our joint venture partners or by other subcontractors under subcontracting agreements with the joint ventures the assets of our joint ventures therefore consist almost entirely of cash and receivables representing amounts due from clients and the liabilities of our joint ventures consist almost entirely of amounts due to the joint venture partners for services provided by the partners to the joint ventures under their individual subcontracts and other subcontractors in general at any given time the equity of our joint ventures represents the undistributed profits earned on contracts the joint ventures hold with clients very few of our joint ventures have employees none of our joint ventures have thirdparty debt or credit facilities our joint ventures therefore are simply mechanisms used to deliver engineering and construction services to clients rarely do they in and of themselves present any risk of loss to us or to our partners separate 

page32 

from those that we would carry if we were performing the contract on our own under us gaap our share of losses associated with the contracts held by the joint ventures if and when they occur has always been reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

in evaluating the companys joint ventures also referred to as variable interest entities or vies for accounting and consolidation purposes we perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether or not the company has a “controlling financial interest” in the vie the company is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a vie if it has i the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and ii the right to receive benefits or obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie in making our qualitative analysis the company assesses each vie to determine those activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and whether the company another entity or multiple entities have the power to direct those activities 

  if we determine that we have the power to direct those activities of the vie that most significantly impact its financial performance and have the right or obligation to receive benefits or absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie then we are the primary beneficiary of the vie and we consolidate the vie if we determine that we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the vie or power is shared by two or more unrelated parties then we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not consolidate the vie 

for the companys unconsolidated joint ventures we use the equity method of accounting the company does not currently participate in any significant vies in which it has a controlling financial interest there were no changes in facts and circumstances in the period that caused the company to reassess the method of accounting for its vies 

accounting for stock issued to employees and others — we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the estimated grantdate fair value of the award we estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors using the blackscholes optionpricing model like all optionpricing models the blackscholes models require the use of highly subjective assumptions including i the expected volatility of the market price of the underlying stock and ii the expected term of the award among others accordingly changes in assumptions and any subsequent adjustments to those assumptions can cause drastically different fair values to be assigned to our stock option awards for restricted stock units containing service and performance conditions with measures external to the company compensation expense is based on the fair value of such units determined using monte carlo simulations due to the uncertainties inherent in the use of assumptions and the results of applying monte carlo simulations the amount of expense recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the effects on our future consolidated financial statements because equity awards tend to vest over several years and additional equity awards may be made in the future 

accounting for pension plans — the accounting for pension plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans’ assets and liabilities these assumptions include discount rates investment returns and projected salary increases among others the actuarial assumptions used in determining the funded statuses of the plans are provided in note 7 – pension plans  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

the expected rates of return on plan assets for fiscal 2013 range from 24 to 85 this compares to a range of 27 to 75 for fiscal 2012 we believe the range of rates selected for fiscal 2013 reflects the longterm returns expected on the plans’ assets considering recent market conditions projected rates of inflation the diversification of the plans’ assets and the expected real rates of market returns the discount rates used to compute plan liabilities were changed from a range of 26 to 59 in fiscal 2011 to a range of 06 to 84 in fiscal 2012 these assumptions represent the company’s best estimate of the rates at which its pension obligations could be effectively settled 

changes in the actuarial assumptions often have a material affect on the values assigned to plan assets and liabilities and the associated pension expense for example if the discount rate used to value the net pension benefit obligation “pbo” at september 28 2012 was higher lower by 05 the pbo would have been lower higher at that date by approximately 1008 million for nonus plans and by approximately 244 million for us plans if the expected return on plan assets was higher lower by 10 the net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2013 would be lower higher by approximately 89 million for nonus plans and by approximately 35 million for us plans differences between actuarial assumptions and actual performance ie actuarial gains and losses that are not recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost in the period in which such differences arise are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are recognized as part of net periodic pension cost in future periods in accordance with us gaap management monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in an effort to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used 

  

page33 

contractual guarantees litigation investigations and insurance — in the normal course of business we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation the guarantees to which we are a party generally relate to project schedules and plant performance most of the litigation in which we are involved has us as a defendant in workers’ compensation personal injury environmental employmentlabor professional liability and other similar lawsuits we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations we have elected however to retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under our insurance programs this situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured and we intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of our contracts 

in accordance with us gaap we record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such guarantees litigation and insurance claims we include any adjustments to such liabilities in our consolidated results of operations 

in addition as a contractor providing services to the us federal government and several of its agencies we are subject to many levels of audits investigations and claims by or on behalf of the us federal government with respect to contract performance pricing costs cost allocations and procurement practices we adjust revenues based upon the amounts we expect to realize considering the effects of any client audits or governmental investigations 

testing goodwill for possible impairment — the goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets is tested annually for possible impairment in performing the annual impairment test we evaluate our goodwill at the reporting unit level we have determined that we have two reporting units which are based on geography we refer to these reporting units internally as “europe” and “noneurope” each of our reporting units conducts the business activities described elsewhere in this 2012 form 10k which includes providing professional technical services such as design engineering and architectural services construction andor construction management services and maintenance and operations services 

our geographybased reporting units reflect the company’s organizational structure which is based predominately on geography as well as our acquisition strategy which favors acquisition targets that among other things provide access to new geographic areas our reporting units represent rational groupings into which substantially all of our major acquisitions which are responsible for the goodwill appearing in our consolidated balance sheet have been assimilated and where all of the operations under each reporting unit share in the benefits of the goodwill created by our acquisitions 

us gaap does not prescribe a specific valuation method for estimating the fair value of reporting units the valuation technique used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions including revenue growth rates operating margins discount rates and future market conditions among others 

for fiscal years 2011 and 2010  we used a market approach for valuing our reporting units under this method the fair value of our reporting units was estimated by multiplying their respective aftertax earnings for the trailing twelve months by the company’s overall average market earnings multiple 

the key inputs used in the valuation model were the aftertax earnings of our reporting units and the company’s marketdriven average earnings multiple the multiples used for fiscal 2011 and 2010 were approximately 18 and 14 respectively 

for fiscal year 2012 we used both an income approach and a market approach to test our goodwill for possible impairment such approaches require us to make estimates and judgments under the income approach fair vale is determined by using the discounted cash flows of our reporting units under the market approach the fair value of our reporting units is determined by reference to guideline companies that are reasonably comparable to our reporting units the fair values are estimated based on the valuation multiples of the invested capital associated with the guideline companies in assessing whether there is an indication that the carrying value of goodwill has been impaired we utilize the results of both valuation techniques and consider the range of fair values indicated the fair values for each reporting unit exceeded the respective book values by over 30 the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units in our testing were 

income approach 

• company financial projections for fiscal years 2012 to 2015 

• weighted average cost of capital of 12 

• residual period growth rate of 3 

page34 

market approach 

with respect to the market approach the company used multiples ranging from 62 to 80 of ebitda generally earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and from 73 to 96 for ebit generally earnings before interest and taxes for guideline publicly traded companies reasonably comparable to the companys reporting units applied to the trailing twelve months results of operations for each of our reporting units 

it is possible that changes in market conditions economy facts and circumstances judgments and assumptions used in estimating the fair value could change resulting in possible impairment of goodwill in the future the fair values resulting from the valuation technique used are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of the reporting units to willing third parties 

the company performs the annual goodwill impairment test for the reporting units in the third quarter of our fiscal year the company will test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount we have determined that the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values for fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 

based on the most recent results of our annual impairment tests there were no indications of impairment of the goodwill shown in our consolidated balance sheets at either september 28 2012 or september 30 2011 

  

fiscal 2012 — overview 

the company’s net earnings increased 479 million  or 145  from 3310 million  for fiscal 2011  to 3790 million  for fiscal 2012  included in net earnings for fiscal 2012 is a onetime aftertax gain of 40 million or 003 per diluted share related to the sale of the companys intellectual property for iron ore pelletizing and other related assets pelletizing gain the sale was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 excluding the pelletizing gain the companys net earnings for fiscal 2012 grew 133 from the prior year 

although any fiscal 2012 information that excludes the pelletizing gain is nonus gaap we use such information in this mda because management believes such information provides a better point of reference for assessing the company’s current financial performance and operating trends 

in spite of the difficult economic environment that continued to plague many of the endmarkets that we serve the company was able to grow net earnings by 133 and revenues by 49 from the prior year this growth was facilitated by increased activity across several of the major markets in which our clients operate including the hydrocarbons business refining and upstream oil and gas chemicals and polymers mining and minerals and pharmaceuticals and biotechnology this growth occurred principally within the technical professional services areas of our business 

 backlog at september 28 2012  increased 162 billion  or 113  to 1591 billion  backlog at september 28 2012  includes new awards from clients operating in the chemicals and polymers oil  gas  upstream and mining and minerals industries and markets

results of operations 

general 

our business focuses exclusively on providing technical professional services and field services to a large number of industrial commercial and governmental clients around the world the services we provide generally fall into four broad categories 

 the scope of services we can provide our clients therefore ranges from consulting and conceptual design services which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project to complete singleresponsibility designbuild contracts to services required in the post startup phases of a project such as maintenance and operations services 

the following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each of the last three fiscal years in thousands 

  



page36 

we focus our services on clients operating in select industry groups and markets we believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit crossutilization of our resources the following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each of the last three fiscal years in thousands 

  

we recorded net earnings of 379 million  or 294  per diluted share 375 million or 291 per diluted share excluding the pelletizing gain for the fiscal year ended september 28 2012  compared to 3310 million  or 260  per diluted share for the fiscal year ended september 30 2011  

revenues increased 5121 million  or 49  from 1038 billion  for fiscal 2011  to 1089 billion  for fiscal 2012  

revenues from clients operating in the chemicals and polymers industries increased 2436 million or 167 from 15 billion for fiscal 2011 to 17 billion for fiscal 2012 the effect of shale gas projects and the low price of natural gas had an impact on the chemicals market in fiscal 2012 because there is now a large source of feedstock available outside refineries which can grow independently of the refining infrastructure we believe more projects are now economically viable and capital is being deployed to develop these opportunities furthermore our clients are looking at various options to monetize natural gas 

revenues from clients operating in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets increased 1716 million or 424 from 4047 million for fiscal 2011 to 5763 million for fiscal 2012 this increase was due primarily to a number of new and continuing projects including projects relating to vaccine production facilities although we view this market as being steady we see growth prospects in the areas of biotechnologybased drug development in europe and north america and for secondary manufacturing expansion in asia and south america 

revenues from clients operating in the refining—downstream market increased 1237 million or 55 from 226 billion for fiscal 2011 to 238 billion for fiscal 2012 the increase was due primarily to higher business volume principally within the companys operations in the us and canada we believe the level of profits realized by our refinery clients will help drive new capital projects particularly as refiners assess possible changes in their crude slate and the need to revamp decadesold facilities to meet changing demand and the continuing effects of recent environmental regulations we believe the refining  downstream market will remain strong in fiscal 2013 

revenues from clients operating in the mining and minerals market increased 1009 million or 225 from 4492 million for fiscal 2011 to 5501 million for fiscal 2012 this increase is due primarily to the inclusion of the revenues of the aker entities for all of fiscal 2012 versus only a portion of fiscal 2011 the aker entities refer to certain businesses that were acquired in separate transactions that were completed in february and april 2011 and which are described in more detail in note 3— business combinations  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k although we see opportunities to grow this business in fiscal 2013 our clients in this market have been affected negatively by falling spot prices for iron ore coking and thermal coal and weaker commodity prices  albeit these declines have occurred from prices that were generally high from a historical perspective further influencing this market is continued european banking instability the weak us recovery and a general slowdown in the chinese economy despite this cooling market we believe that we are well positioned to capture additional market share during fiscal 2013 particularly in the area of smallcap projects and maintenancedriven work 

revenues from clients operating in the oil and gas—upstream market increased 371 million or 49 from 7535 million for fiscal 2011 to 7905 million for fiscal 2012 the canadian oil and gas business continues to improve the company anticipates this market to remain strong during fiscal 2013 projections continue to show a strong oil price forecast 

page37 

which should keep the market moving forward we also anticipate an increase in our field services activities for clients in this market in fiscal 2013 

national government programs revenues for fiscal 2012 remained relatively flat compared to fiscal 2011 we believe that uncertainties associated with sequestration ie that mechanism within the budget control act of 2011 that can trigger automatic us government spending cuts in the event the us congress and the president fail to to agree on a budget by the end of calendar 2012 caused several agencies to slow the release of work in 2012 we believe the impact to the company if any of sequestration should it occur will likely begin in late fiscal 2013 nevertheless certain recent changes in government contracting in the us have helped to stabilize this area of our business and may continue to help stabilize it in the future we have seen an increasing volume of work released by us government agencies in the form of multiple award task order contracts matoc these types of awards allow the company to bid on and participate in more government sites than large singleaward contracts we believe our cost profile makes us very competitive for matoctype awards 

revenues from clients operating in the buildings market decreased 496 million or 55 from 8935 million for fiscal 2011 to 8440 million for fiscal 2012 in general we see a shift in this industry group towards projects for clients in the private sector driven by a continuing decline in government spending growth in the private sector business is coming from mission critical education healthcare aviation and corporate and commercial programs and projects we anticipate continued growth in fiscal 2013 

direct costs of contracts increased 3446 million  or 39  from 882 billion  during fiscal 2011  to 917 billion  during fiscal 2012  direct costs of contracts include all costs incurred in connection with and directly for the benefit of client contracts including depreciation and amortization relating to assets used in connection with providing the services required by client projects the level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors including the amount of passthrough costs we incur during a period on those projects where we are responsible for subcontract labor or thirdparty materials and equipment we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs and we refer to such costs as “passthrough costs” on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not considered passthrough costs and are therefore not reflected in either revenues or costs to the extent that we incur a significant amount of passthrough costs in a period our direct cost of contracts are likely to increase as well 

passthrough costs increased 2099 million  or 99  from 212 billion  during fiscal 2011  to 233 billion  for fiscal 2012  in general passthrough costs are more significant on projects that have a higher content of field services activities field services revenues however decreased 672 million  or 15  from 450 billion  during fiscal 2011  to 443 billion  during fiscal 2012  passthrough costs are generally incurred at a specific point in the lifecycle of a project and are highly dependent on the needs of our individual clients and the nature of the clients’ projects however because we have hundreds of projects which start at various times within a fiscal year the effect of passthrough costs on the level of direct costs of contracts can vary between fiscal years without there being a fundamental or significant change to the underlying business 

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts were 841  for fiscal 2012  compared to 850  for fiscal 2011  the relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided generally speaking the more procurement we do on behalf of our clients ie where we purchase equipment and materials for use on projects andor procure subcontracts in connection with projects and the more field services revenues we have relative to technical professional services revenues the higher the ratio will be of direct costs of contracts to revenues because revenues from passthrough costs typically have lower margin rates associated with them it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in such revenues without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit the decrease in the ratio of direct costs of contracts to revenues in fiscal 2011 as compared to last year was due primarily to improved margins for our project services margins relating to our field services were virtually unchanged 

selling general and administrative sga expenses for fiscal 2012  increased by 903 million  or 87  to 113 billion  compared to 104 billion  for fiscal 2011  these increases were due primarily to the sga expenses attributable to acquired businesses 

operating profit was 5961 million  for the fiscal year ended september 28 2012  compared to 5189 million  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2011  as a percentage of revenues operating profit was 55  for fiscal 2012  compared to 50  in fiscal 2011  improved margins for our project services contributed to this increase 

interest income during fiscal 2012 increased 11 million as compared to the prior year contributing to this 

page38 

increase was higher average cash balances on deposit in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 

interest expense for fiscal 2012 increased 29 million as compared to fiscal 2011 interest expense in both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 was due primarily to the debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of the aker entities the increase is due primarily to the inclusion of interest expense associated with acquisition indebtedness for all of fiscal 2012 versus only a portion of fiscal 2011 

the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate was 341 for fiscal 2012 compared to 351 in fiscal 2011 in general the lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 is due to the changing geographical source of our earnings combined with an increase in the utilization of us foreign tax credits in the normal course of our business we may engage in numerous transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in income or deducted as an expense is uncertain additionally we file income franchise gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service most states in the us and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the us we continually monitor the appropriateness of the rate and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will change 

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

the most significant event that affects the comparability of the company’s consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2010 was the loss recorded last year in connection with the sivom judgment 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2010 we received an unfavorable court judgment relating to a waste incineration project in france for the sivom de mulhousienne the “sivom judgment” the sivom project was performed by a consortium of contractors that was led by one of our subsidiaries under a contract that was entered into in 1996 prior to our acquisition of that subsidiary as a result of the judgment we recorded a pretax charge to earnings of approximately 933 million net of the effects of the charge on the company’s longterm incentive bonus plan and income taxes the effect on net earnings attributable to jacobs for the fiscal year ended october 1 2010 was approximately 603 million or 048 per diluted share 

because of the unusual nature of the sivom judgment we include in certain places within this mda a discussion of the company’s consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2011 as it compares to fiscal 2010 both with and without the effects of the sivom judgment although any fiscal 2010 information that excludes the effects of the sivom judgment is nonus gaap it is presented because management believes such information provides a better point of reference for assessing the company’s current financial performance and operating trends 

the following table reconciles the company’s fiscal 2010 consolidated results of operations presented in accordance with us gaap to its fiscal 2010 consolidated results of operations excluding the effects of the sivom judgment in thousands except earnings per share 

  



we recorded net earnings of 3310 million or 260 per diluted share for the fiscal year ended september 30 2011 compared to 2460 million or 196 per diluted share for the fiscal year ended october 1 2010 excluding the effects of the sivom judgment net earnings and earnings per share for fiscal 2010 were 3063 million and 244 respectively 

revenues increased 4661 million or 47 from 99 billion for fiscal 2010 to 104 billion for fiscal 2011 revenues from clients operating in the mining and minerals markets increased significantly during fiscal 2011 due primarily to 

page39 

the acquisition of the aker entities revenues from clients for infrastructure projects increased 2807 million or 299 from 9390 million for fiscal 2010 to 12 billion for fiscal 2011 contributing to this increase were higher project services revenues for various transportation projects in the us combined with revenues attributable to the aker entities revenues from clients operating in the chemicals  polymers markets increased 2578 million or 214 from 12 billion for fiscal 2010 to 15 billion for fiscal 2011 revenues from clients operating in the oil  gas – upstream markets increased 1940 million or 347 from 5595 million for fiscal 2010 to 7535 million for fiscal 2011 contributing to this increase were several large epc projects performed in north america 

direct costs of contracts increased 2393 million or 28 from 86 billion during fiscal 2010 to 88 billion during fiscal 2011 passthrough costs decreased 6048 million or 222 from 27 billion during fiscal 2010 to 21 billion for fiscal 2011 field services revenues decreased 3067 million or 64 from 48 billion during fiscal 2010 to 45 billion during fiscal 2011 

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts were 850 for fiscal 2011 compared to 866 for fiscal 2010 the decrease in the ratio of direct costs of contracts to revenues in fiscal 2011 as compared to last year was due primarily to lower levels of passthrough costs 

sga expenses for fiscal 2011 increased by 1081 million or 116 to 104 billion compared to 9325 million for fiscal 2010 the aker entities contributed 1130 million inclusive of due diligence and integration costs of sga expenses for the fiscal year ended september 30 2011 excluding the sga expenses of the aker entities sga expenses for fiscal 2011 decreased by 49 million compared to fiscal 2010 the decrease in sga expenses during fiscal 2011 was due primarily to management’s efforts to reduce sga expenses 

operating profit was 5189 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2011 compared to 4001 million 4783 million before the effects of the sivom judgment for the fiscal year ended october 1 2010 as a percentage of revenues operating profit was 50 for fiscal 2011 compared to 40 in fiscal 2010 48 before the effects of the sivom judgment 

even though the company maintained significant cash balances during fiscal 2011 the rate of interest earned on our deposits and investments remained low in fiscal 2011 

interest expense for fiscal 2011 decreased 11 million as compared to fiscal 2010 excluding the effects of the sivom judgment interest expense for fiscal 2011 increased 88 million as compared to fiscal 2010 the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2011 was due primarily to the debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of the aker entities interest expense in fiscal 2010 included the reversal of 29 million of interest expense that was accrued over a number of years in connection with an income tax matter that was resolved successfully 

the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate was 351 for fiscal 2011 compared to 372 in fiscal 2010 the tax rate in fiscal 2011 decreased from fiscal 2010 due to a change in the mix of international work and the successful resolution of a us domestic tax issue

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth certain information about our contractual obligations as of september 28 2012 in thousands 

  



  

 backlog 

backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us with respect to om contracts however we include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for only one succeeding year regardless of the remaining life of the contract for national government programs other than us federal om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding option periods 

the following table summarizes our backlog for each of the last three fiscal years in millions   



the entire value of contract awards are added to backlog when the contracts are awarded to us accordingly backlog can fluctuate from one reporting period to the next due to the timing of when new contracts are added to backlog and when the contract revenue is recognized in our consolidated financial statements many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years our backlog at september 28 2012  increased by 16 billion  or 113  to 159 billion  from 143 billion  at september 30 2011  the increase in backlog from september 30 2011 to september 28 2012 was due primarily to new awards from clients operating in the chemicals and polymers oil  gas—upstream and mining and minerals industries and markets 

page41 

in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client in a situation where a client terminates a contract we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and in certain instances we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs there were no significant project cancellations in fiscal 2012  

while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein accordingly backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenues 

  

backlog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies totaled approximately 36 billion or 229 of total backlog 36 billion or 249 of total backlog and 43 billion or 326 of total backlog at september 28 2012 september 30 2011 and october 1 2010 respectively most of our federal contracts require that services be provided beyond one year in general these contracts must be funded annually ie the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the us congress to the procuring agency and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts 

subject to the factors discussed in item 1a— risk factors  above we estimate that approximately 86 billion or 540 of total backlog at september 28 2012 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year 

effects of inflation 

the effects of inflation on our business is discussed in item 1a— risk factors  and is incorporated herein by reference 

liquidity and capital resources 

at september 28 2012  our primary sources of liquidity consisted of 103 billion  of cash and cash equivalents and 6646 million  of available borrowing capacity under our 121 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility we finance as much of our operations and growth as possible through cash generated by our operations 

during fiscal 2012  our cash and cash equivalents increased by 1268 million  from 9056 million at september 30 2011 to 103 billion  at september 28 2012  this compares to a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 332 million  during the corresponding period last year during fiscal 2012 our operating activities contributed 2998 million  of cash and cash equivalents and the effects of exchange rate changes added another 109 million  these increases in cash flows were offset in part by net cash uses of 1811 million  for investing activities and 27 million  for financing activities 

operations provided net cash of 2998 million  during fiscal 2012  this compares to net cash inflows of 2365 million  and 2236 million  during fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively the 633 million  increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011 was due primarily to a 557 million  increase in net earnings attributable to the group and a 229 million  favorable change in the companys working capital accounts offset in part by a 169 million  change relating to deferred income taxes 

because such a high percentage of our revenues are earned on costplus type contracts and due to the significance of revenues relating to passthrough costs most of the costs we incur are included in invoices we send to clients although we continually monitor our accounts receivable we manage the operating cash flows of the company by managing the working capital accounts in total rather than by the individual elements the primary elements of the company’s working capital accounts are accounts receivable accounts payable and billings in excess of cost accounts payable consists of obligations to third parties relating primarily to costs incurred for projects which are generally billable to clients accounts receivable consist of billings to our clients — a substantial portion of which is for projectrelated costs billings in excess of cost consist of billings to and payments from our clients for costs yet to be incurred 

this relationship between revenues and costs and between receivables and payables is unique to our industry and facilitates review of our liquidity at the total working capital level the changes in cash flows relating to our working capital accounts were due simply to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts and is not indicative of any known trend or fundamental change to the underlying business there were only minor changes within the components of our working capital accounts during fiscal 2012 when compared to fiscal 2011 we still continue to experience delays in certain payments and have seen an increase in the length of payment terms with certain customers we believe that this situation does not present a significant risk to the companys cash flows we believe the risk of not collecting substantially all of the companys outstanding receivables is remote though the company provides services in a number of countries outside the us we believe our credit risk is not significant our private sector customers are comprised principally of large well 

page42 

known and well established multinational companies our government customers are comprised of national state and local agencies located principally in the us and the uk we have not historically experienced significant collection issues with either of our governmental or nongovernmental customers furthermore our largest government customer in the uk provides advance payments to the company 

  

we used 1811 million  of cash and cash equivalents for investing activities during fiscal 2012  this compares to 8018 million  and 3985 million  during fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively the 6207 million  decrease in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011 was due to to a decline in merger and acquisition activity 

additions to property and equipment totaled 1026 million  987 million  and 491 million  for fiscal years 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively included in fiscal 2012 activity are significant expenditures for system software and hardware upgrades relating principally to the businesses we recently acquired and leasehold improvements relating primarily to the consolidation of certain office space in one major market in the us and the expansion of office space in several locations in the us and overseas included in the fiscal 2011 activity was a 491 million addition to property plant and equipment related to the purchase of an office building we use in our operations and the associated equipment and furniture 

our financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 27 million  during fiscal 2012  this compares to net cash inflows of 5569 million  and 931 million  during fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively the 5597 million  net decrease in cash flows from financing activities during fiscal 2012  as compared to fiscal 2011 was due primarily to the overall higher level of borrowing activity that occurred last year in support of the companys merger and acquisition activity 

the company had 103 billion  of cash and short term equivalents at september 28 2012  of this amount approximately 7795 million was held in the us and 2530 million was held outside of the us primarily in canada the united kingdom the eurozone and australia other than the tax cost of repatriating funds held outside the us to the us see note 9— income taxes  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k there are no impediments to repatriating these funds to the us 

on march 29 2012 the company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a 121 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility the 2012 facility with a syndicate of large us domestic and international banks and financial institutions the 2012 facility replaces and refinances the companys previous revolving credit facility originally entered into by the company on december 15 2005 the 2005 facility effective with the closing of the 2012 facility all commitments under the 2005 facility were terminated and were refinanced under the 2012 facility the total amount utilized under the 2012 facility at september 28 2012  was 5404 million   5283 million  in the form of direct borrowings and 121 million  utilized in the form of letters of credit the 2012 facility has a five year maturity please refer to note 6— borrowings of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding the 2012 facility 

we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations support our acquisition strategy and service our debt for the next twelve months we had 103 billion  in cash and cash equivalents at september 28 2012  compared to 9056 million  at september 30 2011  our consolidated working capital position at september 28 2012  was 187 billion  an increase of 8535 million  from september 30 2011  contributing to this increase in working capital in fiscal 2012 was the refinancing of 5660 million of shortterm debt under the the 2012 facility 

additionally there was 6646 million  of borrowing capacity available at september 28 2012  under the 2012 facility we believe that the remaining capacity terms and conditions of our revolving credit facility combined with cash onhand and the other committed and uncommitted facilities we have in place are adequate for our working capital and general business requirements 

the company had 2249 million  of letters of credit outstanding at september 28 2012  of this amount 121 million   had been issued under the 2012 facility and 2127 million  were issued under separate committed and uncommitted letterofcredit facilities 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are party to financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk in the form of guarantees not reflected in our balance sheet that arise in the normal course of business however such offbalance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or resources that is material to investors see note 10 – commitments and contingencies and derivative financial instruments  of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act management with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the evaluation date based on the framework established in “ internal control—integrated framework”  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management has concluded that the company’s internal controls over financial reporting as of the evaluation date were effective the company’s independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting which appears later in this annual report on form 10k 

changes in internal control 

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the company’s fiscal quarter ended september 28 2012  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

page45 

limitations on effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its system of internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed or operated can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of internal control are met the design of the company’s control system reflects the fact that there are resource constraints and that the benefits of such control system must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control failures and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the intentional acts of individuals by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that the design of any particular control will always succeed in achieving its objective under all potential future conditions

business strategy 

general 

there are four major components of our business strategy 

 

  

  

  

 acquisitions play an important role in our business strategy as they allow us to expand on existing client relationships as well as develop new ones acquisitions also allow us to grow our technical and project management capabilities to penetrate new geographies and to leverage our cost structure across geographic areas 

safety and beyondzero ® 

most companies in our industry try to provide their employees with a safe and secure work environment they create safety programs require employee training and make every effort to build awareness we do this too but we see safety differently 

in 2007 we introduced beyondzero ®  a companywide initiative designed to educate and train our employees and to instill in them a “culture of caring” that follows them outside of the workplace or jobsite beyondzero ® inspires our organization to a deeper richer emotional commitment to the safety of our employees their families their clients partners and friends and beyond 

providing an injuryfree and incidentfree work environment is a critical element of the relationship we have with our employees and subcontractors it is also a paramount issue in our dealings with our clients and our safety program and beyondzero ® are fundamental elements of our overall approach to risk management a safe work environment is critical to our longterm success and growth 

we maintain a centralized quality and safety group to help ensure that the services we provide are delivered safely and in accordance with standard work processes unsafe job sites and office environments increase employee turnover increase the cost of projects to our clients expose us to types and levels of risk that are fundamentally unacceptable and increase our own operating costs as well 

with beyondzero ® we have developed a culture of caring where concern for our employees’ health and safety extends past office walls beyond field sites and past the perception that injured employees simply cost the company time and money it’s about safekeeping ultimately safe job sites and office environments benefit our clients promote employee morale and enhance the longterm relationships we have with our clients employees and business partners 

relationshipbased business model 

our relationshipbased business model is central to our sustained growth and profitability we aggressively pursue the development of longterm affiliations and alliances with our clients by working as a partner with our clients on their capital programs we increase our understanding of their overall business needs as well as the unique technical requirements of their projects this increased understanding gives us the opportunity to provide superior value to our clients we market all of our services to clients in connection with their projects where the scope of work required is within our expertise by integrating and bundling our services ie providing design engineering and construction services on the same project we can price contracts more competitively and enhance overall profitability while delivering additional value to our clients 

our relationshipbased business model also helps us more fully understand the risks inherent in our projects which in turn allows us to better manage those risks our approach also provides us with opportunities to market those services our clients are 

  

page 4 

expected to need in the predesign phase such as master planning permitting or project finance options and also the post startup and commissioning phases of a facility such as operations and maintenance services this model however does not preclude us from undertaking discrete projects we will accept and perform discrete projects for our clients if we can negotiate acceptable pricing and other contract terms and conditions 

closely linked to our relationshipbased business model is our multidomestic geographic strategy for conducting business around the world as part of this strategy we act and operate as a local contractor in geographic areas of the world in which we do business we believe it is important for us as a company to “be local” with respect to our network of offices and operations because our offices can generally sustain themselves with a base load of local work we are able to support our multinational clients with their crossborder capital projects our core clients can depend on us for assistance with their engineering and construction needs when they move projects around the world our multidomestic strategy also allows us to be competitive around the world to the extent we are awarded large projects and are able to perform meaningful portions of the project utilizing local resources rather than exporting the work to other offices within the group 

cost management 

our continual emphasis on managing costs is an important component of our business model as the global economy expands and companies providing technical professional and construction services are required to compete against each other across geographic boundaries the company that can provide its clients with costefficient solutions to their project needs has the advantage our attention to cost control throughout every level of our organization allows us to deliver superior technical professional and construction services safely efficiently and within the cost and time parameters our clients require 

organizational structure and resource sharing 

our organizational structure and integrated system for delivering services are key components of our business strategy our operating units generally use a matrix organizational structure whereby our project management functions are supported by the various technical engineering design and construction disciplines that are necessary to effectively execute longterm engineering and construction contracts crucial functions such as project controls and procurement are embedded within each of our major offices and serve operations by providing specialized services required by projects in addition we actively employ a boundaryless approach to the way we serve our clients we do not maintain “profit centers” within the company nor do our operating groups compete against each other for contracts instead our organizational structure encourages our operating groups to work cohesively while simultaneously helping to reduce costs and promote an efficient delivery system for all of our services 

the role of acquisitions in our business strategy 

our relationshipbased business model is a significant driver of our acquisition strategy when we review potential acquisition targets we are conscious of the effect the acquisition may have on our client base we favor acquisitions that allow us to expand or enhance the range of services we provide existing clients andor gain access to new geographic areas in which our clients either already operate or plan to expand by expanding into new geographic areas and adding to our existing technical and project management capabilities we strive to position ourselves as a preferred singlesource provider of technical professional and construction services to our major clients the following is a brief description of some of our recent key acquisitions 

 

  

  

   

page 5 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in any particular year we will also make smaller acquisitions as opportunities arise with respect to all of our acquisitions we move very quickly to integrate our operations postclosing we typically assign senior operations personnel to manage the overall integration process with assistance from our sales accounting legal it human resources and risk management departments although integrating newly acquired businesses can be very challenging the assimilation process is critical in order to assure i that our global businesses processes and systems are properly deployed throughout the newlyacquired entities and ii we can begin to leverageoff the acquired talents skills and expertise to grow our business and help our clients execute their capital programs newlyacquired businesses are not left as standalone entities within the company’s internal reporting system the businesses we acquire are typically foldedin within existing operational organizations within the company 

  

page 6 

services provided 

as described above the services we provide generally fall into the following four broad categories project services process scientific and systems consulting services construction services and operations and maintenance services the scope of services we can provide our clients therefore ranges from consulting and conceptual design services which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project to complete singleresponsibility designbuildoperate contracts 

the following table sets forth our revenues from each of our four service categories for each of the last five fiscal years in thousands of dollars 

 

 project services 

we employ all of the engineering architectural interiors design planning and related disciplines necessary to design and engineer modern process plants including projects for clients in the chemicals and polymers pharmaceuticals and biotechnology upstream oil  gas refining food and consumer products mining and minerals and other basic resources industries buildings including facilities for clients in the healthcare education and criminal justice markets as well as other specialized buildings for clients in the private sector infrastructure projects including highways roads bridges and other transportation systems water and wastewater treatment plants water resources facilities and other similar plants and facilities technology and manufacturing facilities for clients in the aerospace automotive defense semiconductor and electronics industries consumer products manufacturing facilities power plants and stations pulp and paper plants and other facilities 

we are capable of providing our clients with a variety of value engineering services including “safety in design” through safety in design we integrate best practices hazard analysis and risk assessment methods early in the design phase of projects taking those steps necessary to eliminate or mitigate injury and damage during the construction startup testing and commissioning and operations phases of a project 

in the area of construction management we provide our clients with a wide range of services as an agent for our clients we may act as the program director whereby we oversee on the owner’s behalf the complete planning design and construction phases of the project alternatively our services may be limited to providing construction consulting 

also included in the category of project services are certain related services such as planning scheduling procurement estimating cost engineering project accounting and quality and safety necessary to support our engineering design construction construction and program management operations and maintenance and consulting services 

process scientific and systems consulting services 

we employ all of the professional and technical skills and expertise with respect to a broad range of consulting services including performing pricing studies market analyses and financial projections necessary in determining the feasibility of a project performing gasoline reformulation modeling analyzing and evaluating layout and mechanical designs for complex processing plants analyzing automation and control systems analyzing designing and executing biocontainment strategies developing and performing process protocols with respect to the us food and drug administrationmandated qualification and validation requirements providing consultation on proposed railway and airport expansion projects and performing geological and metallurgical studies 

also included in this service category are the revenues relating to professional and program management services required to assist clients such as the us federal government and its agencies in a wide range of defense and aerospacerelated programs such services typically are more technical and scientific in nature than other project services we provide and may involve such tasks as supporting the development and testing of conventional weapons systems weapons modeling and simulations computer systems development maintenance and support evaluation and testing of missioncritical control systems aerospace testing and propulsion systems and facilities and other highly technical programs and tasks 

  

page 7 

construction services 

we provide traditional field construction services to private and public sector clients in virtually all of the industry groups and markets to which we provide project services in the area of environmental remediation and restoration we provide environmental remedial construction services for a variety of public and private sector clients we also provide many of our clients with modular construction technology our modular construction technology is an advanced form of engineering and design offsite fabrication and assembly and field erection it provides our clients with an alternative approach to traditional methods of engineering and construction which can compress and shorten the construction schedule reduce risk and lower costs 

historically our field construction activities were focused primarily on those construction projects for which we perform much of the related engineering and design work by focusing our construction efforts on such projects we minimize the risks associated with constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared by third parties the financial risk to us of constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared by third parties may be particularly significant on fixedprice contracts therefore we generally avoid this type of project however we will pursue constructiononly projects when we can negotiate pricing and other contract terms we deem acceptable and which we believe will result in a fair return for the degree of risk we assume 

operations and maintenance “om” services 

om generally refers to all of the tasks required to operate and maintain large complex facilities on behalf of clients we can provide key management and support services over all aspects of the operations of a facility including managing subcontractors and other onsite personnel within the environmental area om often includes engineering and technical support services as well as program management services necessary to remediate contaminated sites within the aerospace and defense areas om often requires us to provide the management and technical support services necessary to operate and maintain such sites as engine test facilities weapons integration facilities and hightech simulation and verification centers such om contracts also frequently require us to provide facilities management and maintenance services utilities operations and maintenance services property management and disposition services and construction support services 

om also includes process plant maintenance services which generally involves all of the tasks required to keep a process plant typically a refinery or chemical plant in daytoday operation such tasks could include the repair and replacement of pumps piping heat exchangers and other equipment as well as “turnaround” work which involves major refurbishment that can only be performed when the plant is shut down since shutdowns are expensive to the owners of the plant turnaround work often requires maximizing the number of skilled craft personnel who can work efficiently on a project on a 24hourperday sevendayperweek basis we use sophisticated computer scheduling and programming to complete turnaround projects quickly and we maintain contact with a large pool of skilled craft personnel we can hire as needed on maintenance and turnaround projects 

although the gross profit margins we realize from om services are generally lower than those associated with the other services we provide the costs to support maintenance activities are also generally lower furthermore although engineering and construction projects may be of a shortterm nature om services often result in longterm relationships with clients for example we have been providing maintenance services at several major process plants within the us for several decades this aspect of maintenance services greatly reduces the selling costs in respect of such services 

financial information about segments 

although we describe our business in this annual report on form 10k in terms of the various services we provide the markets in which our clients operate and the geographic areas in which we operate we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the us “us gaap” in making this determination we considered the various economic characteristics of our operations including the nature of the services we provide the nature of our internal processes for delivering and distributing those services and the types of customers we have in addition to the discussion that follows please refer to note 14 — segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

there is a high degree of similarity among the workforces employed across the categories of services we provide for example professionals in engineering and design services ie services provided by persons who are degreed and in certain circumstances licensed such as engineers architects scientists and economists exist in all four service categories in addition there is a high degree of similarity among a significant component of the workforces we employ to perform construction and om projects in providing construction and om services we employ a large number of skilled craft labor personnel these may include welders pipe fitters electricians crane operators and other personnel who work on very large capital projects in the case of projects classified within the construction services category or on smaller capital projects in the case of maintenance projects classified within the om services category 

  

page 8 

our operating units use a matrix organizational structure our results therefore are dependent on groups representing technical disciplines eg electrical engineering mechanical engineering cost engineering etc and supporting project management personnel who maintain the relationship between our clients and us who are ultimately responsible for delivering projects to our clients safely on time and on budget additionally all of our operating regions use common tools policies and procedures to manage and run their respective units these include project review meetings project performance evaluations and project execution plans 

the use of technology throughout our organization is highly uniform whether it is computeraided design and drafting “cadd” applications used by our engineering and design staff or modeling programs used by the scientific and consulting staff or scheduling estimating and cost control applications used by homeoffice personnel in support of our construction and maintenance activities all of the service categories described above are equally affected by changes in technology as they occur in the economy at large 

furthermore the types of information and internal reports used by the company’s chief operating decision maker the “codm” who is also the company’s chief executive officer and other members of management to monitor performance evaluate results of operations allocate resources and otherwise manage the business support a single reportable segment accordingly based on these similarities we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment for purposes of the disclosures included in this annual report on form 10k 

industry groups and markets 

we market our services to all clients where the scope of work required by their capital projects and programs is within our expertise we offer fullservice consulting planning engineering architecture design construction field services construction management modular fabrication procurement project management asset management operations and maintenance services to our clients worldwide within each market we may offer specialty services unique to the sector or services which differentiate us from our competitors in the marketplace

backlog 

backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us with respect to om contracts however we include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for only one succeeding year regardless of the remaining life of the contract for national government programs other than us federal om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding option periods in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation termination or suspension at the discretion of the client in addition the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts our backlog includes expected revenues for contracts that are based on estimates for information regarding our backlog including those risk factors specific to backlog please refer to item 1a — risk factors  and item 7 — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  below

significant customers 

the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government for each of the last five fiscal years 

 



it is uncommon for a commercial customer to contribute 10 or more of the company’s total revenues on occasion however we will perform a number of field services projects for a single customer in the same fiscal year which primarily because of the amount of passthrough costs discussed below that is included in revenue will cause total revenue from that customer to exceed 10 of total consolidated revenues for the fiscal year ended october 2 2009 revenues earned from motiva enterprises llc accounted for 122 of total consolidated revenues 

financial information about geographic areas 

selected financial information regarding the geographic areas in which we operate is included in note 14 — segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k and is incorporated herein by reference 

contracts 

while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake our contracts generally fall into three broad categories costreimbursable fixedprice and guaranteed maximum price the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the last five fiscal years 

 

 in accordance with industry practice most of our contracts including those with the us federal government are subject to termination at the discretion of the client which is discussed in greater detail in item 1a — risk factors  in such situations our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination 

when we are directly responsible for engineering design procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client’s plant or facility we reflect the costs of materials equipment and subcontracts in both revenues and costs on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs the following table sets forth the approximate amount of such passthrough costs included in revenues for each of the last five fiscal years in millions of dollars 

 



costreimbursable contracts 

costreimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit the profit element may be in the form of a simple markup applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee or a combination of a markup and a fee the fee element can also take several forms the fee may be a fixed amount as specified in the contract it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred or it may be an incentive fee based on targets milestones or performance factors defined in the contract in general we prefer costreimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price 

fixedprice contracts 

fixedprice contracts include both “lump sum bid” contracts and “negotiated fixedprice” contracts under lump sum bid contracts we typically bid against other contractors based on specifications the client furnishes this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period additionally it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an 

  

page 15 

adversarial relationship with clients which is contrary to our relationshipbased business model accordingly lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract in contrast under a negotiated fixedprice contract we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client negotiated fixedprice contracts frequently exist in singleresponsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project thus although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us however because of economies that may be realized during the contract term both negotiated fixedprice and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts over the past five years most of our fixedprice work has been either negotiated fixedprice contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services rather than turnkey construction 

guaranteed maximum price contracts 

guaranteed maximum price contracts are performed in the same manner as costreimbursable contracts however the total actual cost plus the fee cannot exceed the guaranteed price negotiated with the client if the total actual cost of the contract exceeds the guaranteed maximum price then we will bear at least some if not all of the excess in those cases where the total actual cost and fee are less than the guaranteed price we will often share the savings on a predetermined basis with the client these contracts are not our preferred form of contract because we believe they often contribute to an adversarial relationship with clients which is contrary to our relationshipbased business model

 item 1a risk factors tableend we operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future we may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial if any such events actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces if we fail to maintain safe work sites we can be exposed to significant financial losses as well as civil and criminal liabilities 

construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment moving vehicles chemical and manufacturing processes and highly regulated materials on many sites we are responsible for safety and accordingly must implement safety procedures if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective our employees and others may become injured unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover increase the cost of a project to our clients and raise our operating costs any of the foregoing could result in financial losses which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials which if improperly handled or disposed of could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health safety and environmental “hse” work procedures throughout our organization including construction sites and maintenance sites the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability 

our safety record is critical to our reputation many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures as a result our failure to maintain adequate safety standards could result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

negative conditions in the credit and financial markets could impair our ability to operate our business implement our acquisition strategy and access our cash and shortterm investments it could also adversely affect our customers’ businesses 

although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions in addition some of our clients depend of the availability of credit to help finance their capital projects due to the continuing instability of the credit markets in the us and abroad the availability of credit has continued to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain in spite of government efforts to stabilize the credit markets this situation could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to access funds refinance our existing indebtedness much of which is scheduled to expire in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 enter into agreements for new indebtedness or obtain funding through the issuance of securities or such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us in addition these market conditions could negatively impact our clients’ ability to fund their projects and therefore utilize our services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors suppliers and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements on less favorable terms with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of 

  

page 17 

services to our clients these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are therefore subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices in weak economic environments we may experience increased delays and failures due to among other reasons a diminution in our clients’ access to the credit markets if one or more clients delays in paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

furthermore our cash balances and shortterm investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america europe south america and asia some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership or have been seized by their governments there is a risk that this may occur in the future if this were to occur we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund operations 

our vulnerability to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our clients operate is exacerbated during economic downturns 

we provide technical professional construction and om services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration production and refining programs for various national governments including the us federal government chemicals and polymers mining and minerals pharmaceuticals and biotechnology infrastructure buildings and other general industrial and consumer businesses and markets such as technology and manufacturing pulp and paper and food and consumer products these markets and the resulting demand for our services have been and we expect will continue to be cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control including economic conditions and changes in client spending particularly during periods of economic uncertainty 

current global economic conditions have negatively impacted our clients’ ability and willingness to fund their projects they have also caused our clients to reduce their capital expenditures alter the mix of services purchased seek more favorable price and other contract terms and otherwise slow their spending on our services for example in the public sector declines in state tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending in addition due to these conditions many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in contracts that we might not deem acceptable these conditions have reduced the demand for our services which has had a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations 

current economic conditions also make it extremely difficult for our clients our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could cause businesses to continue to slow spending on our services we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery worldwide or in our clients’ markets in addition our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and therefore may not recover as quickly as the economy at large a continuation or worsening of current weak economic conditions or a reduction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

regardless of economic or market conditions investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients’ markets and investment decisions as a result our past results have varied considerably and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate 

fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customers’ investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation delays in existing work or changes in the timing and funding of new awards 

commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways for example for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil gas copper or fertilizers fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and therefore their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments to the extent our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects the demand for our services decreases which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned as well as those in progress and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

page 18 

our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel 

the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel including engineers architects designers craft personnel and corporate management professionals who have the required experience and expertise from time to time it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients in certain geographic areas for example we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel 

in addition as some of our key personnel approach retirement age we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the cost of providing our services including the extent to which we utilize our workforce affects our profitability for example the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts if an expected contract award is delayed or not received we could incur cost resulting from excess staff reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business financial conditions and results of operations 

the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the nature of our business sometimes results in clients subcontractors and vendors presenting claims to us for among other things recovery of costs related to certain projects similarly we occasionally present change orders and other claims to our clients subcontractors and vendors if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients subcontractors and vendors we could incur cost overruns reduced profits or in some cases a loss for a project additionally irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant 

we are a party to litigation in the normal course of business most litigation with which we are involved as a defendant relates to workers’ compensation personal injury environmental employmentlabor professional liability and similar matters we can be exposed to claims and litigation if for example there is a failure at any of the projects for which we have provided engineering or other services such claims could relate to among other things personal injury loss of life business interruption property damage pollution and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties such as those who use or reside near our clients’ projects we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards or satisfy certain technical requirements and those standards or requirements are not met in many of our contracts with clients subcontractors and vendors we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages penalties losses and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts 

we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations our insurance programs have varying coverage limits and maximums in addition we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under these programs as a result we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured our insurers are also subject to business risk and as a result one or more of them may be unable to fulfill their insurance obligations due to insolvency or otherwise 

pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability product liability criminal liability warranty obligations and other liabilities which to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties restrictions and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities as well as cost controls government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding contracts with the us federal government for example are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for government programs may even be eliminated as a result our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice in addition the us federal government has announced its intention to scale back outsourcing of services in favor of “insourcing” jobs to its employees this practice and its adoption by other government entities could reduce the size and scope of contracts awarded to us since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues for example those with the us federal government represented approximately 

  

page 19 

244 of our total revenue in fiscal 2011 a significant reduction in government funding eg as a result of the efforts of the us congress joint select committee on deficit reduction or the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition since government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socioeconomic requirements we must comply with such requirements for example for contracts with the us federal government we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation the truth in negotiations act the cost accounting standards the service contract act and dod security regulations we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices environmental protection recordkeeping and accounting these regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and in some instances impose additional costs on our business operations government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than nongovernment contracts this includes for example unlimited indemnification obligations 

we also are subject to government audits investigations and proceedings and socalled “qui tam” actions brought by individuals or the government under the us federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws for example government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations these audits can result in adjustments to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies 

if we violate a rule or regulation fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit a variety of penalties can be imposed including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties in addition any or all of our government contracts could be terminated we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work or payment of our costs could be disallowed the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we bear the risk of cost overruns in fixedprice and guaranteed maximum price contracts we may experience reduced profits or in some cases losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates 

for fiscal 2011 approximately 19 of our revenues were earned under contracts that were either fixedprice or guaranteed maximum price in nature for these contracts we bear the risk of paying some if not all of any cost overruns under fixedprice and guaranteed maximumprice contracts contract prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions including those about future economic conditions prices and availability of labor equipment and materials and other exigencies if these estimates prove inaccurate there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications or if circumstances change due to among other things unanticipated technical problems difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals changes in local laws or labor conditions weather delays changes in the costs of raw materials or our vendors’ or subcontractors’ inability to perform then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or in some cases a loss for that project if the project is significant or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted cancelled or suspended by our clients and therefore our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings additionally even if fully performed our backlog may not be a good indicator of our future gross margins 

as of the end of fiscal 2011 our backlog totaled approximately 143 billion there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or if realized will result in profits in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation termination or suspension at the discretion of the client in addition the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts the revenue for certain contracts included in backlog are based on estimates projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns 

additionally the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence future profitability in some markets there is a continuing trend towards costreimbursable contracts with incentivefee arrangements typically our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs overall safety performance overall client satisfaction and other performance criteria if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards we may receive a lower or even zero incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins accordingly there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog assuming they produce the revenues currently expected will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past 

  

page 20 

our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control 

as is common in the industry we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures partnerships and similar arrangements this situation exposes us to a number of risks including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients our partners may also be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships if these circumstances occur we may be required to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages provide additional services or make additional investments to ensure adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services under agreements with joint and several liabilities we could be liable for both our obligations and those of our partners these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner in these cases we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture in addition these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts 

much of the work performed under our contracts is performed by thirdparty subcontractors we hire we also rely on thirdparty equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired if we are not able to locate qualified thirdparty subcontractors or the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated especially in a lumpsum or a fixedprice contract we may suffer losses on these contracts if a subcontractor supplier or manufacturer fails to provide services supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason we may be required to source these services equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or on less favorable terms which could impact contract profitability 

in the current economic environment thirdparties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party’s ability to provide materials equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

maintaining adequate bonding capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win fixedprice contracts 

in line with industry practice we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds to our customers these bonds indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract if a bond is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond we cannot pursue that project 

historically we have had adequate bonding capacity but as is typically the case the issuance of a bond is at the surety’s sole discretion in addition because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms our inability to obtain adequate bonding and as a result to bid on new contracts that require such bonding could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we fail to comply with federal state local or foreign governmental requirements our business may be adversely affected 

we are subject to us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business for example we are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost violations of these regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities 

various us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants the liability under these laws is joint and several we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various 

  

page 21 

properties the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen cleanup obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

when we perform our services our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions we may be subject to liability claims by employees customers and third parties as a result of such exposures in addition we may be subject to fines penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws a claim if not covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

such laws regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could for example relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and in turn could negatively impact our revenue our failure to comply with such laws or regulations whether actual or alleged could expose us to fines penalties or potential litigation liabilities including costs settlements and judgments any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments which may require us or our clients to obtain and to comply with federal state and local government permits and approvals any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial revocation or modification under various circumstances failure to obtain or comply with or the loss or modification of the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and result of operations 

our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders although we have policies and procedures to comply with us and foreign international trade laws the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and could damage our reputation and therefore our ability to do business 

employee agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts which could result in reduced revenues and profits 

misconduct fraud noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or other improper activities by one of our employees agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations regulations regarding the protection of classified information regulations prohibiting bribery and other corrupt practices regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts regulations on lobbying or similar activities regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting environmental laws and any other applicable laws or regulations for example we routinely provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters if a security breach were to occur our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective and we could face unknown risks or losses our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act of 2010 and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices despite our training and compliance programs there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the loss of or a significant reduction in business from one or a few customers could have an adverse impact on us 

a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue andor backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years for example in fiscal 2011 2010 and fiscal 2009 approximately 244 254 and 203 respectively of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government although we have longstanding relationships with many of our significant clients our clients may unilaterally reduce delay or cancel their 

  

page 22 

contracts at any time our loss of or a significant reduction in business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we engage in a highly competitive business if we are unable to compete effectively we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

we face intense competition to provide technical professional and construction services to clients the extent of such competition varies by industry geographic market and project type for example with respect to our construction and operations and maintenance services clients generally award large projects to large contractors which may give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects conversely with respect to our engineering design architectural and consulting services low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller newer competitors if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both which if significant could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our larger competitors for engineering construction and maintenance services for process plants include bechtel fluor foster wheeler kbr technip worleyparsons the shaw group and amec in the area of buildings our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr hok aecom and turner in the area of infrastructure our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as urs parsons brinckerhoff hntb tetra tech parsons and ws atkins in the area of national government programs our principal competitors include several of the competitors listed above as well as saic ch2m hill weston lockheed martin and computer sciences corporation 

in addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in risk factors our international operations are also exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies 

for fiscal 2011 approximately 38 of our revenues was earned from clients outside the us our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues at a minimum our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects both positive and negative that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar into the us dollar in addition our international operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic political and other conditions our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

page 23 

our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties 

our business strategy involves growth through among other things the acquisition of other companies acquiring companies presents a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us the current credit markets may make it more difficult and costly to finance acquisitions acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 

in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make we could dilute share ownership 

one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities accordingly we filed a shelf registration statement on form s4 on december 7 2007 if we issue additional equity securities pursuant to this shelf registration statement or otherwise such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders’ individual ownership percentages in the company 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock because of a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

page 24 

our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements 

in preparing our financial statements our management is required under us gaap to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities areas requiring significant estimates by our management include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

an impairment charge of goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

under us gaap we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach as of september 30 2011 we had 17 billion of goodwill representing 289 of our total assets of 60 billion we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business potential government actions toward our facilities and other factors 

if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value we could be required to record an impairment charge the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing please see item 7— management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 

rising inflation interest rates andor construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts in particular with respect to our fixedprice contracts 

rising inflation interest rates or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services in addition we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixedprice and may be at risk to the effects of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are guaranteed maximumprice because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from costreimbursable type contracts approximately 81 during fiscal 2011 the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor however if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixedprice and lumpsum work is more prevalent inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future therefore increases in inflation interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may be affected by market or regulatory responses to climate change 

growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations for example there is a growing consensus that new and additional regulations may be enacted concerning among other things greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased compliance costs for us and our clients legislation international protocols regulation or other restrictions on emissions could also affect our clients including those who are involved in the exploration production or refining of fossil fuels such changes could increase the costs of projects for our clients or in some cases prevent a project from going forward thereby potentially reducing the need for our services which would in turn have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations however these changes could also increase the pace projects such as carbon capture or storage 

  

page 25 

projects that could have a positive impact on our business we cannot predict when or whether any of these various proposals may be enacted or what their effect will be on us or on our customers 

our effective tax rate may increase or decrease 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the ordinary course of our business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation the introduction of new tax accounting standards legislation regulations and related interpretations our global mix of earnings the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

systems and information technology interruption could adversely impact our ability to operate 

we rely heavily on computer information and communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business from time to time we experience occasional system interruptions and delays in the event we are unable to regularly deploy software and hardware effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems the operation of such systems could be interrupted or result in the loss corruption or release of data in addition our computer and communication systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters telecommunications failures acts of war or terrorism computer viruses physical or electronic security breaches or similar events or disruptions any of these or other events could cause interruptions delays loss of critical andor sensitive data or similar effects which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition protection of intellectual property and results of operations as well as those of our clients 

we are subject to professional standards duties and statutory obligations on professional reports and opinions we issue which could subject us to monetary damages 

we issue reports and opinions to clients based on our professional engineering expertise as well as our other professional credentials that subject us to professional standards duties and obligations regulating the performance of our services for example we issue opinions and reports to government clients in connection with securities offerings if a client or another third party alleges that our report or opinion is incorrect or it is improperly relied upon and we are held responsible we could be subject to significant monetary damages 

delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control 

we are a delaware corporation certain antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us in addition certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover for example 

 

  

  

  

 these types of provisions as well as our ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement in the future could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders accordingly stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend critical accounting policies 

in order to understand better the changes that occur to key elements of our financial condition results of operations and cash flows a reader of this management’s discussion and analysis “mda” should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business performing longterm engineering and constructiontype contracts requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect both the entity’s results of operations and the carrying values of its assets and liabilities although our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 – significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k the following discussion is intended to highlight and describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue accounting for contracts and use of joint ventures —in general we recognize revenues at the time we provide services depending on the commercial terms of the contract we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred or using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion this method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress in making such estimates judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule the costs of materials and labor productivity and the impact of change orders liability claims contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee for contracts containing incentive fee arrangements fees are frequently based on achievement of target completion dates target costs andor other performance criteria failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or nonrecoverable costs which could exceed revenues recognized from the project 

we provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known without regard to the percentage of completion for multiple contracts with a single customer we account for each contract separately 

the nature of our business sometimes results in clients subcontractors or vendors presenting claims to us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible in those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract we include in the total estimated costs of the contract and therefore the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract an estimate based on all relevant facts and circumstances available of the additional costs to be incurred similarly and in the normal course of business we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible in those situations where we have presented such claims to our clients we include in revenues the amount of costs incurred without profit to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims 

certain costreimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment in this situation revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts in those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs that are not allowable under the terms of the contract we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly 

as is common to the industry we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures and consortiums although the joint ventures own and hold the contracts with the clients the services required by the contracts are typically performed by us and our joint venture partners or by other subcontractors under subcontracting agreements with the joint ventures the assets of our joint ventures therefore consist almost entirely of cash and receivables representing amounts due from clients and the liabilities of our joint ventures consist almost entirely of amounts due to the joint venture partners for services provided by the partners to the joint ventures under their individual subcontracts and other subcontractors in general at any given time the equity of our joint ventures represents the undistributed profits earned on contracts the joint ventures hold with clients very few of our joint ventures have employees none of our joint ventures have thirdparty debt or credit facilities our joint ventures therefore are simply mechanisms used to deliver engineering and construction services to clients rarely do they in and of themselves present any risk of loss to us or to our partners separate from those that we would carry if we were performing the contract on our own under us gaap our share of losses associated with the contracts held by the joint ventures if and when they occur has always been reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

  

page 31 

on october 2 2010 the company adopted the financial accounting standards board’s “fasb” new accounting guidance relating to the consolidation of variable interest entities “vie” this guidance replaces the quantitativebased assessment for determining which participant in a vie has a controlling interest in the vie with an approach that is now primarily qualitative the company has reassessed its vies using the new guidance the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

in evaluating our vies we perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether or not we have a controlling financial interest in the vie we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a vie if we have i the power to direct those activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and ii the right to receive benefits or obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie in making our qualitative analysis we assess each vie to determine those activities that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and whether we another party or multiple parties have the power to direct such activities 

if we determine that we have the power to direct those activities of the vie that most significantly impact its financial performance and have the right or obligation to receive benefits or absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the vie then we are the primary beneficiary of the vie and we consolidate the vie if we determine that we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the vie or power is shared by two or more unrelated parties then we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not consolidate the vie for the company’s unconsolidated joint ventures we use either the equity method of accounting or proportional consolidation the company does not currently participate in any significant vies in which it has a controlling financial interest that it does not consolidate 

accounting for stock issued to employees and others — we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the estimated grantdate fair value of the award we estimate the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors using the blackscholes optionpricing model like all optionpricing models the blackscholes models require the use of highly subjective assumptions including i the expected volatility of the market price of the underlying stock and ii the expected term of the award among others accordingly changes in assumptions and any subsequent adjustments to those assumptions can cause drastically different fair values to be assigned to our stock option awards for restricted stock units containing service and performance conditions compensation expense is based on the fair value of such units using a monte carlo simulation due to the uncertainties inherent in the use of assumptions and the results of applying monte carlo simulations the amount of expense recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the effects on our future consolidated financial statements because equity awards tend to vest over several years and additional equity awards may be made in the future 

accounting for pension plans — the accounting for pension plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans’ assets and liabilities these assumptions include discount rates investment returns and projected salary increases among others the actuarial assumptions used in determining the funded statuses of the plans are provided in note 7 – pension plans of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

the expected rates of return on plan assets for fiscal 2012 range from 27 to 75 this compares to a range of 22 to 80 for fiscal 2011 we believe the range of rates we applied for fiscal 2012 reflects the longterm returns expected on the plans’ assets considering recent market conditions projected rates of inflation the diversification of the plans’ assets and the expected real rates of market returns the discount rates used to compute plan liabilities were changed from a range of 21 to 51 in fiscal 2010 to a range of 26 to 59 in fiscal 2011 these assumptions represent the company’s best estimate of the rates at which its pension obligations could be effectively settled 

changes in the actuarial assumptions often have a material affect on the values assigned to plan assets and liabilities and the associated pension expense for example if the discount rate used to value the net pension benefit obligation “pbo” at september 30 2011 was higher lower by 05 the pbo would have been lower higher at that date by approximately 790 million for nonus plans and by approximately 283 million for us plans if the expected return on plan assets was higher lower by 10 the net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2012 would be lower higher by approximately 76 million for nonus plans and by approximately 24 million for us plans differences between actuarial assumptions and actual performance ie actuarial gains and losses that are not recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost in the period in which such differences arise are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are recognized as part of net periodic pension cost in future periods in accordance with us gaap management monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in an effort to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used 

  

page 32 

contractual guarantees litigation investigations and insurance — in the normal course of business we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation the guarantees to which we are a party generally relate to project schedules and plant performance most of the litigation in which we are involved has us as a defendant in workers’ compensation personal injury environmental employmentlabor professional liability and other similar lawsuits we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations we have elected however to retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under our insurance programs this situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured and we intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of our contracts 

in accordance with us gaap we record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such guarantees litigation and insurance claims we include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations 

in addition as a contractor providing services to the united states federal government and several of its agencies we are subject to many levels of audits investigations and claims by or on behalf of the us federal government with respect to contract performance pricing costs cost allocations and procurement practices we adjust revenues based upon the amounts we expect to realize considering the effects of any client audits or governmental investigations 

testing goodwill for possible impairment — the goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets is tested annually for possible impairment in performing the annual impairment test we evaluate our goodwill at the reporting unit level we have determined that we have two reporting units which are based on geography we refer to these reporting units internally as “europe” and “noneurope” each of our reporting units conducts the business activities described elsewhere in this 2011 form 10k which includes providing professional technical services such as design engineering and architectural services construction andor construction management services and maintenance and operations services 

our geographybased reporting units reflect the company’s organizational structure which is based predominately on geography as well as our acquisition strategy which favors acquisition targets that among other things provide access to new geographic areas our reporting units represent rational groupings into which substantially all of our major acquisitions which are responsible for the goodwill appearing in our consolidated balance sheet have been assimilated and where all of the operations under each reporting unit share in the benefits of the goodwill created by our acquisitions 

us gaap does not prescribe a specific valuation method for estimating the fair value of reporting units we determined that a market approach is an appropriate method for valuing our reporting units in light of its common use as a technique for valuing businesses in general using this method the fair value of our reporting units was estimated by multiplying their respective aftertax earnings for the trailing twelve months by the company’s overall average market earnings multiple since the activities of each reporting unit approximates that of the company overall we concluded that the use the company’s market multiple for purposes of applying the marketbased valuation approach was reasonable we also consider the market multiples of similar businesses we believe that the use of this multiple is appropriate considering that both reporting units have qualitative characteristics that are generally consistent with those of the parent company those characteristics include size in terms of resources ie personnel a large diverse client base broad geographic reach and a broad range of design engineering and construction and construction management capabilities 

the determination of reporting units and the selection of the valuation technique used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units requires the exercise of judgment by management the fair values resulting from the valuation technique used are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of the reporting units to willing third parties 

as mentioned above the key inputs used in the valuation model are the aftertax earnings of our reporting units and the company’s marketdriven average earnings multiple the multiples used for fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 were approximately 18 14 and 15 respectively in the event either the aftertax earnings of the company’s reporting units or the company’s market earnings multiples decline significantly after the date the annual impairment test is performed the company will reperform the test at a date closer to fiscal yearend we have determined that the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 

based on the most recent results of our annual impairment tests there were no indications of impairment of the goodwill shown in our consolidated balance sheets at either september 30 2011 or october 1 2010 

changes in the inputs used in our valuation model ie declines in the company’s average earnings multiple or the aftertax earnings of our reporting units could result in an indication of possible impairment of goodwill in the future

fiscal 2011 — overview 

the most significant event that affects the comparability of the company’s consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2010 is the loss that was recorded last year in connection with the sivom judgment 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2010 we received an unfavorable court judgment relating to a waste incineration project in france for the sivom de mulhousienne the “sivom judgment” the sivom project was performed by a consortium of contractors that was led by one of our subsidiaries under a contract that was entered into in 1996 prior to our acquisition of that subsidiary as a result of the judgment we recorded a pretax charge to earnings of approximately 933 million net of the effects of the charge on the company’s longterm incentive bonus plan and income taxes the effect on net earnings attributable to jacobs for the fiscal year ended october 1 2010 was approximately 603 million or 048 per diluted share 

because of the unusual nature of the sivom judgment we include in certain places within this mda a discussion of the company’s consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2011 as it compares to fiscal 2010 both with and without the effects of the sivom judgment although any fiscal 2010 information that excludes the effects of the sivom judgment is nonus gaap it is presented because management believes such information provides a better point of reference for assessing the company’s current financial performance and operating trends 

the following table reconciles the company’s fiscal 2010 consolidated results of operations presented in accordance with us gaap to its fiscal 2010 consolidated results of operations excluding the effects of the sivom judgment in thousands except earnings per share 

 

 the company’s net earnings increased 851 million or 346 from 2460 million for fiscal 2010 to 3310 million for fiscal 2011 excluding the effects of the sivom judgment the company’s net earnings increased 248 million or 81 from 3063 million for fiscal 2010 to 3310 million for fiscal 2011 contributing to this increase in net earnings was an increase in revenues on projects for customers operating in a number of industry groups and markets including mining and minerals due primarily to the acquisition of the aker entities which is discussed in more detail in note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements infrastructure chemicals and polymers and oil  gas – upstream also contributing to the increase in net earnings was good control over our selling general and administrative “sga” expenses although sga expenses increased 1081 million or 116 from 9325 million in fiscal 2010 to 104 billion in fiscal 2011 the aker entities contributed approximately 1130 million of this increase 

with respect to the company’s consolidated financial condition bank indebtedness increased 4882 million during fiscal 2011 from 799 million at october 1 2010 to 5681 million at september 30 2011 substantially all of the increase relates to debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of the aker entities 

backlog at september 30 2011 increased 11 billion or 82 to 143 billion included in this amount is approximately 10 billion related to the aker entities backlog at september 30 2011 includes new awards from clients operating in the oil  gasupstream high technology and infrastructure industries and markets

results of operations 

general 

our business focuses exclusively on providing technical professional and construction services to a large number of industrial commercial and governmental clients around the world the services we provide generally fall into four broad categories 

 

  

  

  

 the scope of services we can provide our clients therefore ranges from consulting and conceptual design services which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project to complete singleresponsibility designbuild contracts to services required in the post startup phases of a project such as maintenance and operations services 

the following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each of the last three fiscal years in thousands 

 

 we focus our services on clients operating in select industry groups and markets we believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit crossutilization of our resources the following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each of the last three fiscal years in thousands 

 

 we recorded net earnings of 3310 million or 260 per diluted share for the fiscal year ended september 30 2011 compared to 2460 million or 196 per diluted share for the fiscal year ended october 1 2010 excluding the effects of the sivom judgment net earnings and earnings per share for fiscal 2010 were 3063 million and 244 respectively 

revenues increased 4661 million or 47 from 99 billion for fiscal 2010 to 104 billion for fiscal 2011 revenues from clients operating in the mining and minerals markets increased significantly during fiscal 2011 due primarily to the acquisition of the aker entities revenues from clients for infrastructure projects increased 2807 million or 299 from 9390 million for fiscal 2010 to 12 billion for fiscal 2011 contributing to this increase were higher project services revenues for various transportation projects in the us combined with revenues attributable to the aker entities revenues from clients operating in the chemicals  polymers markets increased 2578 million or 214 from 12 billion for fiscal 2010 to 15 billion for fiscal 2011 revenues from clients

operating in the oil  gas – upstream markets increased 1940 million or 347 from 5595 million for fiscal 2010 to 7535 million for fiscal 2011 contributing to this increase were several large epc projects performed in north america 

direct costs of contracts increased 2393 million or 28 from 86 billion during fiscal 2010 to 88 billion during fiscal 2011 direct costs of contracts include all costs incurred in connection with and directly for the benefit of client contracts including depreciation and amortization relating to assets used in connection with providing the services required by client projects the level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors including the amount of passthrough costs we incur during a period on those projects where we are responsible for subcontract labor or thirdparty materials and equipment we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs and we refer to such costs as “passthrough costs” on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not considered passthrough costs and are therefore not reflected in either revenues or costs to the extent that we incur a significant amount of passthrough costs in a period our direct cost of contracts are likely to increase as well 

passthrough costs decreased 6048 million or 222 from 27 billion during fiscal 2010 to 21 billion for fiscal 2011 in general passthrough costs are more significant on projects that have a higher content of field services activities field services revenues decreased 3067 million or 64 from 48 billion during fiscal 2010 to 45 billion during fiscal 2011 passthrough costs are generally incurred at a specific point in the lifecycle of a project and are highly dependent on the needs of our individual clients and the nature of the clients’ projects however because we have hundreds of projects which start at various times within a fiscal year the effect of passthrough costs on the level of direct costs of contracts can vary between fiscal years without there being a fundamental or significant change to the underlying business 

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts were 850 for fiscal 2011 compared to 866 for fiscal 2010 the relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided generally speaking the more procurement we do on behalf of our clients ie where we purchase equipment and materials for use on projects andor procure subcontracts in connection with projects and the more field services revenues we have relative to technical professional services revenues the higher the ratio will be of direct costs of contracts to revenues because revenues from passthrough costs typically have lower margin rates associated with them it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in such revenues without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit the decrease in the ratio of direct costs of contracts to revenues in fiscal 2011 as compared to last year was due primarily to lower levels of passthrough costs 

sga expenses for fiscal 2011 increased by 1081 million or 116 to 104 billion compared to 9325 million for fiscal 2010 the aker entities contributed 1130 million inclusive of due diligence and integration costs of sga expenses for the fiscal year ended september 30 2011 excluding the sga expenses of the aker entities sga expenses for fiscal 2011 decreased by 49 million compared to fiscal 2010 our sga expenses typically fluctuate as a result of changes in homeoffice headcount and the amount of spending required to support our technical professional services activities which normally require additional overhead costs therefore when our technical professional services revenues increase or decrease it is not unusual to see a corresponding change in sga expenses the decrease in sga expenses during fiscal 2011 was due primarily to management’s efforts to reduce sga expenses 

operating profit was 5189 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2011 compared to 4001 million 4783 million before the effects of the sivom judgment for the fiscal year ended october 1 2010 as a percentage of revenues operating profit was 50 for fiscal 2011 compared to 40 in fiscal 2010 48 before the effects of the sivom judgment 

even though the company maintained significant cash balances during fiscal 2011 the rate of interest earned on our deposits and investments remained low in fiscal 2011 

interest expense for fiscal 2011 decreased 11 million as compared to fiscal 2010 excluding the effects of the sivom judgment interest expense for fiscal 2011 increased 88 million as compared to fiscal 2010 the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2011 was due primarily to the debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of the aker entities interest expense in fiscal 2010 included the reversal of 29 million of interest expense that was accrued over a number of years in connection with an income tax matter that was resolved successfully 

the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate was 351 for fiscal 2011 compared to 372 in fiscal 2010 the tax rate in fiscal 2011 decreased from fiscal 2010 due to a change in the mix of international work and the successful resolution of a us domestic tax issue in the normal course of our business we may engage in numerous transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in income or deducted as an expense is uncertain additionally we file income franchise gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service most states in the united states and by various government agencies 

  

page 36 

representing many jurisdictions outside the united states we continually monitor the appropriateness of the rate and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will change 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

we recorded net earnings of 2460 million or 196 per diluted share 3063 million or 244 per diluted share before the effects of the sivom judgment for the fiscal year ended october 1 2010 compared to net earnings of 3999 million or 321 per diluted share for fiscal 2009 

revenues for the fiscal year ended october 1 2010 totaled 99 billion and represents a decrease of 16 billion or 135 as compared to 115 billion for fiscal 2009 

revenues during fiscal 2010 from projects for clients operating in many of the industry groups and markets we serve were significantly lower as compared to fiscal 2009 the larger decreases occurred in the refining – downstream oil  gas – upstream and the pharmaceuticals and biotechnology industry groups and markets these declines related to the normal windingdown and completion of large projects combined with the lack of new project awards these industry groups and markets was also significantly impacted by the global recession causing many clients to reexamine their capital expenditure plans resulting in the delay in the release of new projects and in certain instances cancellations of projects awarded to us previously also contributing to the decline in revenues within these industry groups and markets was a 13 billion or 322 decrease in passthrough costs 

in contrast revenues during fiscal 2010 from projects for national government program clients increased by 1659 million or 77 as compared to fiscal 2009 most of the increase related to revenues from the us federal government on projects for research and development test engineering scientific other technical services projects 

similarly revenues during fiscal 2010 related to buildings projects increased by 762 million or 96 as compared to fiscal 2009 the increase relates to spending for the design of technical buildings 

for the fiscal year 2010 we earned 1768 million in revenues for projects funded by the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 

direct costs of contracts for fiscal 2010 decreased 13 billion or 134 to 86 billion compared to 99 billion for fiscal 2009 passthrough costs for fiscal 2010 decreased 13 billion or 322 to 27 billion compared to 40 billion for fiscal 2009 field services revenues for fiscal 2010 decreased 11 billion or 190 to 48 billion compared to 59 billion for fiscal 2009 

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts were 866 for fiscal 2010 compared to 864 for fiscal 2009 the decrease in the ratio of direct costs of contracts to revenues in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was due primarily to lower levels of passthrough costs 

sga expenses for fiscal 2010 decreased by 78 million or 08 to 9325 million compared to 9403 million for fiscal 2009 the decrease in sga expenses during fiscal 2010 was due primarily to management’s efforts to reduce sga expenses 

operating profit for fiscal 2010 decreased by 2205 million or 355 to 4001 million 1423 million or 229 to 4783 million before the effects of the sivom judgment compared to 6206 million for fiscal 2009 as a percentage of revenues operating profit was 40 49 before the effects of the sivom judgment for fiscal 2010 compared to 54 in fiscal 2009 in addition to the effects of the sivom judgment the decrease in operating profit was due primarily to the overall decline in business volume 

interest income for fiscal 2010 decreased by 84 million to 48 million compared to 131 million for fiscal 2009 even though the company maintained significant cash balances during fiscal 2010 the rate of interest earned on our deposits and investments was significantly lower in 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 

interest expense for fiscal 2010 increased 70 million as compared to fiscal 2009 excluding the effects of the sivom judgment interest expense for fiscal 2010 decreased 29 million as compared to fiscal 2009 this decrease in interest expense was due primarily to the reversal of 29 million of interest expense that was accrued over the past several years in connection with an income tax matter that was resolved successfully in fiscal 2010 

the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate was 372 for fiscal 2010 compared to 360 in fiscal 2009 the increase in the tax rate in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 was primarily related to not receiving a tax benefit on the 259 million noncash charge related to the sivom judgment

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth certain information about our contractual obligations as of september 30 2011 in thousands 

 

  

    backlog 

backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us with respect to om contracts however we include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for only one succeeding year regardless of the remaining life of the contract for national government programs other than us federal om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding option periods 

the following table summarizes our backlog for each of the last three fiscal years in millions 

 

 the entire value of contract awards are added to backlog when the contracts are awarded to us accordingly backlog can fluctuate from one reporting period to the next due to the timing of when new contracts are added to backlog and when the contract revenue is recognized in our consolidated financial statements many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years our backlog at september 30 2011 increased by 11 billion or 82 to 143 billion from 132 billion at october 1 2010 

in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client in a situation where a client terminates a contract we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and in certain instances we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs there were no significant project cancellations in fiscal 2011 

while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein accordingly backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenues 

  

page 38 

backlog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies totaled approximately 36 billion or 249 of total backlog 43 billion or 326 of total backlog and 42 billion or 277 of total backlog at september 30 2011 october 1 2010 and october 2 2009 respectively most of our federal contracts require that services be provided beyond one year in general these contracts must be funded annually ie the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the us congress to the procuring agency and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts 

subject to the factors discussed in item 1a— risk factors  above we estimate that approximately 77 billion or 542 of total backlog at september 30 2011 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year 

effects of inflation 

the effects of inflation on our business is discussed in item 1a— risk factors  and is incorporated herein by reference 

liquidity and capital resources 

at september 30 2011 our primary sources of liquidity consisted of 9056 million of cash and cash equivalents and 895 million of available borrowing capacity under our 2900 million unsecured revolving credit facility we finance as much of our operations and growth as possible through cash generated by our operations 

in addition to our revolving credit facility we entered into several new bilateral credit facilities with major us and european banks in connection with the acquisition of the aker entities approximately 2928 million was outstanding under these facilities at september 30 2011 in connection with our purchase of an additional 55 interest in ces we entered into two bilateral facilities with major banks in the us and asia approximately 667 million was outstanding under these facilities at september 30 2011 and in connection with our fiscal 2009 acquisition of a onethird interest in awe management ltd we entered into a shortterm credit facility with a major uk bank of which 326 million was outstanding at september 30 2011 

during fiscal 2011 our cash and cash equivalents decreased by 332 million to 9056 million at september 30 2011 this compares to a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 948 million to 9388 million during the corresponding period last year during fiscal 2011 we used 8018 million of cash and cash equivalents for investing activities this cash outflow was offset in part by net cash inflows of 2365 million from operating activities and 5569 million from financing activities 

our operations provided net cash of 2365 million during fiscal 2011 this compares to net cash inflows of 2211 million and 5317 million during fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively the 154 million increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was due primarily to an 889 million increase in net earnings and a 153 million increase in deferred income tax expense offset in part by 284 million of changes relating to other deferred liabilities the effects on cash flows from changes in other deferred liabilities were included in cash flows from financing activities in fiscal 2010 and 2009 a 225 million decrease relating to changes in our working capital accounts discussed below and the effect of the 259 million noncash charge relating to the fiscal 2010 sivom judgment 

because such a high percentage of our revenues are earned on costplus type contracts and due to the significance of revenues relating to passthrough costs most of the costs we incur are included in invoices we send to clients although we continually monitor our accounts receivable we manage the operating cash flows of the company by managing the working capital accounts in total rather than by the individual elements the primary elements of the company’s working capital accounts are accounts receivable accounts payable and billings in excess of cost accounts payable consists of obligations to third parties relating primarily to costs incurred for projects which are generally billable to clients accounts receivable consist of billings to our clients — a substantial portion of which is for projectrelated costs billings in excess of cost consist of billings to and payments from our clients for costs yet to be incurred 

this relationship between revenues and costs and between receivables and payables is unique for our industry and facilitates review of our liquidity at the total working capital level there was little change in our total working capital accounts during fiscal 2011 when compared to fiscal 2010 however there were significant changes within the components of our working capital accounts these changes were due primarily to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts combined with an increase in our receivables relative to the increase in our overall business activity during fiscal 2011 we experienced an increase in the age of our receivables this situation was due primarily to a change in our customer and business mix combined with certain customers implementing internal system and process changes which has contributed to delays in processing our receivables we believe this situation does not present a significant risk to the company’s cash flows 

  

page 39 

we used 8018 million of cash and cash equivalents for investing activities during fiscal 2011 this compares to 3985 million and 931 million during fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively the 4034 million increase in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was due to increased business acquisition activity during fiscal 2011 we acquired techteam sula dswa a controlling interest in ces the aker entities and two other smaller niche engineering and design firms 

additions to property and equipment used 987 million of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2011 as compared to 491 million used during the fiscal 2010 included in fiscal 2011 additions to property and equipment is 491 million related to the purchase of an office building we use in our operations and the associated equipment and furniture 

our financing activities resulted in net cash inflows of 5569 million during fiscal 2011 this compares to net cash inflows of 956 million during fiscal 2010 and net cash outflows of 390 million during fiscal 2009 the 4613 million net increase in cash flows from financing activities during fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 was due primarily to a net 4463 million increase in the company’s overall short and longterm borrowing activities also contributing to the increase in cash flows from financing activities in fiscal 2011 as compared to the previous year is the change in classification of other deferred liabilities prior to fiscal 2011 the company treated the effects on cash flows from changes in its other deferred liabilities as effects from financing activities during fiscal 2011 the company concluded that treating such changes as relating to operating activities was preferable the company also concluded that this change in presentation was not quantitatively or qualitatively material 

we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations support our acquisition strategy and service our debt for the next twelve months although borrowings under our 2900 million unsecured revolving credit facility classified previously as longterm debt became current during the third quarter of fiscal 2011 the facility expires in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we nevertheless had 9056 million in cash and cash equivalents at september 30 2011 compared to 9388 million at october 1 2010 in addition we are actively negotiating a renewal of our credit facilities with several banks and other institutions and we believe we will successfully complete the negotiations early in fiscal 2012 our consolidated working capital position at september 30 2011 was 11 billion a decrease of 4283 million from october 1 2010 additionally there was 895 million of borrowing capacity available at september 30 2011 under our 2900 million revolving credit facility we believe that the remaining capacity terms and conditions of our revolving credit facility combined with cash onhand and the other committed and uncommitted facilities we have in place are adequate for our working capital and general business requirements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are party to financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk in the form of guarantees not reflected in our balance sheet that arise in the normal course of business however such offbalance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or resources that is material to investors see note 10 – commitments and contingencies and derivative financial instruments of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk in the normal course of business our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

our primary source for credit is a 2900 million unsecured revolving credit facility the total amount utilized under this facility at september 30 2011 was 2005 million 1718 million in the form of direct borrowings and 287 million utilized in the form of letters of credit this agreement expires in may 2012 and provides for both fixedrate and variablerate borrowings our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we continuously monitor changes in interest rates and use cash provided from operations to repay our borrowings as quickly as possible furthermore the company can generally use a combination of both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk 

foreign currency risk 

in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency we attempt to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs in those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies we follow the provisions of asc 81510 in accounting for our derivative contracts the company does not currently have exchange rate sensitive instruments that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

the company’s management with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined by rule 13a15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of september 30 2011 the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k the “evaluation date” based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the evaluation date 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act management with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the evaluation date based on the framework established in “ internal control—integrated framework”  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

management excluded from the scope of its assessment the acquired operations of the aker entities which are included in the company’s consolidated financial statements the majority of the operations comprising the aker entities was acquired in february 2011 and the balance of the aker entities was acquired in may 2011 the aker entities comprised 112 and 118 of the company’s consolidated total assets and net assets respectively as of september 30 2011 the aker entities contributed 66 and 86 of the company’s total consolidated revenues and net earnings respectively for the year ended september 30 2011 

based on management’s assessment and subject only to the qualification described in the preceding paragraph management has concluded that the company’s internal controls over financial reporting as of the evaluation date were effective the company’s independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting which appears later in this annual report on form 10k 

changes in internal control 

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the company’s fiscal quarter ended september 30 2011 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

limitations on effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its system of internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed or operated can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of internal control are met the design of the company’s control system reflects the fact that there are resource constraints and that the benefits of such control system must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control failures and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the intentional acts of individuals by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that the design of any particular control will always succeed in achieving its objective under all potential future conditions

business strategy 

general 

there are four major components of our business strategy 

 

  

  

  

 acquisitions play an important role in our business strategy as they allow us to expand on existing client relationships as well as develop new ones acquisitions also allow us the opportunity to leverage our cost structure across geographic areas 

safety and beyondzero ® 

most companies in our industry try to provide their employees with a safe and secure work environment they create safety programs insist on employee training and make every effort to build awareness we do this too but within the company we see safety differently 

in 2007 we introduced a concept we call beyondzero ®  a companywide initiative designed to educate and train our employees and to instill in them a culture of caring that follows them outside of the workplace or jobsite beyondzero ® has inspired our organization to a deeper richer emotional commitment to the safety of our employees their families their clients partners and friends and beyond 

providing an injury and incidentfree work environment is an unequivocal condition of the relationship we have with our employees and subcontractors it is also a paramount issue in our dealings with our clients and our safety program and beyondzero ® are fundamental elements of our overall approach to risk management a safe work environment is critical to our longterm success and growth we maintain a centralized quality and safety group to help ensure that the services we provide are delivered safely and in accordance with standard work processes unsafe job sites and office environments increase employee turnover increase the cost of projects to our clients expose us to types and levels of risk that are fundamentally unacceptable and increase our own operating costs as well 

we believe that we have a responsibility to go beyond these issues we have developed a culture of caring where concern for our employees’ health and safety extends past office walls beyond field sites and past the perception that injured employees simply cost the company time and money it’s about safekeeping 

safe job sites and office environments benefit our clients promote employee morale and enhance the longterm relationships we have with our clients employees and business partners 

  

relationshipbased business model 

our relationshipbased business model is central to our sustained growth and profitability we aggressively pursue the development of longterm affiliations and alliances with our clients by working as a partner with our clients on their capital programs we increase our understanding of their overall business needs as well as the unique technical requirements of their projects this increased understanding gives us the opportunity to provide superior value to our clients we market all of our services to clients in connection with their projects where the scope of work required is within our expertise by integrating and bundling our services ie providing design engineering and construction services on the same project we can price contracts more competitively and enhance overall profitability while delivering additional value to our clients our relationshipbased business model also helps us more fully understand the risks inherent in our projects which in turn allows us to better manage those risks our approach also provides us with opportunities to market those services our clients will need in the post startup and commissioning phases of a plant such as operations and maintenance services this model however does not preclude us from undertaking discrete projects we will accept and perform discrete projects for our clients if we can negotiate acceptable pricing and other contract terms and conditions 

closely linked to our relationshipbased business model is our multidomestic geographic strategy for conducting business around the world as part of this strategy we act and operate as a local contractor in geographic areas of the world in which we do business we believe it is important for us as a company to “be local” with respect to our network of offices and operations because our offices can generally sustain themselves with a base load of local work we’re able to support our multinational clients with their crossborder capital projects our core clients can depend on us for assistance with their engineering and construction needs when they move projects around the world our multidomestic strategy also allows us to be competitive around the world to the extent we are awarded large projects and are able to perform meaningful portions of the project utilizing local resources rather than exporting the work to other offices within the group 

cost control 

our continual emphasis on cost control is an important component of our business model as the global economy expands and companies providing technical professional and construction services are required to compete against each other across geographic boundaries the company that can provide its clients with cost efficient solutions to their project needs has the advantage our attention to cost control throughout every level of our organization allows us to deliver superior technical professional and construction services safely efficiently and within the cost and time parameters our clients require 

organizational structure 

our organizational structure and integrated system for delivering services is another key component of our business strategy our operating units generally use a matrix organizational structure whereby our project management functions are supported by the various technical engineering design and construction disciplines that are necessary to effectively execute longterm engineering and construction contracts crucial functions such as project controls and procurement are embedded within each of our major offices and serve operations by providing specialized services required by projects in addition we actively employ a boundaryless approach to the way we serve our clients we do not maintain “profit centers” within the company nor do our operating groups compete against each other for contracts instead our organizational structure encourages our operating groups to work cohesively while simultaneously helping to reduce costs and promote an efficient delivery system for all of our services 

the role of acquisitions in our business strategy 

our relationshipbased business model is a significant driver of our acquisition strategy when we review potential acquisition targets we are conscious of the effect the acquisition may have on our client base we favor acquisitions that allow us to expand or enhance the range of services we provide existing clients andor gain access to new geographic areas in which our clients either already operate or plan to expand by expanding into 

  

new geographic areas and adding to our existing technical and project management capabilities we strive to position ourselves as a preferred singlesource provider of technical professional and construction services to our major clients the following is a brief description of some of our recent key acquisitions 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in any particular year we will also make smaller acquisitions as opportunities arise 

services provided 

as described above the services we provide generally fall into the following four broad categories project services process scientific and systems consulting services construction services and operations and maintenance services the scope of services we can provide our clients therefore range from consulting and conceptual design services which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project to complete singleresponsibility designbuildoperate contracts 

the following table sets forth our revenues from each of our four service categories for each of the last five fiscal years in thousands of dollars 

 

  

 project services 

we employ all of the engineering design architectural and related disciplines necessary to design and engineer modern process plants including projects for clients in the chemicals and polymers pharmaceuticals and biotechnology upstream oil  gas refining food and consumer products and basic resources industries buildings including facilities for clients in the health care education and criminal justice markets as well as other specialized buildings for clients in the private sector infrastructure projects including highways roads bridges and other transportation systems water and wastewater treatment plants water resources facilities and other similar plants and facilities technology and manufacturing facilities for clients in the aerospace automotive defense semiconductor and electronics industries consumer products manufacturing facilities power plants and stations pulp and paper plants and other facilities we also employ many of the requisite scientific technical and program management capabilities necessary to provide program integration testing and evaluation services for clients in the defense and aerospace industries for the dod in support of information systems for weapons acquisition centers for nasa for aerospace testing and propulsion systems and facilities and for various other agencies of the us federal government in support of environmental programs 

we are capable of providing our clients with a variety of value engineering services including “safety in design” through safety in design we integrate best practices hazard analysis and risk assessment methods early in the design phase of projects taking those steps necessary to eliminate or mitigate injury and damage during the construction startup testing and commissioning and operations phases of a project 

in the area of construction management we provide our clients with a wide range of services as an agent for our clients we may act as the program director whereby we oversee on the owner’s behalf the complete planning design and construction phases of the project alternatively our services may be limited to providing construction consulting 

  

also included in the category of project services are certain related services such as planning scheduling procurement estimating cost engineering project accounting and quality and safety necessary to support our engineering design construction construction and program management operations and maintenance and consulting services 

process scientific and systems consulting 

we employ all of the professional and technical skills and expertise with respect to a broad range of consulting services including performing pricing studies market analyses and financial projections necessary in determining the feasibility of a project performing gasoline reformulation modeling analyzing and evaluating layout and mechanical designs for complex processing plants analyzing automation and control systems analyzing designing and executing biocontainment strategies developing and performing process protocols with respect to the us food and drug administrationmandated qualification and validation requirements providing consultation on proposed railway and airport expansion projects and performing geological and metallurgical studies 

also included in this service category are the revenues relating to professional and program management services required to assist clients such as the us federal government and its agencies in a wide range of defense and aerospace related programs such services typically are more technical and scientific in nature than other project services we provide and may involve such tasks as supporting the development and testing of conventional weapons systems weapons modeling and simulations computer systems development maintenance and support evaluation and testing of missioncritical control systems and other highly technical programs and tasks 

construction 

we provide traditional field construction services to private and public sector clients in virtually all of the industry groups and markets to which we provide project services in the area of environmental remediation and restoration we provide environmental remedial construction services for a variety of public and private sector clients we also provide many of our clients with modular construction technology our modular construction technology is an advanced form of engineering and design offsite fabrication and assembly and field erection it provides our clients with an alternative approach to traditional methods of engineering and construction which can compress and shorten the construction schedule reduce risk and lower costs 

historically our field construction activities were focused primarily on those construction projects for which we perform much of the related engineering and design work by focusing our construction efforts on such projects we minimize the risks associated with constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared by third parties the financial risk to us of constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared by third parties may be particularly significant on fixedprice contracts therefore we generally avoid this type of project however we will pursue constructiononly projects when we can negotiate pricing and other contract terms we deem acceptable and which we believe will result in a fair return for the degree of risk we assume 

operations and maintenance “om” 

om generally refers to all of the tasks required to operate and maintain large complex facilities on behalf of clients we can provide key management and support services over all aspects of the operations of a facility including managing subcontractors and other onsite personnel within the environmental area om often includes engineering and technical support services as well as program management services necessary to remediate contaminated sites within the aerospace and defense areas om often requires us to provide the management and technical support services necessary to operate and maintain such sites as engine test facilities weapons integration facilities and hightech simulation and verification centers such om contracts also 

  

frequently require us to provide facilities management and maintenance services utilities operations and maintenance services property management and disposition services and construction support services 

om also includes process plant maintenance services which generally involves all of the tasks required to keep a process plant typically a refinery or chemical plant in daytoday operation such tasks could include the repair and replacement of pumps piping heat exchangers and other equipment as well as “turnaround” work which involves major refurbishment that can only be performed when the plant is shut down since shutdowns are expensive to the owners of the plant turnaround work often requires maximizing the number of skilled craft personnel who can work efficiently on a project on a 24hoursperday sevendaysperweek basis we use sophisticated computer scheduling and programming to complete turnaround projects quickly and we maintain contact with a large pool of skilled craft personnel we can hire as needed on maintenance and turnaround projects 

although the gross profit margins that we realize from om services are generally lower than those associated with the other services we provide the costs to support maintenance activities are also generally lower additionally although engineering and construction projects may be of a shortterm nature om services often result in longterm relationships with clients for example we have been providing maintenance services at several major process plants within the us for several decades this aspect of maintenance services greatly reduces the selling costs in respect of such services 

financial information about segments 

although we describe our business in this annual report on form 10k in terms of the services we provide the markets in which our clients operate and the geographic areas in which we operate we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the us in making this determination we considered various economic characteristics of our operations including the nature of the services we provide the nature of our internal processes for delivering and distributing those services and the types of customers we have in addition to the discussion that follows please refer to note 14— segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

there is a high degree of similarity of the workforces among our service categories for example engineering and design services ie services provided by persons who are degreed and in certain circumstances licensed professionals such as engineers architects scientists and economists exist in all four service categories in addition there is a high degree of similarity among a significant component of the workforces we employ to perform construction and om projects in providing construction and om services we employ a large number of skilled craft labor personnel these may include welders pipe fitters electricians crane operators and other personnel who work on very large capital projects in the case of projects classified within the construction services category or on smaller capital projects in the case of maintenance projects classified within the om services category 

our operating units use a matrix organizational structure our results therefore are dependent on groups representing technical disciplines eg electrical engineering mechanical engineering cost engineering etc supporting project management personnel who maintain the relationship between us and our clients and who are ultimately responsible for delivering projects to our clients safely on time and on budget additionally all of our operating regions and divisions use common tools policies and procedures to manage and run their respective units these include project review meetings project performance evaluations and project execution plans 

the use of technology throughout our organization is highly uniform whether it is computer aided design and drafting “cadd” applications used by our engineering and design staff or modeling programs used by the scientific and consulting staff or scheduling estimating and cost control applications used by homeoffice 

  

personnel in support of our construction and maintenance activities all of the service categories described above are equally affected by changes in technology as they occur in the economy at large 

furthermore the types of information and internal reports used by management to monitor performance evaluate results of operations allocate resources and otherwise manage the business support a single reportable segment accordingly based on these similarities we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment for purposes of the disclosures included in this annual report on form 10k

backlog 

backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us with respect to operations and maintenance “om” contracts however we include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for only one succeeding year regardless of the remaining life of the contract for national government programs other than us federal om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding option periods in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation termination or suspension at the discretion of the client in addition the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating 

  

to the contracts our backlog includes expected revenues for contracts that are based on estimates for information regarding our backlog refer to item 7— management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  below 

significant customers 

the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government for each of the last five fiscal years 

 

 it is uncommon for a commercial customer to contribute 10 or more of the company’s total revenues on occasion however we will perform a number of field services projects for a single customer in the same fiscal year which primarily because of the amount of passthrough costs discussed below that is included in revenue will cause total revenue from that customer to exceed 10 of total consolidated revenues for the fiscal year ended october 2 2009 revenues earned from motiva enterprises llc accounted for 122 of total consolidated revenues and for the fiscal year ended september 29 2006 revenues earned from valero energy corporation accounted for 102 of total consolidated revenues 

financial information about geographic areas 

selected financial information regarding the geographic areas in which we operate is included in note 14— segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k and is incorporated herein by reference 

contracts 

while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake our contracts generally fall into three broad categories costreimbursable fixedprice and guaranteed maximum price the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the last five fiscal years 

 

 in accordance with industry practice most of our contracts including those with the us federal government are subject to termination at the discretion of the client in such situations our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination 

when we are directly responsible for engineering design procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client’s plant or facility we reflect the costs of materials equipment and subcontracts in both revenues and costs on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs the following table sets forth the approximate amount of such passthrough costs included in revenues for each of the last five fiscal years in millions of dollars 

 

   

costreimbursable contracts 

costreimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit the profit element may be in the form of a simple markup applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee or a combination of a markup and a fee the fee element can also take several forms the fee may be a fixed amount as specified in the contract it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred or it may be an incentive fee based on targets milestones or performance factors defined in the contract in general we prefer costreimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price 

fixedprice contracts 

fixedprice contracts include both “lump sum bid” contracts and “negotiated fixedprice” contracts under lump sum bid contracts we typically bid against other contractors based on specifications the client furnishes this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period additionally it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients which is contrary to our relationshipbased business model accordingly lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract in contrast under a negotiated fixedprice contract we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client negotiated fixedprice contracts frequently exist in singleresponsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project thus although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us however because of economies that may be realized during the contract term both negotiated fixedprice and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts over the past five years most of our fixedprice work has been either negotiated fixedprice contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services rather than turnkey construction 

guaranteed maximum price contracts 

guaranteed maximum price contracts are performed in the same manner as costreimbursable contracts however the total actual cost plus the fee cannot exceed the guaranteed price negotiated with the client if the total actual cost of the contract exceeds the guaranteed maximum price then we will bear at least some if not all of the excess in those cases where the total actual cost and fee are less than the guaranteed price we will often share the savings on a predetermined basis with the client these contracts are not our preferred form of contract because we believe they often contribute to an adversarial relationship with clients which is contrary to our relationshipbased business model

 item 1a risk factors tableend construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces if we fail to maintain safe work sites we can be exposed to significant financial losses as well as civil and criminal liabilities 

construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment moving vehicles chemical and manufacturing processes and highly regulated materials on many sites we are responsible for safety and accordingly must implement safety procedures if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective our employees and others may become injured unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover increase the cost of a project to our clients and raise our operating costs any of the foregoing could result in financial losses which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials which if improperly handled or disposed of could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health safety and environmental “hse” work procedures throughout our organization including construction sites and maintenance sites the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability 

our safety record is critical to our reputation many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures as a result our failure to maintain adequate safety standards could result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

negative conditions in the credit and financial markets could impair our ability to operate our business implement our acquisition strategy and access our cash and shortterm investments 

although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions in addition some of our clients depend of the availability of credit to help finance their capital projects due to the continuing instability of the credit markets in the us and abroad the availability of credit has continued to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain in spite of government efforts to increase liquidity and hold or reduce interest rates this situation could negatively impact our clients’ ability to fund their projects and therefore utilize our services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors suppliers and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are therefore subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices in weak economic environments we may experience increased delays 

  

and failures due to among other reasons a diminution in our clients’ access to the credit markets if one or more clients delays in paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

furthermore our cash balances and shortterm investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america europe and asia some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership or have been seized by their governments there is a risk that this may occur in the future if this were to occur we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund operations 

our vulnerability to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our clients operate is exacerbated during economic downturns 

we provide technical professional construction and om services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration production and refining programs for various national governments including the us federal government chemicals and polymers pharmaceuticals and biotechnology infrastructure buildings and other general industrial and consumer businesses and markets such as technology and manufacturing pulp and paper food and consumer products and mining and minerals these markets and the resulting demand for our services have been and we expect will continue to be cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control including economic conditions and changes in client spending particularly during periods of economic uncertainty 

current global economic conditions have negatively impacted our clients’ ability and willingness to fund their projects they have also caused our clients to reduce their capital expenditures alter the mix of services purchased seek more favorable price and other contract terms and otherwise slow their spending on our services for example the precipitous increase in crude oil prices followed by their collapse in calendar year 2008 caused several of our clients operating in the upstream oil and gas market to reexamine a number of their large capital projects which resulted in delays and cancellations of contracts previously awarded to us in the public sector declines in state tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending these conditions have reduced the demand for our services which has had a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations 

current economic conditions also make it extremely difficult for our clients our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could cause businesses to continue to slow spending on our services we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery worldwide or in our clients’ markets in addition our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and therefore may not recover as quickly as the economy at large a continuation or worsening of current weak economic conditions or a reduction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

regardless of economic or market conditions investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients’ markets and investment decisions as a result our past results have varied considerably and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate 

fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customer’s investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation delays in existing work or changes in the timing and funding of new awards 

commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways for example for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil gas copper or fertilizers fluctuations in price can have a direct effect 

  

on their profitability and cash flow and therefore their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments to the extent our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects the demand for our services decreases which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned as well as those in progress and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel 

the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel including engineers architects designers craft personnel and corporate management professionals who have the required experience and expertise from time to time it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients in certain geographic areas for example we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel 

in addition as some of our key personnel approach retirement age we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the cost of providing our services including the extent to which we utilize our workforce affects our profitability for example the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts if an expected contract award is delayed or not received we could incur cost resulting from excess staff reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business financial conditions and results of operations 

the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the nature of our business sometimes results in clients subcontractors and vendors presenting claims to us for among other things recovery of costs related to certain projects similarly we occasionally present change orders and other claims to our clients subcontractors and vendors if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients subcontractors and vendors we could incur cost overruns reduced profits or in some cases a loss for a project additionally irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant 

we are a party to litigation in the normal course of business most litigation with which we are involved as a defendant relates to workers’ compensation personal injury environmental employmentlabor professional liability and similar matters we can be exposed to claims and litigation if for example there is a failure at any of the projects for which we have provided engineering or other services such claims could relate to among other things personal injury loss of life business interruption property damage pollution and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties such as those who use or reside near our clients’ projects we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards and those standards are not met in many of our contracts with clients subcontractors and vendors we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages penalties losses and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts 

  

we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations our insurance programs have varying coverage limits and maximums in addition we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under these programs as a result we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured our insurers are also subject to business risk and as a result one or more of them may be unable to fulfill their insurance obligations due to insolvency or otherwise 

pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability product liability criminal liability warranty obligations and other liabilities which to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties restrictions and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities and profit and cost controls government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding contracts with the us federal government for example are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for government programs may even be eliminated as a result our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues those with the us federal government represented approximately 254 of our total revenue in fiscal 2010 the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition since government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socioeconomic requirements we must comply with such requirements for example for contracts with the us federal government we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation the truth in negotiations act the cost accounting standards the service contract act and dod security regulations we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices environmental protection recordkeeping and accounting these regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and in some instances impose additional costs on our business operations government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than nongovernment contracts this includes for example unlimited indemnification obligations 

we also are subject to government audits investigations and proceedings and socalled “qui tam” actions brought by individuals or the government under the us federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws for example government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations these audits can result in adjustments to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies 

if we violate a rule or regulation fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit a variety of penalties can be imposed including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties in addition any or all of our government contracts could be terminated we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work or payment of our costs could be disallowed the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we bear the risk of cost overruns in fixedprice and guaranteed maximum price contracts we may experience reduced profits or in some cases losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates 

for fiscal 2010 approximately 14 of our revenues were earned under contracts that were either fixedprice or guaranteed maximum price in nature for these contracts we bear the risk of paying some if not all of any cost overruns under fixedprice and guaranteed maximumprice contracts contract prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions including those about future economic conditions prices and availability of labor equipment and materials and other exigencies if these estimates prove inaccurate there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications or if circumstances change due to among other things unanticipated technical problems difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals changes in local laws or labor conditions weather delays changes in the costs of raw materials or our vendors’ or subcontractors’ inability to perform then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or in some cases a loss for that project if the project is significant or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted cancelled or suspended by our clients and therefore our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings additionally even if fully performed our backlog may not be a good indicator of our future gross margins 

as of the end of fiscal 2010 our backlog totaled approximately 132 billion there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or if realized will result in profits in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation termination or suspension at the discretion of the client in addition the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts our backlog includes expected revenues for contracts that are based on estimates projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns 

additionally the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence future profitability in some markets there is a continuing trend towards costreimbursable contracts with incentivefee arrangements typically our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs overall safety performance overall client satisfaction and other performance criteria if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards we may receive a lower or even zero incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins accordingly there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog assuming they produce the revenues currently expected will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past 

our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control 

as is common in the industry we perform certain contracts as a member of joint ventures partnerships and similar arrangements this situation exposes us to a number of risks including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients our partners may also be unable or unwilling to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships if these circumstances occur we may be required to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages provide additional services or make additional investments to ensure adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services under agreements with joint and several liabilities we could be liable for both our obligations and those of our partners these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

  

in addition we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner in these cases we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture in addition these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts 

much of the work performed under our contracts is performed by thirdparty subcontractors we hire we also rely on thirdparty equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired if the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated especially in a lumpsum or a fixedprice contract we may suffer losses on these contracts if a subcontractor supplier or manufacturer fails to provide services supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason we may be required to source these services equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or at a higher price than anticipated which could impact contract profitability 

in the current economic environment thirdparties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party’s ability to provide materials equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

maintaining adequate bonding capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win fixedprice contracts 

in line with industry practice we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds to our customers these bonds indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract if a bond is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond we cannot pursue that project 

historically we have had adequate bonding capacity but as is typically the case the issuance of a bond is at the surety’s sole discretion in addition because of an overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms our inability to obtain adequate bonding and as a result to bid on new contracts that require such bonding could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we fail to comply with federal state local or foreign governmental requirements our business may be adversely affected 

we are subject to us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business for example we are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost violations of regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities 

various us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or 

  

previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants the liability under these laws is joint and several we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen cleanup obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

when we perform our services our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions we may be subject to liability claims by employees customers and third parties as a result of such exposures in addition we may be subject to fines penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws a claim if not covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

such laws regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could for example relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and in turn could negatively impact our revenue our failure to comply with such laws or regulations whether actual or alleged could expose us to fines penalties or potential litigation liabilities including costs settlements and judgments any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments which may require us or our clients to obtain and to comply with federal state and local government permits and approvals any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial revocation or modification under various circumstances failure to obtain or comply with or the loss or modification of the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and result of operations 

our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders although we have policies and procedures to comply with us and foreign international trade laws the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and could damage our reputation and therefore our ability to do business 

employee agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts which could result in reduced revenues and profits 

misconduct fraud noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or other improper activities by one of our employees agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations regulations regarding the protection of classified information regulations prohibiting bribery and other foreign corrupt practices regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts regulations on lobbying or similar activities regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting environmental laws and any other applicable laws or regulations for example we regularly provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters if a security breach were to occur our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective and we could face unknown risks or losses our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices if we are found to be liable for fcpa violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the loss of one or a few customers could have an adverse impact on us 

a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue andor backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years for example in fiscal 2010 fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 approximately 254 203 and 168 respectively of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government although we have longstanding relationships with many of our significant clients our clients may unilaterally reduce delay or cancel their contracts at any time our loss of business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we engage in a highly competitive business if we are unable to compete effectively we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

we face intense competition to provide technical professional and construction services to clients the extent of such competition varies by industry geographic market and project type for example with respect to our construction and operations and maintenance services clients generally award large projects to large contractors which may give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects conversely with respect to our engineering design architectural and consulting services low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller newer competitors if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both which if significant could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our larger competitors for engineering construction and maintenance services for process plants include bechtel fluor foster wheeler kbr aker kvaerner technip worleyparsons the shaw group and amec in the area of buildings our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr hok aecom and turner in the area of infrastructure our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as urs parsons brinckerhoff hntb tetra tech parsons and ws atkins in the area of national government programs our principal competitors include several of the competitors listed above as well as saic ch2m hill weston lockheed martin and computer sciences corporation 

in addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in risk factors our international operations are also exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies 

for fiscal 2010 approximately 30 of our revenues was earned from clients outside the us our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues at a minimum our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects both positive and negative that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar into the us dollar in addition our international operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic political and other conditions our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties 

our business strategy involves growth through among other things the acquisition of other companies acquiring companies presents a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us the current credit markets may make it more difficult and costly to finance acquisitions acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 

  

in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make we could dilute share ownership 

one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities accordingly we filed a shelf registration statement on form s4 on december 7 2007 if we issue additional equity securities pursuant to this shelf registration statement or otherwise such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders’ individual ownership percentages in the company 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock because of a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements 

in preparing our financial statements our management is required under accounting principles generally accepted in the us to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities areas requiring significant estimates by our management include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

an impairment charge of goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

under accounting principles generally accepted in the us we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach rather than amortizing it over time as of october 1 2010 we had 11 billion of goodwill representing 239 of our total assets of 47 billion we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business potential government actions toward our facilities and other factors 

if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value we could be required to record an impairment charge the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing please see item 7— management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 

rising inflation interest rates andor construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts in particular with respect to our fixedprice contracts 

rising inflation interest rates or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services in addition we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixedprice and may be at risk to the effects of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are guaranteed maximumprice because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from costreimbursable type contracts approximately 86 during fiscal 2010 the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor however if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixedprice and lumpsum work is more prevalent inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future therefore increases in inflation interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control 

we are a delaware corporation certain antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us in addition certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover for example 

 

  

  

  

 these types of provisions as well as our shareholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders accordingly stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend critical accounting policies 

in order to understand better the changes that occur to key elements of our financial condition results of operations and cash flows a reader of this management’s discussion and analysis “mda” should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business performing longterm engineering and constructiontype contracts requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect both the entity’s results of operations and the carrying values of its assets and liabilities although our significant accounting polices are described in note 2— significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k the following discussion is intended to highlight and describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue accounting for contracts and use of joint ventures —in general we recognize revenues at the time we provide services depending on the commercial terms of the contract we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred or using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion this method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress in making such estimates judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule the cost of materials and labor productivity and the impact of change orders liability claims contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee in some of the markets we serve there is an increasing trend towards costreimbursable contracts with incentivefee arrangements in certain instances we base our incentive fees on achievement of target completion dates target costs andor other performance criteria failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or nonrecoverable costs which could exceed revenues recognized from the project 

we provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known without regard to the percentage of completion 

the nature of our business sometimes results in clients subcontractors or vendors presenting claims to us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible in those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract we include in the total estimated costs of the contract and therefore the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract an estimate based on all relevant facts and circumstances available of the additional costs to be incurred similarly and in the normal course of business we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible in those situations where we have presented such claims to our clients we include in revenues the amount of costs incurred without profit to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims 

certain costreimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment in this situation revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts in those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs that are not allowable under the terms of the contract we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly 

  

as is common in the industry we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures and consortiums for certain of these joint ventures ie where we have an undivided interest in the assets and liabilities of the venture we recognize our proportionate share of joint venture revenues costs and operating profit in our consolidated statements of earnings for other investments in engineering and construction joint ventures we use the equity method of accounting 

accounting for stock issued to employees and others —we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the estimated grantdate fair value of the award 

we use the blackscholes option pricing model to compute the grant date fair value of awards of equity instruments the blackscholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions in order to compute the hypothetical fair value of a stock option changes in these assumptions can cause drastically different values being assigned to a stock option the value assigned to any stock options that may be awarded in the future as well as the related expense associated with any such awards will be dependent on the assumptions used at the time of award 

accounting for pension plans —the accounting for pension plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans’ assets and liabilities these assumptions include discount rates investment returns and projected salary increases among others the actuarial assumptions used in determining the funded statuses of the plans are provided in note 7— pension plans of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

the expected rates of return on plan assets for fiscal 2010 ranged from 22 to 80 this compares to a range of 23 to 80 for fiscal 2009 we believe the range of rates we applied for fiscal 2010 reflects the longterm returns expected on the plans’ assets considering recent market conditions projected rates of inflation the diversification of the plans’ assets and the expected real rates of market returns the discount rates used to compute plan liabilities were changed from a range of 25 to 56 in fiscal 2009 to a range of 21 to 51 in fiscal 2010 these assumptions represent the company’s best estimate of the rates at which its pension obligations could be effectively settled 

changes in the actuarial assumptions often have a material affect on the values assigned to plan assets and liabilities and the associated pension expense for example if the discount rate used to value the our net pension benefit obligation “pbo” at october 1 2010 was higher lower by 10 the pbo would have been lower higher at that date by approximately 1820 million and the net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2010 would be lower higher by approximately 70 million similarly if the expected return on plan assets were increased decreased by 10 the net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2011 would decrease increase by approximately 79 million differences between actuarial assumptions and actual performance ie actuarial gains and losses that are not recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost in the period in which such differences arise are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are recognized as part of net periodic pension cost in future periods in accordance with us gaap management monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in an effort to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used 

contractual guarantees litigation investigations and insurance —in the normal course of business we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation the guarantees to which we are a party generally relate to project schedules and plant performance most of the litigation in which we are involved has us as a defendant in workers’ compensation personal injury environmental employmentlabor professional liability and other similar lawsuits we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations we have elected however to retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under our insurance programs this situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured and we intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of our contracts 

  

in accordance with us gaap we record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such guarantees litigation and insurance claims we include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations 

in addition as a contractor providing services to the united states federal government and several of its agencies we are subject to many levels of audits investigations and claims by or on behalf of the us federal government with respect to contract performance pricing costs cost allocations and procurement practices we adjust revenues based upon the amounts we expect to realize considering the effects of any client audits or governmental investigations 

testing goodwill for possible impairment —the goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets is tested annually for possible impairment in performing the annual impairment test we evaluate our goodwill at the reporting unit level we have determined that we have two reporting units which are based on geography we refer to these reporting units internally as “europe” and “noneurope” each of our reporting units conducts the business activities described elsewhere in this 2010 form 10k which includes providing professional technical services such as design engineering and architectural services construction andor construction management services and maintenance and operations services 

our geographybased reporting units reflect the company’s organizational structure which is based predominately on geography as well as our acquisition strategy which favors acquisition targets that among other things provide access to new geographic areas our reporting units represent rational groupings into which substantially all of our major acquisitions which are responsible for the goodwill appearing in our consolidated balance sheet have been assimilated and all of the operations under each reporting unit share in the benefits of the goodwill created by our acquisitions 

us gaap does not prescribe a specific valuation method for estimating the fair value of reporting units we determined that a market approach is an appropriate method for valuing our reporting units in light of its common use as a technique for valuing businesses in general using this method the fair value of our reporting units was estimated by multiplying their respective aftertax earnings for the trailing twelve months by the company’s overall average market earnings multiple since the activities of each reporting unit approximates that of the company overall we concluded that the use of the company’s market multiple for purposes of applying the marketbased valuation approach was reasonable we also believe that the use of this multiple is appropriate considering that both reporting units have qualitative characteristics that are generally consistent with those of the parent company those characteristics include size in terms of resources ie personnel a large diverse client base broad geographic reach and a broad range of design engineering and construction and construction management capabilities 

the determination of reporting units and the selection of the valuation technique used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units requires the exercise of judgment by management the fair values resulting from the valuation technique used are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of the reporting units to willing third parties 

as mentioned above the key inputs used in the valuation model are the aftertax earnings of our reporting units and the company’s marketdriven average earnings multiple the multiples used for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 were approximately 14 15 and 31 respectively in the event either the aftertax earnings of the company’s reporting units or the company’s market earnings multiples decline significantly after the date the annual impairment test is performed the company will reperform the test at a date closer to fiscal yearend 

based on the most recent results of our annual impairment tests there were no indications of impairment of the goodwill shown in our consolidated balance sheets for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 

  

changes in the inputs used in our valuation model ie declines in the company’s average earnings multiple or the aftertax earnings of our reporting units could result in an indication of possible impairment of goodwill in the future 

fiscal 2010—overview 

there were two events that occurred during fiscal 2010 that significantly affected the comparability of the company’s consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2010 to its consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2009 and 2008 

 

  

 in this mda we discuss and analyze the company’s results of operations for fiscal 2010 before the effects of the houston sublease and the sivom judgment although such information is nonus gaap in nature it is presented because management believes it provides a better view of the company’s operating results for the readers of this annual report on form 10k to assess the company’s performance and operating trends 

  

the following table presents i the company’s consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2010 before the effects of the houston sublease and the sivom judgment which is nonus gaap ii the effects of the houston sublease and the sivom litigation and iii the company’s consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2010 in accordance with us gaap in thousands except earnings per share 

 

 the company’s operating results for fiscal 2010 continue to be impacted by the global recession which began affecting the company during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 the recession has caused many of our private sector clients to reexamine their capital expenditure plans resulting in the delay in the release of new projects and in certain instances cancellations of projects awarded to us previously these economic conditions have also had a negative effect on many of our public sector clients as we have seen spending reductions by federal and state governments and the delay and curtailment of key infrastructure programs 

the decline in revenues during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 occurred in most of the industries and markets we serve with respect to the various categories of services we provide the decline in revenues was more prevalent in the field services area of our business and reflects the general decrease during the year in the amount of passthrough costs we incurred on our projects 

as discussed in last year’s mda we implemented certain costcontrol measures last year in response to the effects of the recession we reduced personnel and closed or reconfigured a number of our offices the results of these actions contributed to a 105 million reduction in selling general and administrative “sga” expenses although we continue to look for opportunities to reduce or minimize our operating costs there is no guaranty that we will be able to identify additional opportunities and make further reductions 

on the other hand we are a very diversified business we provide a widerange of services to customers operating in a wide range of industries and markets accordingly we continue to believe that as the global economy begins to recover and depending on which industries and markets start their recovery first we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on whatever increased capital spending occurs both domestically and 

  

internationally our cash and cash equivalents totaled 9388 million at october 1 2010 our debttoequity ratio was 28 at the end of fiscal 2010 and we have over 2571 million available under our various credit facilities 

results of operations 

general 

our business focuses exclusively on providing technical professional and construction services to a large number of industrial commercial and governmental clients around the world the services we provide generally fall into four broad categories 

 

  

  

  

 the scope of services we can provide our clients therefore ranges from consulting and conceptual design services which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project to complete singleresponsibility designbuild contracts to services required in the post startup phases of a project such as maintenance and operations services 

the following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each of the last three fiscal years in thousands 

 

  

   

we focus our services on clients operating in certain industry groups and markets we believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit crossutilization of our resources the following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each of the last three fiscal years in thousands 

 

  

   fiscal 2010 before the effects of the houston sublease and the sivom judgment compared to fiscal 2009 

we recorded net earnings of 3121 million or 248 per diluted share for the fiscal year ended october 1 2010 compared to net earnings of 3999 million or 321 per diluted share for fiscal 2009 

revenues for the fiscal year ended october 1 2010 totaled 99 billion and represents a decrease of 15 billion or 133 as compared to 115 billion for fiscal 2009 

revenues during fiscal 2010 from projects for clients operating in many of the industry groups and markets we serve were significantly lower as compared to fiscal 2009 the larger decreases occurred in the refining—downstream oil  gas—upstream and the pharmaceuticals and biotechnology industry groups and markets these declines relate to the normal windingdown and completion of large projects combined with the lack of new project awards these industry groups and markets have also been significantly impacted by the global recession causing many clients to reexamine their capital expenditure plans resulting in the delay in the release of new projects and in certain instances cancellations of projects awarded to us previously also contributing to the decline in revenues within these industry groups and markets was a 13 billion or 322 decrease in passthrough costs discussed below 

in contrast revenues during fiscal 2010 from projects for national government program clients increased by 1659 million or 77 as compared to last year most of the increase relates to revenues from the us federal government on projects for research and development test engineering scientific other technical services projects 

  

similarly revenues during fiscal 2010 relating to buildings projects increased by 762 million or 96 as compared to last year the increase relates to spending for the design of technical buildings 

for the fiscal year 2010 we earned 1768 million in revenues for projects funded by the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 

direct costs of contracts for fiscal 2010 decreased 14 billion or 140 to 85 billion compared to 99 billion for fiscal 2009 the level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors including the amount of passthrough costs we incur during a period on those projects where we are responsible for subcontract labor or thirdparty materials and equipment we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs and we refer to such costs as “passthrough costs” on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not considered passthrough costs and are therefore not reflected in either revenues or costs to the extent that we incur a significant amount of passthrough costs in a period our direct cost of contracts are likely to increase as well 

passthrough costs for fiscal 2010 decreased 13 billion or 322 to 27 billion compared to 40 billion for fiscal 2009 in general passthrough costs are more significant on projects that have a higher content of field services activities field services revenues for fiscal 2010 decreased 11 billion or 186 to 48 billion compared to 59 billion for fiscal 2009 passthrough costs are generally incurred at a specific point in the lifecycle of a project and are highly dependent on the needs of our individual clients and the nature of the clients’ projects however because we have hundreds of projects which start at various times within a fiscal year the effect of passthrough costs on the level of direct costs of contracts can vary between fiscal years without there being a fundamental or significant change to the underlying business 

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts were 857 for fiscal 2010 compared to 864 for fiscal 2009 the relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided generally speaking the more procurement we do on behalf of our clients ie where we purchase equipment and materials for use on projects andor procure subcontracts in connection with projects and the more field services revenues we have relative to technical professional services revenues the higher the ratio will be of direct costs of contracts to revenues because revenues from passthrough costs typically have lower margin rates associated with them it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in such revenues without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit the decrease in the ratio of direct costs of contracts to revenues in fiscal 2010 as compared to last year was due primarily to lower levels of passthrough costs 

sga expenses for fiscal 2010 decreased by 105 million or 11 to 9298 million compared to 9403 million for fiscal 2009 our sga expenses typically fluctuate as a result of changes in headcount and the amount of spending required to support our technical professional services activities which normally require additional overhead costs therefore when our technical professional services revenues increase or decrease it is not unusual to see a corresponding change in sga expenses the decrease in sga expenses during fiscal 2010 was due primarily to management’s efforts to reduce sga expenses 

operating profit for fiscal 2010 decreased by 1332 million or 215 to 4874 million compared to 6206 million for fiscal 2009 as a percentage of revenues operating profit was 49 for fiscal 2010 compared to 54 in fiscal 2009 this decrease in operating profit is due primarily to the overall decline in business volume 

interest income for fiscal 2010 decreased by 95 million to 36 million compared to 131 million for fiscal 2009 even though the company maintained significant cash balances during fiscal 2010 the rate of interest earned on our deposits and investments was significantly lower in 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 

  

interest expense for fiscal 2010 was nearly zero compared to 29 million for fiscal 2009 the decrease in interest expense was due primarily to the reversal of 29 million of interest expense that was accrued over the past several years in connection with an income tax matter that was resolved successfully in fiscal 2010 

the company’s consolidated effective income tax rate was 360 for fiscal 2010—unchanged from fiscal 2009 in the normal course of our business we may engage in numerous transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in income or deducted as an expense is uncertain additionally we file income franchise gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service most states in the united states and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the united states we continually monitor the appropriateness of the rate and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will change 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

the company’s fiscal year ends on the friday closest to september 30 determined on the basis of the number of workdays and accordingly an additional week of activity is added every five to six years such as in fiscal 2009 

we recorded net earnings of 3999 million or 321 per diluted share for the fiscal year ended october 2 2009 compared to net earnings of 4207 million or 338 per diluted share for fiscal 2008 

although consolidated revenues for fiscal 2009 increased by 2152 million or 19 from fiscal 2008 most of the increase occurred during the first two quarters of fiscal 2009 as the company completed a number of projects for clients operating in several of the industries and markets we serve during the second half of fiscal 2009 as the global economy continued to slow revenues droppedoff significantly while project delays increased and awards of new contracts also slowed 

revenues during fiscal 2009 from projects for clients operating in the refining—downstream and the oil  gas—upstream industries increased a total of 1174 million or 25 from fiscal 2008 all of the increase related to projects for clients operating in the energy  refinery sector and reflects the rampingup of work performed at a large us oil refinery this increase was offset in part by the windingdown of work on certain projects in the upstream sector of the petroleum market that were awarded to the company in prior years when oil prices were at historically high levels 

revenues during fiscal 2009 from projects for national government program clients increased by 3645 million or 204 from fiscal 2008 most of the increase continues to relate to revenues from the us federal government on projects for research and development test engineering scientific and other technical services although the company performed services during fiscal 2009 for projects that were funded in part under the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 “arra” such revenues were not significant 

revenues during fiscal 2009 from projects for clients operating in the chemicals and polymers industries and the pharmaceuticals and biotechnology industries as well as the buildings market all declined as compared to fiscal 2008 as clients reviewed their capital expenditure plans in light of the global recession and delayed the release of new projects 

direct costs of contracts for fiscal 2009 increased 3888 million or 41 to 99 billion compared to 95 billion for fiscal 2008 the level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors including the amount of passthrough cost we incur during a period on those projects where we are responsible for subcontract labor or thirdparty materials and equipment we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs and we refer to such costs as “passthrough costs” on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these 

  

amounts are not considered passthrough costs and are therefore not reflected in either revenues or costs to the extent that we incur a significant amount of passthrough costs in a period our direct cost of contracts are likely to increase as well 

passthrough costs for fiscal 2009 increased 4996 million or 142 to 40 billion compared to 35 billion for fiscal 2008 in general passthrough costs are more significant on projects that have a higher content of field services activities field services revenues for fiscal 2009 increased 5754 million or 107 to 59 billion compared to 54 billion for fiscal 2008 passthrough costs are generally incurred at a specific point in the lifecycle of a project and are highly dependent on the needs of our individual clients and the nature of the clients’ projects however because we have hundreds of projects which start at various times within a fiscal year the effect of passthrough costs on the level of direct costs of contracts can vary between fiscal years without there being a fundamental or significant change to the underlying business 

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts were 864 for fiscal 2009 compared to 846 for fiscal 2008 the relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided generally speaking the more procurement we do on behalf of our clients ie where we purchase equipment and materials for use on projects andor procure subcontracts in connection with projects and the more field services revenues we have relative to technical professional services revenues the higher the ratio will be of direct costs of contracts to revenues because revenues from passthrough costs typically have lower margin rates associated with them it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in such revenues without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit the increase in the ratio of direct costs of contracts to revenues in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was due primarily to higher levels of passthrough costs combined with a slight decrease in the margin rates earned on our technical professional services revenues 

sga expenses for fiscal 2009 decreased by 1511 million or 138 to 9403 million compared to 11 billion for fiscal 2008 our sga expenses typically fluctuate as a result of changes in head count and the spending required to support our technical professional services revenues which normally require additional overhead costs therefore when our technical professional services revenues increase or decrease we typically see a corresponding change in sga expenses the decrease in sga expenses was due primarily to the decline in our project services revenues combined with management’s efforts to reduce sga expenses 

operating profit for fiscal 2009 decreased by 225 million or 35 to 6206 million compared to 6431 million for fiscal 2008 as a percentage of revenues operating profit was 54 for fiscal 2009 compared to 57 in fiscal 2008 this decrease in operating profit is due primarily to the overall decline in business volume and in particular the decrease in project services revenues 

interest income for fiscal 2009 decreased by 23 million or 149 to 131 million compared to 154 million for fiscal 2008 even though the company maintained higher average cash balances during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 the rate of interest earned on our deposits and investments was significantly lower in 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 

interest expense for fiscal 2009 decreased by 15 million or 339 to 29 million compared to 44 million for fiscal 2008 the decrease in interest expense was due primarily to lower average borrowings outstanding during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 

miscellaneous expense net for fiscal 2009 totaled 67 million as compared to miscellaneous income net of 39 million for fiscal 2008 included in miscellaneous income net in fiscal 2008 was a 106 million gain from the sale of the company’s interest in a business that provides specialized operations and maintenance services for highways and associated facilities by excluding the gain from fiscal 2008 miscellaneous expense net for fiscal 2008 would have been 67 million 

  

we recorded income tax expense of 2249 million during fiscal 2009 compared to 2367 million during fiscal 2008 our overall effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 was 36—the same as fiscal 2008 

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth certain information about our contractual obligations as of october 1 2010 in thousands 

 

  

    backlog 

backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us with respect to om contracts however we include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for only one succeeding year regardless of the remaining life of the contract for national government programs other than us federal om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding option periods 

the following table summarizes our backlog for each of the last three fiscal years in millions 

 

 because the entire value of a contract is added to backlog as soon as the contract is awarded to us rather than adding the contracts to backlog gradually over time and because many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years we evaluate our backlog on a yearoveryear basis rather than on a sequential quarteroverquarter basis our backlog at october 1 2010 decreased by 20 billion or 133 to 132 billion from 152 billion at october 2 2009 

  

in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 adjustments were made to a variety of extended term task order indefinite quantity and other similar contracts where it became clear that the full capacity of the previouslyrecorded backlog amount would not be realized such negative adjustments totaled approximately 3900 million and affected technical professional services during fiscal 2009 approximately 19 billion was removed from backlog as a result of project cancellations approximately 24 billion was removed from backlog during fiscal 2008 relating to cancelled projects in a situation where a client terminates a contract we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and in certain instances we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs there were no significant project cancellations in fiscal 2010 

while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein accordingly backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenues 

backlog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies totaled approximately 43 billion or 326 of total backlog 42 billion or 277 of total backlog and 34 billion or 204 of total backlog at october 1 2010 october 2 2009 and september 26 2008 respectively most of our federal contracts require that services be provided beyond one year in general these contracts must be funded annually ie the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the us congress to the procuring agency and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts 

subject to the factors discussed in item 1a— risk factors  above we estimate that approximately 69 billion or 523 of total backlog at october 1 2010 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year 

effects of inflation 

the effects of inflation on our business is discussed in detail in item 1a— risk factors  and is incorporated herein by reference 

liquidity and capital resources 

the three more significant andor nonrecurring uses of cash during fiscal 2010 was approximately 2595 million for acquisitions of businesses net of cash acquired approximately 2362 million more than what was spent for acquisitions during fiscal 2009 approximately 1085 million for purchases of investments approximately 745 million more than what was spent for investments during fiscal 2009 and approximately 645 million representing the net cash outflow relating to the sivom judgment in spite of the 4325 million of cash used for these transactions and events our cash and cash equivalents decreased by only 948 million during fiscal 2010 this compares to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of 4292 million during fiscal 2009 and a decrease of 89 million during fiscal 2008 during fiscal 2010 we generated net cash inflows of 1970 million from operating activities and 956 million from financing activities these inflows were offset in part by outflows from investing activities and the effect of exchange rate changes of 3744 million and 130 million respectively 

our operations provided net cash of 1970 million during fiscal 2010 this compares to net cash inflows of 5335 million and 3134 million during fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively the 3365 million decrease in cash provided by operations in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was due primarily to the following factors 

 

  

 with respect to the 1883 million decrease in cash flows relating to changes in our working capital accounts there was no unusual activity occurring in these accounts during fiscal 2010 because such a high 

  

percentage of our revenues are earned on costplus type contracts 86 and 85 of total revenues for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 respectively and due to the significance of revenues relating to passthrough costs most of the costs we incur are included in invoices we send to clients although we continually monitor our accounts receivable we manage the operating cash flows of the company by managing the working capital accounts in total rather than by the individual elements the primary elements of the company’s working capital accounts are accounts receivable accounts payable and billings in excess of cost accounts payable consists of obligations to third parties relating primarily to costs incurred for projects which are generally billable to clients receivable consist of amounts owed to us by our clients—a substantial portion of which is for projectrelated costs billings in excess of costs consist of billings to and payments from our clients for costs yet to be incurred 

this relationship between revenues and costs and between receivables and payables is unique for our industry and facilitates reviews of cash flow information at the total working capital level the 1883 million decrease in cash flows relating to changes in our working capital accounts was due primarily to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts and reflects the general decline of the overall business in fiscal 2010 as compared to the prior year 

we used 3744 million of cash and cash equivalents for investing activities during fiscal 2010 this compares to net cash outflows of 949 million and 4099 million during fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively the 2794 million increase in cash used for investing activities as compared to fiscal 2009 was due primarily to acquisitions of businesses and changes in investments during fiscal 2010 we acquired jordan jones  goulding inc and tybrin corporation and we completed our investment in awe management limited 

our financing activities resulted in net cash inflows of 956 million during fiscal 2010 this compares to net cash outflows of 390 million during fiscal 2009 and net cash inflows of 988 million during fiscal 2008 the 1346 million net increase in cash flows from financing activities during fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 was due primarily to an 879 million change in the company’s borrowing activities along with a 545 million change in other deferred liabilities relating primarily to the company’s defined benefit pension plans 

we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations and service our debt for the next twelve months we had 9388 million in cash and cash equivalents at october 1 2010 compared to 10 billion at october 2 2009 our consolidated working capital position at october 1 2010 was 153 billion compared to 152 billion at october 2 2009 which management believes is adequate we have a longterm unsecured revolving credit facility providing up to 2900 million of debt capacity under which approximately 329 million was utilized at october 1 2010 in the form of letters of credit only we also have a shortterm credit facility inplace at october 1 2010 providing 794 million of debt capacity which was entirely utilized as of that date we believe that the capacity terms and conditions of our committed credit facilities combined with other uncommitted facilities we have in place are adequate for our working capital and general business requirements depending on the size of any business acquisition we complete in the future and the timing of when any such transaction may close our current cash balances and existing credit facilities may not be sufficient to provide the amount of liquidity we may need we believe however that we will be able to access the capital markets and fund future acquisitions if and when the need arises 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are party to financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk in the form of guarantees not reflected in our balance sheet that arise in the normal course of business however such offbalance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or resources that is material to investors see note 10— commitments and contingencies and derivative financial instruments of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” 200913— multipledeliverable revenue arrangements  which amends certain guidance in accounting standards codification “asc” 60525 revenue recognition— multiple element arrangements  asu 200913 requires entities to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a selling price hierarchy the amendments eliminate the residual method of revenue allocation and require revenue to be allocated using the relative selling price method asu 200913 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after june 15 2010 and should be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified with early adoption permitted the company is currently evaluating the impact of asu 200913 if any on its consolidated financial statements 

in june 2009 the fasb issued sfas no 167—amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r as codified in asc 81010 asc 81010 requires the company to perform an analysis to determine whether its variable interests give the company a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity such analysis requires the company to assess whether it has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity and if it has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity asc 81010 eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and significantly enhances disclosures sfas 167 is effective for the company october 1 2010 the company is currently evaluating the impact of this statement if any on its consolidated financial statements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141r— business combinations as codified in asc 805 asc 805 significantly changes the accounting and reporting for business combinations among other changes asc 805 requires acquisition related costs to be recognized separately from the acquisition in a business combination achieved in stages an acquiree to recognize the identifiable assets liabilities and noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the full amounts of their fair values as of the acquisition date an acquirer to recognize assets or liabilities from contingencies as of the acquisition date the requirement to measure the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at fair value will result in recognizing the goodwill attributable to the noncontrolling interest in addition to that attributable to the acquirer asc 805 was effective for the company october 3 2009 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160— noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements—an amendment of arb no 51 as codified in asc 8101065 asc 8101065 significantly changes the accounting and reporting of noncontrolling formerly known as minority interests in consolidated financial statements among other changes asc 8101065 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements establishes that net income attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest will be reported in the consolidated statement of earnings and eliminates the requirement of purchase accounting for a parent’s acquisition of a noncontrolling ownership interest asc 8101065 was effective for the company october 3 2009 

depending on the size and nature of an acquisition the adoption of asc 81010 and asc 805 could have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk in the normal course of business our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

our only committed source for longterm credit is a 2900 million syndicated revolving credit facility there were no direct borrowings outstanding under this facility at october 1 2010 this agreement expires in 

  

may 2012 and provides for both fixedrate and variablerate borrowings our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we continuously monitor changes in interest rates and use cash provided from operations to repay our borrowings as quickly as possible furthermore the company can use a combination of both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk 

foreign currency risk 

in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency we attempt to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs in those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies we follow the provisions of asc 81510 in accounting for our derivative contracts the company does not currently have exchange rate sensitive instruments that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

the company’s management with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined by rule 13a15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of october 1 2010 the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k the “evaluation date” based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the evaluation date 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act management with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the evaluation date based on the framework established in “ internal control—integrated framework”  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management has concluded that the company’s internal controls overfinancial reporting as of the evaluation date were effective the company’s independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting which appears later in this annual report on form 10k 

changes in internal control 

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the company’s quarter ended october 1 2010 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

  

limitations on effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its system of internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed or operated can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of internal control are met the design of the company’s control system reflects the fact that there are resource constraints and that the benefits of such control system must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control failures and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the intentional acts of individuals by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that the design of any particular control will always succeed in achieving its objective under all potential future conditions

 item 1 business tableend general 

we are one of the largest technical professional services firms in the united states our business focuses exclusively on providing a broad range of technical professional and construction services to a large number of industrial commercial and governmental clients around the world we provide four broad categories of services 

 

  

  

  

 we provide our services through offices and subsidiaries located principally in north america europe the middle east asia and australia 

we concentrate our services on selected industry groups and markets including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

jacobs engineering group inc was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware on january 8 1987 on march 4 1987 the corporation succeeded by merger to the business and assets of jacobs engineering group inc a california corporation that in 1974 had succeeded to a business organized originally by our founder dr joseph j jacobs in 1947 unless the context otherwise requires all references herein to “jacobs” or the “registrant” are to jacobs engineering group inc and its predecessors and references to the “company” “we” “us” or “our” are to both jacobs engineering group inc and its consolidated subsidiaries the common stock of jacobs has been publicly held since 1970 and is currently listed on the new york stock exchange under the trading symbol jec 

business strategy 

general 

there are four major components of our business strategy 

 

  

  

  

 acquisitions play an important role in our business strategy as they allow us to expand on existing client relationships as well as develop new ones acquisitions also allow us the opportunity to leverage our cost structure across geographic areas 

safety and beyondzero ® 

most companies in our industry try to provide their employees with a safe and secure work environment they create safety programs insist on employee training and make every effort to build awareness we do this too but at jacobs we see safety differently 

in 2007 we introduced a concept we call beyondzero ®  a companywide initiative designed to educate and train our employees and to instill in them a culture of caring that follows them outside of the workplace or jobsite beyondzero ® has inspired our organization to a deeper richer emotional commitment to the safety of our employees their families their clients partners and friends and beyond 

a safe work environment is critical to our longterm success and growth we maintain a centralized quality and safety group to help ensure that the services we provide are delivered safely and in accordance with standard work processes unsafe job sites and office environments increase employee turnover increase the cost of a project to our clients expose us to types and levels of risk that are fundamentally unacceptable and increase our own operating costs as well 

we believe that we have a responsibility to go beyond these issues we have developed a true culture of caring where concern for our employees’ health and safety extends past office walls beyond the field and past the perception that injured employees simply cost the company time and money it’s about safekeeping 

safe job sites and office environments benefit our clients promote employee morale and enhance the longterm relationships we have with our clients employees and business partners 

  

relationshipbased business model 

our relationshipbased business model is central to our sustained growth and profitability we aggressively pursue the development of longterm affiliations and alliances with our clients by working as a partner with our clients on their capital programs we increase our understanding of their overall business needs as well as the unique technical requirements of their projects this increased understanding gives us the opportunity to provide a superior value to our clients we market all of our services to clients in connection with their projects where the scope of work required is within our expertise by integrating and bundling our services ie providing design engineering and construction services on the same project we can price contracts more competitively and enhance overall profitability while delivering additional value to our clients our relationshipbased business model also helps us more fully understand the risks inherent in our projects which in turn allows us to better manage those risks our approach also provides us with opportunities to market those services our clients will need in the post startup and commissioning phases of a plant such as operations and maintenance services this model however does not preclude us from undertaking discrete projects we will accept and perform discrete projects for our clients if we can negotiate acceptable pricing and other contract terms and conditions 

closely linked to our relationshipbased business model is our multidomestic geographic strategy for conducting business around the world as part of this strategy we act and operate as a local contractor in the geographic areas of the world in which we do business we believe it is important for us as a company to “be local” with respect to our network of offices and operations because our offices can generally sustain themselves with a base load of local work we’re able to support our multinational clients with their crossborder capital projects our core clients can depend on us for assistance with their engineering and construction needs when they move projects around the world our multidomestic strategy also allows us to be competitive around the world to the extent we win large projects and are able to perform meaningful portions of the project utilizing local resources rather than exporting the work to other offices within the group 

cost control 

our continual emphasis on cost control is an important component of our business model as the global economy expands and companies providing technical professional and construction services are required to compete against each other across geographic boundaries the company that can provide its clients with cost efficient solutions to their project needs has the advantage our attention to cost control throughout every level of our organization allows us to deliver superior technical professional and construction services safely efficiently and within the cost and time parameters our clients require 

organizational structure 

our organizational structure and integrated system for delivering services is another key component of our business strategy our operating units generally use a matrix organizational structure whereby our project management functions are supported by the various technical engineering design and construction disciplines that are necessary to effectively execute longterm engineering and construction contracts crucial functions such as project controls and procurement are embedded within each of our major offices and serve operations by providing specialized services required by projects in addition we actively employ a boundaryless approach to the way we serve our clients we do not maintain “profit centers” within the company nor do our operating groups compete against each other for contracts instead our organizational structure encourages our operating groups to work cohesively while simultaneously helping to reduce costs and promote an efficient delivery system for all of our services 

the role of acquisitions in our business strategy 

our relationshipbased business model is a significant driver of our acquisition strategy when we review potential acquisition targets we are conscious of the effect the acquisition may have on our client base we favor 

  

acquisitions that allow us to expand or enhance the range of services we provide existing clients andor gain access to new geographic areas in which our clients either already operate or plan to expand by expanding into new geographic areas and adding to our existing technical and project management capabilities we strive to position ourselves as a preferred singlesource provider of technical professional and construction services to our major clients the following is a brief description of some of our recent key acquisitions 

 

  

  

 in any particular year we will also make smaller acquisitions as opportunities arise 

services provided 

as described above the services we provide generally fall into the following four broad categories project services process scientific and systems consulting services construction services and operations and maintenance services the scope of services we can provide our clients therefore range from consulting and conceptual design services which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project to complete singleresponsibility designbuildoperate contracts 

the following table sets forth our revenues from each of our four service categories for each of the last five fiscal years in thousands of dollars 

 

 project services 

we employ all of the engineering design architectural and related disciplines necessary to design and engineer modern process plants including projects for clients in the chemicals and polymers pharmaceuticals and biotechnology oil  gas refining food and consumer products and basic resources industries buildings 

  

including facilities for clients in the health care education and criminal justice markets as well as other buildings for clients in the private sector infrastructure projects including highways roads bridges and other transportation systems water and wastewater treatment plants water resources facilities and other similar plants and facilities technology and manufacturing facilities for clients in the aerospace automotive defense semiconductor and electronics industries consumer products manufacturing facilities pulp and paper plants and other facilities we also employ many of the requisite scientific technical and program management capabilities necessary to provide program integration testing and evaluation services for clients in the defense and aerospace industries for the us department of defense “dod” in support of information systems for weapons acquisition centers for the national aeronautics and space administration “nasa” for aerospace testing and propulsion systems and facilities and for various other agencies of the us federal government in support of environmental programs 

we are capable of providing our clients with a variety of value engineering services including “safety in design” through safety in design we integrate best practices hazard analysis and risk assessment methods early in the design phase of projects taking those steps necessary to eliminate or mitigate injury and damage during the construction startup testing and commissioning and operations phases of a project 

in the area of construction management we provide our clients with a wide range of services as an agent for our clients we may act as the program director whereby we oversee on the owner’s behalf the complete planning design and construction phases of the project alternatively our services may be limited to providing construction consulting 

also included in the category of project services are certain related services such as planning scheduling procurement estimating cost engineering project accounting and quality and safety necessary to support our engineering design construction construction and program management operations and maintenance and consulting services 

process scientific and systems consulting 

we employ all of the professional and technical expertise necessary to provide a broad range of consulting services including performing pricing studies market analyses and financial projections necessary in determining the feasibility of a project performing gasoline reformulation modeling analyzing and evaluating layout and mechanical designs for complex processing plants analyzing automation and control systems analyzing designing and executing biocontainment strategies developing and performing process protocols with respect to the us food and drug administrationmandated qualification and validation requirements providing consultation on proposed railway and airport expansion projects and performing geological and metallurgical studies 

also included in this service category are the revenues relating to professional and program management services required to assist clients such as the us federal government and its agencies in a wide range of defense and aerospace related programs such services typically are more technical and scientific in nature than other project services we provide and may involve such tasks as supporting the development and testing of conventional weapons systems weapons modeling and simulations computer systems development maintenance and support evaluation and testing of missioncritical control systems and other highly technical programs and tasks 

construction 

we provide traditional field construction services to private and public sector clients in virtually all of the industry groups and markets to which we provide project services in the area of environmental remediation and restoration we provide environmental remedial construction services for a variety of public and private sector clients we also provide many of our clients with modular construction technology our modular construction 

  

technology is an advanced form of engineering and design offsite fabrication and assembly and field erection it provides our clients with an alternative approach to traditional methods of engineering and construction which can compress and shorten the construction schedule reduce risk and lower costs 

historically our field construction activities were focused primarily on those construction projects for which we perform much of the related engineering and design work by focusing our construction efforts on such projects we minimize the risks associated with constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared by third parties the financial risk to us of constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared by third parties may be particularly significant on fixedprice contracts therefore we generally avoid this type of project however we will pursue constructiononly projects when we can negotiate pricing and other contract terms we deem acceptable and which results in a fair return for the degree of risk we assume 

operations and maintenance “om” 

om generally refers to all of the tasks required to operate and maintain large complex facilities on behalf of clients we can provide key management and support services over all aspects of the operations of a facility including managing subcontractors and other onsite personnel within the environmental area om often includes engineering and technical support services as well as program management services necessary to remediate contaminated sites within the aerospace and defense areas om often requires us to provide the management and technical support services necessary to operate and maintain such sites as engine test facilities weapons integration facilities and hightech simulation and verification centers such om contracts also frequently require us to provide facilities management and maintenance services utilities operations and maintenance services property management and disposition services and construction support services 

om also includes process plant maintenance services which generally involves all of the tasks required to keep a process plant typically a refinery or chemical plant in daytoday operation such tasks could include the repair and replacement of pumps piping heat exchangers and other equipment as well as “turnaround” work which involves major refurbishment that can only be performed when the plant is shut down since shutdowns are expensive to the owners of the plant turnaround work often requires maximizing the number of skilled craft personnel who can work efficiently on a project on a 24hoursperday sevendaysperweek basis we use sophisticated computer scheduling and programming to complete turnaround projects quickly and we maintain contact with a large pool of skilled craft personnel we can hire as needed on maintenance and turnaround projects 

although the gross profit margins that we realize from om services are generally lower than those associated with the other services we provide the costs to support maintenance activities are also generally lower furthermore we view om contracts as presenting a lower financial risk to us as compared to some of the other services we provide because om contracts are normally costreimbursable in nature additionally although engineering and construction projects may be of a shortterm nature om services often result in longterm relationships with clients for example we have been providing maintenance services at several major process plants within the us for several decades this aspect of maintenance services greatly reduces the selling costs in respect of such services 

financial information about segments 

although we describe our business in this annual report on form 10k in terms of the services we provide the markets in which our clients operate and the geographic areas in which we operate we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the us in making this determination we considered various economic characteristics of our operations including the nature of the services we provide the nature of our internal processes for delivering and distributing those services and the types of customers we have in addition to the discussion that follows please refer to note 14— segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

there is a high degree of similarity of the workforces among our service categories for example engineering and design services ie services provided by persons who are degreed and in certain circumstances licensed professionals such as engineers architects scientists and economists exist in all four service categories in addition there is a high degree of similarity among a significant component of the workforces we employ to perform construction and om projects in providing construction and om services we employ a large number of skilled craft labor personnel these may include welders pipe fitters electricians crane operators and other personnel who work on very large capital projects in the case of projects classified within the construction services category or on smaller capital projects in the case of maintenance projects classified within the om services category 

our operating units use a matrix organizational structure our results therefore are dependent on groups representing technical disciplines eg electrical engineering mechanical engineering cost engineering etc supporting project management personnel who maintain the relationship between us and our clients and who are ultimately responsible for delivering projects to our clients safely on time and on budget additionally all of our operating regions and divisions use common tools policies and procedures to manage and run their respective units these include project review meetings project performance evaluations and project execution plans 

the use of technology throughout our organization is highly uniform whether it is pcbased computer aided design and drafting “cadd” applications used by our engineering and design staff or pcbased modeling programs used by the scientific and consulting staff or pcbased scheduling estimating and cost control applications used by homeoffice personnel in support of our construction and maintenance activities all of the service categories described above are equally affected by changes in technology as they occur in the economy at large 

furthermore the types of information and internal reports used by management to monitor performance evaluate results of operations allocate resources and otherwise manage the business support a single reportable segment accordingly based on these similarities we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment for purposes of the disclosures included in this annual report on form 10k 

industry groups and markets 

we provide our services to clients that operate in the following industry groups and markets energy and refining—downstream longterm programs for various national governments including the us chemicals and polymers oil and gas—upstream pharmaceuticals and biotechnology infrastructure buildings and other general industrial and consumer businesses and markets such as technology and manufacturing pulp and paper food and consumer products and mining and minerals we believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit crossutilization of our resources which helps to mitigate the negative effects of a downturn in a single industry 

the following table sets forth our revenues from each of the various industry groups and markets in which our clients operate for each of the last five fiscal years in thousands of dollars 

 

   

energy  refining—downstream 

we provide fullservice engineering design modular fabrication construction construction management and asset management and maintenance services to our clients in the energy and refining industries throughout the world we also provide a broad range of consulting services to our clients including process assessments facility appraisals feasibility studies technology evaluations project finance structuring and support and multiclient subscription services typical projects range in size from several million dollars to multibillion dollar facilities and include new design and construction revamps or expansions of existing plants turnarounds upgrades of individual process units within refineries and maintenance services 

our modular construction capabilities asset managementmaintenance services and formal client alliances help differentiate us in this sector many projects involve revamping existing processing units or adding new processes to an existing refinery as a result of the close proximity of processing units in these refineries using modular construction can decrease congestion at the construction site and can also provide safety cost and project execution benefits in remote locations 

in this industry group we also include power generation and cogeneration projects we provide technical assistance project management design engineering procurement construction and construction management and maintenance services to our clients in the power generation and supply industry and for power generating units within our clients’ process facilities typical projects include simple and combined cycle power projects cogeneration power plants aeroderivative and industrial gas turbines and emergency power generation stations 

oil  gas—upstream 

we provide fullservice engineering design construction modular fabrication maintenance and construction management services to our clients in the upstream areas of oil and gas exploration and production we also provide a broad range of consulting services to our clients including process assessments facility appraisals feasibility studies technology evaluations project finance structuring and support and multiclient subscription services many of our upstream projects are in north america europe and saudi arabia and include offshore platforms heavy oil processing eg oil sands thermal extraction projects oil recovery through steam injection and gas treating gas gathering and gas storage projects including extraction of commercially valuable elements of the gas stream 

typical projects involve the design and construction of projects that recover oil and gas and include oil thermal recovery facilities by either insitu means steam injection or steam assisted gravity drainage or aboveground oil sands mining upgraders pipelines and gas plants these are typically larger projects that may involve many of our offices and normally include our mumbai india office as a valueadded center to reduce client costs 

national government programs 

we categorize our national government programs as generally relating to environmental programs aerospace and defense programs or building programs 

environmental programs 

we provide environmental investigation restoration engineering construction and site operations and maintenance services to a number of united states federal government agencies including the department of energy “doe” and the dod we also provide these services to support the government of the united kingdom in its nuclear sites decommissioning program through the nuclear decommissioning authority “nda”

backlog 

for information regarding our backlog refer to item 7— management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  below 

significant customers 

the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government for each of the last five fiscal years 

 

 it is uncommon for a commercial customer to contribute 10 or more of the company’s total revenue on occasion however we will perform a number of field services projects for a single customer in the same fiscal year which primarily because of the amount of passthrough costs discussed below that is included in revenue will cause total revenue from that customer to exceed 10 of total consolidated revenues for the fiscal year ended october 2 2009 revenues earned from motiva enterprises llc accounted for 122 of total consolidated revenues and for the fiscal year ended september 29 2006 revenues earned from valero energy corporation accounted for 102 of total consolidated revenues 

financial information about geographic areas 

selected financial information regarding the geographic areas in which we operate is included in note 14— segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k and is incorporated herein by reference 

contracts 

while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake our contracts generally fall into three broad categories costreimbursable fixedprice and guaranteed maximum price the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the last five fiscal years 

 

 in accordance with industry practice most of our contracts including those with the us federal government are subject to termination at the discretion of the client in such situations our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination 

when we are directly responsible for engineering design procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client’s plant or facility we reflect the costs of materials equipment and subcontracts in both revenues and costs on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no 

  

associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs the following table sets forth the approximate amount of such passthrough costs included in revenues for each of the last five fiscal years in millions of dollars 

 

 costreimbursable contracts 

costreimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit the profit element may be in the form of a simple markup applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee or a combination of a markup and a fee the fee element can also take several forms the fee may be a fixed amount as specified in the contract it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred or it may be an incentive fee based on targets milestones or performance factors defined in the contract in general we prefer costreimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price 

fixedprice contracts 

fixedprice contracts include both “lump sum bid” contracts and “negotiated fixedprice” contracts under lump sum bid contracts we typically bid against other contractors based on specifications the client furnishes this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period additionally it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients which is contrary to our relationshipbased business model accordingly lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract under a negotiated fixedprice contract we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client negotiated fixedprice contracts frequently exist in singleresponsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project thus although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us however because of economies that may be realized during the contract term both negotiated fixedprice and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts over the past five years most of our fixedprice work has been either negotiated fixedprice contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services rather than turnkey construction 

guaranteed maximum price contracts 

guaranteed maximum price contracts are performed in the same manner as costreimbursable contracts however the total actual cost plus the fee cannot exceed the guaranteed price negotiated with the client if the total actual cost of the contract exceeds the guaranteed maximum price then we will bear at least some if not all of the excess in those cases where the total actual cost and fee are less than the guaranteed price we will often share the savings on a predetermined basis with the client these contracts are not our preferred form of contract because we believe they often contribute to an adversarial relationship with clients which is contrary to our relationshipbased business model

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces if we fail to maintain safe work sites we can be exposed to significant financial losses as well as civil and criminal liabilities 

construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment moving vehicles chemical and manufacturing processes and highly regulated materials on many sites we are responsible for safety and accordingly must implement safety procedures if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective our employees and others may become injured unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover increase the cost of a project to our clients and raise our operating costs any of the foregoing could result in financial losses which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials which if improperly handled or disposed of could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health safety and environmental “hse” work procedures throughout our organization including construction sites and maintenance sites the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability 

our safety record is critical to our reputation many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures as a result our failure to maintain adequate safety standards could result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

negative conditions in the credit and financial markets could impair our ability to operate our business implement our acquisition strategy and access our cash and shortterm investments 

although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations at times we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions in addition some of our clients depend of the availability of credit to help finance their capital projects due to the continuing instability of the credit markets in the us and abroad the availability of credit has continued to be relatively difficult or expensive to obtain in spite of government efforts to increase liquidity and hold or reduce interest rates this situation could negatively impact our clients’ ability to fund their projects and therefore utilize our services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us we also routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors suppliers and 

  

subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by events in the credit markets if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are therefore subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices in weak economic environments we may experience increased delays and failures due to among other reasons a diminution in our clients’ access to the credit markets if one or more clients delays in paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

furthermore our cash balances and shortterm investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america europe and asia some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance although none of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership or have been seized by their governments there is a risk that this may occur in the future if this were to occur we would be at risk of not being able to access our cash which may result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund operations 

our vulnerability to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our clients operate is exacerbated during economic downturns 

we provide technical professional and construction services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration production and refining programs for various national governments including the us federal government chemicals and polymers pharmaceuticals and biotechnology infrastructure buildings and other general industrial and consumer businesses and markets such as technology and manufacturing pulp and paper food and consumer products and mining and minerals these markets and the resulting demand for our services have been and we expect will continue to be cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control including economic conditions and changes in client spending particularly during periods of economic uncertainty 

current global economic conditions have negatively impacted our clients’ ability and willingness to fund their projects they have also caused our clients to reduce their capital expenditures alter the mix of services purchased seek more favorable price and other contract terms and otherwise slow their spending on our services for example the precipitous increase in crude oil prices followed by their collapse in calendar year 2008 caused several of our clients operating in the upstream oil and gas market to reexamine a number of their large capital projects which resulted in delays and cancellations of contracts previously awarded to us in the public sector declines in state tax revenues as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending these conditions have reduced the demand for our services which has had a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations 

current economic conditions also make it extremely difficult for our clients our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could cause businesses to continue to slow spending on our services we cannot predict the timing strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery worldwide or in our clients’ markets in addition our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and therefore may not recover as quickly as the economy at large a continuation or worsening of current weak economic conditions or a reduction in government spending could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

regardless of economic or market conditions investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost because we are dependent 

  

on the timing and funding of new awards we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients’ markets and investment decisions as a result our past results have varied considerably and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate 

fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customer’s investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation delays in existing work or changes in the timing and funding of new awards 

commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways for example for those customers that produce commodity products such as oil gas copper or fertilizers fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on their profitability and cash flow and therefore their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments to the extent our customers defer new investments or cancel or delay existing projects the demand for our services decreases which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

commodity prices can also strongly affect the costs of projects rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned as well as those in progress and result in customers deferring new investments or canceling or delaying existing projects cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel 

the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel including engineers architects designers craft personnel and corporate management professionals who have the required experience and expertise from time to time it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients in certain geographic areas for example we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel 

in addition as some of our key personnel approach retirement age we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the cost of providing our services including the extent to which we utilize our workforce affects our profitability for example the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts if an expected contract award is delayed or not received we could incur cost resulting from excess staff reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business financial conditions and results of operations 

the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the nature of our business sometimes results in clients subcontractors and vendors presenting claims to us for among other things recovery of costs related to certain projects similarly we occasionally present change orders and other claims to our clients subcontractors and vendors if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients subcontractors and vendors we could incur cost overruns reduced profits or in some cases a loss for a project additionally irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant 

  

we are a party to litigation in the normal course of business most litigation with which we are involved as a defendant relates to workers’ compensation personal injury environmental employmentlabor professional liability and similar matters we can be exposed to claims and litigation if for example there is a failure at any of the projects for which we have provided engineering or other services such claims could relate to among other things personal injury loss of life business interruption property damage pollution and environmental damage and be brought by our clients or third parties such as those who use or reside near our clients’ projects we can also be exposed to claims if we agreed that a project will achieve certain performance standards and those standards are not met in many of our contracts with clients subcontractors and vendors we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages penalties losses and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts 

we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations our insurance programs have varying coverage limits and maximums in addition we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under these programs as a result we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured our insurers are also subject to business risk and as a result one or more of them may be unable to fulfill their insurance obligations due to insolvency or otherwise 

pending or future claims against us could result in professional liability product liability criminal liability warranty obligations and other liabilities which to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties restrictions and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities and profit and cost controls government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding contracts with the us federal government for example are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for government programs may even be eliminated as a result our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues those with the us federal government represented approximately 203 of our total revenue in fiscal 2009 the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition since government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socioeconomic requirements we must comply with such requirements for example for contracts with the us federal government we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation the truth in negotiations act the cost accounting standards the service contract act and dod security regulations we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices environmental protection recordkeeping and accounting these regulations and requirements affect how we transact business with our clients and in some instances impose additional costs on our business operations government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than nongovernment contracts this includes for example unlimited indemnification obligations 

we also are subject to government audits investigations and proceedings and socalled “qui tam” actions brought by individuals or the government under the us federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws for example government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations these audits can result in adjustments to the amount of contract costs we believe are reimbursable by the agencies and the amount of our overhead costs allocated to the agencies 

  

if we violate a rule or regulation fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit a variety of penalties can be imposed including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties in addition any or all of our government contracts could be terminated we could be suspended or debarred from all government contract work or payment of our costs could be disallowed the occurrence of any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we bear the risk of cost overruns in fixedprice and guaranteed maximum price contracts we may experience reduced profits or in some cases losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates 

for fiscal 2009 approximately 15 of our revenues were earned under contracts that were either fixedprice or guaranteed maximum price in nature for these contracts we bear the risk of paying some if not all of any cost overruns under fixedprice and guaranteed maximumprice contracts contract prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions including those about future economic conditions prices and availability of labor equipment and materials and other exigencies if these estimates prove inaccurate there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications or if circumstances change due to among other things unanticipated technical problems difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals changes in local laws or labor conditions weather delays changes in the costs of raw materials or our vendors’ or subcontractors’ inability to perform then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or in some cases a loss for that project if the project is significant or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted cancelled or suspended by our clients and therefore our backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future revenues or earnings additionally even if fully performed our backlog may not be a good indicator of our future gross margins 

as of the end of fiscal 2009 our backlog totaled approximately 152 billion there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or if realized will result in profits in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation termination or suspension at the discretion of the client in addition the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts our backlog includes expected revenues for contracts that are based on estimates projects can remain in backlog for extended periods of time because of the nature of the project and the timing of the particular services required by the project the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns 

additionally the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence future profitability in some markets there is a continuing trend towards costreimbursable contracts with incentivefee arrangements typically our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs overall safety performance overall client satisfaction and other performance criteria if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards we may receive a lower or even zero incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins accordingly there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog assuming they produce the revenues currently expected will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past 

our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control 

as is common in the industry we participate in projects by entering into joint ventures partnerships and similar arrangements this situation exposes us to a number of risks including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients our partners may also be unable or unwilling to provide the 

  

required levels of financial support to the partnerships if these circumstances occur we may be required to pay financial penalties or liquidated damages provide additional services or make additional investments to ensure adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services under agreements with joint and several liabilities we could be liable for both our obligations and those of our partners these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients all of which could have a material adverse impact on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner in these cases we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture in addition these joint ventures may not be subject to the same requirements regarding internal controls and internal control over financial reporting that we follow to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts 

much of the work performed under our contracts is performed by thirdparty subcontractors we hire we also rely on thirdparty equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired if the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated especially in a lumpsum or a fixedprice contract we may suffer losses on these contracts if a subcontractor supplier or manufacturer fails to provide services supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason we may be required to source these services equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or at a higher price than anticipated which could impact contract profitability 

in the current economic environment thirdparties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party’s ability to provide materials equipment or services which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

maintaining adequate bonding capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win fixedprice contracts 

in line with industry practice we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds to our customers these bonds indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract if a bond is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond we cannot pursue that project 

historically we have had adequate bonding capacity but as is typically the case the issuance of a bond is at the surety’s sole discretion in addition because of the overall lack of worldwide bonding capacity we may find it difficult to find sureties who will provide required levels of bonding or such bonding may only be available at significant additional cost there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms our inability to obtain adequate bonding and as a result to bid on new contracts that require such bonding could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we fail to comply with federal state local or foreign governmental requirements our business may be adversely affected 

we are subject to us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business for example we are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety laws and regulations governing among 

  

other things discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost violations of regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities 

various us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants the liability under these laws is joint and several we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen cleanup obligations at these or other sites could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

when we perform our services our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions we may be subject to liability claims by employees customers and third parties as a result of such exposures in addition we may be subject to fines penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws a claim if not covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

such laws regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could for example relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and in turn could negatively impact our revenue our failure to comply with such laws or regulations whether actual or alleged could expose us to fines penalties or potential litigation liabilities including costs settlements and judgments any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments which may require us or our clients to obtain and to comply with federal state and local government permits and approvals any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial revocation or modification under various circumstances failure to obtain or comply with or the loss or modification of the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and result of operations 

our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders although we have policies and procedures to comply with us and foreign international trade laws the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and could damage our reputation and therefore our ability to do business 

employee agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts which could result in reduced revenues and profits 

misconduct fraud noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or other improper activities by one of our employees agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations regulations regarding the protection of classified information regulations prohibiting bribery and other foreign corrupt practices regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts regulations on lobbying or similar activities regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting environmental laws and any other applicable laws or regulations for example we regularly provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters if a security breach were to occur 

  

our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective and we could face unknown risks or losses our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices if we are found to be liable for fcpa violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the loss of one or a few customers could have an adverse impact on us 

a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue andor backlog in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years for example in fiscal 2009 fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 approximately 203 168 and 166 respectively of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government although we have longstanding relationships with many of our significant clients our clients may unilaterally reduce delay or cancel their contracts at any time our loss of business from a significant client could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we engage in a highly competitive business if we are unable to compete effectively we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

we face intense competition to provide technical professional and construction services to clients the extent of such competition varies by industry geographic market and project type for example with respect to our construction and operations and maintenance services clients generally award large projects to large contractors which may give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects conversely with respect to our engineering design architectural and consulting services low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller newer competitors if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both which if significant could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our larger competitors for engineering construction and maintenance services for process plants include bechtel fluor foster wheeler kbr aker kvaerner technip worleyparsons the shaw group and amec in the area of buildings our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr hok aecom and turner in the area of infrastructure our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as urs parsons brinckerhoff hntb tetra tech parsons and ws atkins in the area of national government programs our principal competitors include several of the competitors listed above as well as saic ch2m hill weston lockheed martin and computer sciences corporation 

in addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in risk factors our international operations are also exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies 

for fiscal 2009 approximately 358 of our revenues was earned from clients outside the us our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations and we expect our international operations 

  

to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues at a minimum our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects both positive and negative that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar into the us dollar in addition our international operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic political and other conditions our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties 

our business strategy involves growth through among other things the acquisition of other companies acquiring companies presents a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in addition there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us the current credit markets may make it more difficult and costly to finance acquisitions acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 

in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make we could dilute share ownership 

one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities accordingly we filed a shelf registration statement on form s4 on december 7 2007 if we issue additional equity securities pursuant to this shelf registration statement or otherwise such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders’ individual ownership percentages in the company 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly which could have a material negative effect on the price of our common stock because of a number of factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements 

in preparing our financial statements our management is required under us generally accepted accounting principles to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities areas requiring significant estimates by our management include 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

an impairment charge of goodwill could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

under accounting principles generally accepted in the us we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach rather than amortizing it over time as of october 2 2009 we had 9298 million of goodwill representing 210 of our total assets of 44 billion we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant sustained decline in a reporting unit’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business potential government actions toward our facilities and other factors 

if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their carrying value we could be required to record an impairment charge the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken for a further discussion of goodwill impairment testing please see item 7— management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 

rising inflation interest rates andor construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts in particular with respect to our fixedprice contracts 

rising inflation interest rates or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services in addition we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixedprice and may be at risk to the effects of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are guaranteed maximumprice because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from costreimbursable type contracts approximately 85 during fiscal 2009 the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor however if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixedprice and lumpsum work is more prevalent inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future therefore increases in inflation interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control 

we are a delaware corporation certain antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us in addition certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover for example 

 

  

  

  

   

these types of provisions as well as our shareholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders accordingly stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

net earnings for fiscal 2009 decreased 209 million or 50 to 3999 million as compared to 4207 million for the prior fiscal year diluted earnings per share also declined by 50 from 338 for fiscal 2008 to 321 for fiscal 2009 

our results for fiscal 2009 reflect the continuing effects of the current global recession which has caused many of our private sector clients to reexamine their capital expenditure plans resulting in the delay in the release of new projects and in certain instances cancellations the current economic conditions have also had a negative effect on many of our public sector clients as we have seen spending reductions by federal and state governments and the delay and curtailment of key infrastructure programs 

although consolidated revenues for fiscal 2009 increased by 2152 million or 2 from fiscal 2008 most of the increase occurred during the first two quarters of fiscal 2009 as the company completed a number of projects in several of the industries and markets we serve during the second half of fiscal 2009 as the global economy continued to slow revenues droppedoff significantly project delays increased and awards of new contracts slowed 

in response to the current recession the company is implementing a variety of costcontrol measures that are intended to help stabilize our earnings we have reduced personnel implemented a salary and hiring freeze and have closed a number of our smaller offices in spite of these actions the continuing and persistent economic sluggishness will most likely continue to impact our business in fiscal 2010 and may impair our ability to forecast business trends accurately 

on the other hand we are a very diversified business we provide a widerange of services to customers operating in a wide range of industries and markets accordingly we believe that as the global economy begins to recover and depending on which industries and markets start their recovery first we will be well positioned to capitalize on whatever increased capital spending occurs our cash and cash equivalents totaled 10 billion at october 2 2009 this is 4292 million higher than the comparable amount last year our debttoequity ratio was 07 at the end of fiscal 2009 and we have over 4697 million available under our various credit facilities 

our backlog totaled 152 billion at the end of fiscal 2009 

the company’s fiscal year ends on the friday closest to september 30 determined on the basis of the number of workdays and accordingly an additional week of activity is added every five to six years such as in fiscal 2009 in the past and solely for ease of reference we titled our financial statements as being “at” or “for the fiscal year ended” september 30 henceforth we will title our financial statements using the specific date on which our fiscal years end there was no material effect on our consolidated financial statements from making this change in presentation 

critical accounting policies 

in order to understand better the changes that occur to key elements of our financial condition results of operations and cash flows a reader of this management’s discussion and analysis should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states “us gaap” the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business performing longterm engineering and constructiontype contracts requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect both the entity’s results of 

  

operations and the carrying values of its assets and liabilities although our significant accounting polices are described in note 2— significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k the following discussion is intended to highlight and describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue accounting for contracts and use of joint ventures —in general we recognize revenues at the time we provide services depending on the commercial terms of the contract we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred or using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion this method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress in making such estimates judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule the cost of materials and labor productivity and the impact of change orders liability claims contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee in some of the markets we serve there is an increasing trend towards costreimbursable contracts with incentivefee arrangements in certain instances we base our incentive fees on achievement of target completion dates target costs andor other performance criteria failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or nonrecoverable costs which could exceed revenues recognized from the project 

we provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known without regard to the percentage of completion 

the nature of our business sometimes results in clients subcontractors or vendors presenting claims to us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible in those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract we include in the total estimated costs of the contract and therefore the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract an estimate based on all relevant facts and circumstances available of the additional costs to be incurred similarly and in the normal course of business we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible in those situations where we have presented such claims to our clients we include in revenues the amount of costs incurred without profit to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims 

certain costreimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment in this situation revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts in those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs that are not allowable under the terms of the contract we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly 

as is common in the industry we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures and consortiums for certain of these joint ventures ie where we have an undivided interest in the assets and liabilities of the venture we recognize our proportionate share of joint venture revenues costs and operating profit in our consolidated statements of earnings for other investments in engineering and construction joint ventures we use the equity method of accounting 

accounting for stock issued to employees and others —we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the estimated grantdate fair value of the award 

we use the blackscholes option pricing model to compute the grant date fair value of awards of equity instruments the blackscholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions in order to compute the hypothetical fair value of a stock option changes in these assumptions can cause drastically different values 

  

being assigned to a stock option the value assigned to any stock options that may be awarded in the future as well as the related expense associated with any such awards will be dependent on the assumptions used at the time of award 

accounting for pension plans —the accounting for pension plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans’ assets and liabilities these assumptions include discount rates investment returns and projected salary increases among others the actuarial assumptions used in determining the funded statuses of the plans are provided in note 7— pension plans of notes to consolidated financial statement beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

the expected rates of return on plan assets for fiscal 2009 ranged from 23 to 80 this compares to a range of 50 to 90 for fiscal 2008 we believe the range of rates we applied for fiscal 2009 reflects the longterm returns expected on the plans’ assets considering recent market conditions projected rates of inflation the diversification of the plans’ assets and the expected real rates of market returns the discount rates used to compute plan liabilities were changed from a range of 525 to 625 in fiscal 2008 to a range of 25 to 56 in fiscal 2009 these assumptions represent the company’s best estimate of the rates at which its pension obligations could be effectively settled 

changes in the actuarial assumptions often have a material affect on the values assigned to plan assets and liabilities and the associated pension expense for example if the discount rate used to value the our net pension benefit obligation “pbo” at october 2 2009 was higher lower by 025 the pbo would have been lower higher at that date by approximately 39 million and the net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2010 would have been lower higher by approximately 4 million similarly if the expected return on plan assets were increased decreased by 025 the net periodic pension cost for fiscal 2010 would decrease increase by approximately 2 million differences between actuarial assumptions and actual performance ie actuarial gains and losses that are not recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost in the period in which such differences arise are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are recognized as part of net periodic pension cost in future periods in accordance with us gaap management monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in an effort to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used 

contractual guarantees litigation investigations and insurance —in the normal course of business we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation the guarantees to which we are a party generally relate to project schedules and plant performance most of the litigation in which we are involved has us as a defendant in workers’ compensation personal injury environmental employmentlabor professional liability and other similar lawsuits we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations we have elected however to retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under our insurance programs this situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured and we intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of our contracts 

in accordance with us gaap we record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such guarantees litigation and insurance claims we include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations 

in addition as a contractor providing services to the united states federal government and several of its agencies we are subject to many levels of audits investigations and claims by or on behalf of the us federal government with respect to contract performance pricing costs cost allocations and procurement practices we adjust revenues based upon the amounts we expect to realize considering the effects of any client audits or governmental investigations 

testing goodwill for possible impairment —the goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets is tested annually for possible impairment in performing the annual impairment test we evaluate our goodwill at 

  

the reporting unit level we have determined that we have two reporting units which are based on geography we refer to these reporting units internally as “europe” and “noneurope” each of our reporting units conducts the business activities described elsewhere in this 2009 form 10k which includes providing professional technical services such as design engineering and architectural services construction andor construction management services and maintenance and operations services 

our geographybased reporting units reflect the company’s organizational structure which is based predominately on geography as well as our acquisition strategy which favors acquisition targets that among other things provide access to new geographic areas our reporting units represent rational groupings into which substantially all of our major acquisitions which are responsible for the goodwill appearing in our consolidated balance sheet have been assimilated and all of the operations under each reporting unit share in the benefits of the goodwill created by our acquisitions 

us gaap does not prescribe a specific valuation method for estimating the fair value of reporting units we determined that a market approach is an appropriate method for valuing our reporting units in light of its common use as a technique for valuing businesses in general using this method the fair value of our reporting units was estimated by multiplying their respective aftertax earnings for the trailing twelve months by the company’s overall average market earnings multiple since the activities of each reporting unit approximates that of the company overall we concluded that the use the company’s market multiple for purposes of applying the marketbased valuation approach was reasonable we also believe that the use of this multiple is appropriate considering that both reporting units have qualitative characteristics that are generally consistent with those of the parent company those characteristics include size in terms of resources ie personnel a large diverse client base broad geographic reach and a broad range of design engineering and construction and construction management capabilities 

the determination of reporting units and the selection of the valuation technique used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units requires the exercise of judgment by management the fair values resulting from the valuation technique used are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of the reporting units to willing third parties 

as mentioned above the key inputs used in the valuation model are the aftertax earnings of our reporting units and the company’s marketdriven average earnings multiple the multiples used for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 were approximately 15 31 and 26 respectively in the event either the aftertax earnings of the company’s reporting units or the company’s market earnings multiples decline significantly after the date the annual impairment test is performed the company will reperform the test at a date closer to fiscal yearend 

based on the results of the abovedescribed tests there were no indications of impairment of the goodwill shown in our consolidated balance sheets for fiscal years 2009 and 2008 

changes in the inputs used in our valuation model ie declines in the company’s average earnings multiple or the aftertax earnings of our reporting units could result in an indication of possible impairment of goodwill in the future 

results of operations 

general 

our business focuses exclusively on providing technical professional and construction services to a large number of industrial commercial and governmental clients around the world the services we provide generally fall into four broad categories 

 

  

   

  

 the scope of services we can provide our clients therefore ranges from consulting and conceptual design services which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project to complete singleresponsibility designbuildoperate contracts 

the following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each of the last three fiscal years in thousands 

 

 we focus our services on clients operating in certain industry groups and markets we believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit crossutilization of our resources the following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each of the last three fiscal years in thousands 

 

  

 fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

we recorded net earnings of 3999 million or 321 per diluted share for the fiscal year ended october 2 2009 compared to net earnings of 4207 million or 338 per diluted share for fiscal 2008 

  

although consolidated revenues for fiscal 2009 increased by 2152 million or 20 from fiscal 2008 most of the increase occurred during the first two quarters of fiscal 2009 as the company completed a number of projects for clients operating in several of the industries and markets we serve during the second half of fiscal 2009 as the global economy continued to slow revenues droppedoff significantly while project delays increased and awards of new contracts also slowed 

revenues during fiscal 2009 from projects for clients operating in the energy  refining downstream and the oil  gas upstream industries increased a total of 1525 million or 32 from last year all of the increase related to projects for clients operating in the energy  refinery sector and reflects the rampingup of work performed at a large us oil refinery this increase was offset in part by the windingdown of work on certain projects in the upstream sector of the petroleum market that were awarded to the company in prior years when oil prices were at historically high levels 

revenues during fiscal 2009 from projects for our national government clients increased by 4484 million or 227 from last year most of the increase continues to relate to revenues from the us federal government on projects for research and development test engineering scientific and other technical services although the company performed services during fiscal 2009 for projects that were funded in part under the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 “arra” such revenues were not significant 

revenues during fiscal 2009 from projects for clients operating in the chemicals and polymers industries and the pharmaceuticals and biotechnology industries as well as the buildings market all declined as compared to last year as clients reviewed their capital expenditure plans in light of the global recession and delayed the release of new projects 

direct costs of contracts for fiscal 2009 increased 3888 million or 41 to 99 billion compared to 95 billion for fiscal 2008 the level of direct costs of contracts may fluctuate between reporting periods due to a variety of factors including the amount of passthrough cost we incur during a period on those projects where we are responsible for subcontract labor or thirdparty materials and equipment we reflect the amounts of such items in both revenues and costs and we refer to such costs as “passthrough costs” on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not considered passthrough costs and are therefore not reflected in either revenues or costs to the extent that we incur a significant amount of passthrough costs in a period our direct cost of contracts are likely to increase as well 

passthrough costs for fiscal 2009 increased 4996 million or 142 to 40 billion compared to 35 billion for fiscal 2008 in general passthrough costs are more significant on projects that have a higher content of field services activities field services revenues for fiscal 2009 increased 5754 million or 107 to 59 billion compared to 54 billion for fiscal 2008 passthrough costs are generally incurred at a specific point in the lifecycle of a project and are highly dependent on the needs of our individual clients and the nature of the clients’ projects however because we have hundreds of projects which start at various times within a fiscal year the effect of passthrough costs on the level of direct costs of contracts can vary between fiscal years without there being a fundamental or significant change to the underlying business 

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts were 864 for fiscal 2009 compared to 846 for fiscal 2008 the relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided generally speaking the more procurement we do on behalf of our clients ie where we purchase equipment and materials for use on projects andor procure subcontracts in connection with projects and the more field services revenues we have relative to technical professional services revenues the higher the ratio will be of direct costs of contracts to revenues because revenues from passthrough costs typically have lower margin rates associated with them it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in such revenues without experiencing a corresponding 

  

increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit the increase in the ratio of direct costs of contracts to revenues in fiscal 2009 as compared to last year was due primarily to higher levels of passthrough costs combined with a slight decrease in the margin rates earned on our technical professional services revenues 

sga expenses for fiscal 2009 decreased by 1511 million or 138 to 9403 million compared to 11 billion for fiscal 2008 our sga expenses typically fluctuate as a result of changes in head count and the spending required to support our technical professional services revenues which normally require additional overhead costs therefore when our technical professional services revenues increase or decrease we typically see a corresponding change in sga expenses the decrease in sga expenses was due primarily to the decline in our project services revenues combined with management’s efforts to reduce sga expenses 

operating profit for fiscal 2009 decreased by 225 million or 35 to 6206 million compared to 6431 million for fiscal 2008 as a percentage of revenues operating profit was 54 for fiscal 2009 compared to 57 in fiscal 2008 this decrease in operating profit is due primarily to the overall decline in business volume and in particular the decrease in project services revenues 

interest income for fiscal 2009 decreased by 23 million or 149 to 131 million compared to 154 million for fiscal 2008 even though the company maintained higher average cash balances during fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 the rate of interest earned on our deposits and investments was significantly lower in 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 

interest expense for fiscal 2009 decreased by 15 million or 339 to 29 million compared to 44 million for fiscal 2008 the decrease in interest expense was due primarily to lower average borrowings outstanding during fiscal 2009 as compared to last year 

miscellaneous expense net for fiscal 2009 totaled 60 million as compared to miscellaneous income net of 33 million for fiscal 2008 included in miscellaneous income net last year was a 106 million gain from the sale of the company’s interest in a business that provides specialized operations and maintenance services for highways and associated facilities by excluding the gain from fiscal 2008 miscellaneous expense net for fiscal 2008 would have been 73 million 

we recorded income tax expense of 2249 million during fiscal 2009 compared to 2367 million during fiscal 2008 our overall effective tax rate in fiscal 2009 was 36—the same as fiscal 2008 in the normal course of our business we may engage in numerous transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in income or deducted as an expense is uncertain additionally we file income franchise gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service most states in the united states and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the united states we continually monitor the appropriateness of the rate and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will change 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

we recorded net earnings of 4207 million or 338 per diluted share for the fiscal year ended september 26 2008 compared to net earnings of 2871 million or 235 per diluted share for fiscal 2007 total revenues for fiscal 2008 increased by 28 billion or 328 to 113 billion compared to total revenues of 85 billion for fiscal 2007 

revenues increased among all of the industry groups and markets we served from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 we saw particularly robust business activity by clients in both the upstream and downstream sectors of the oil and gas industry capital spending by clients operating in the upstream markets continued to be positively influenced during fiscal 2008 by higher crude prices 

  

we also saw significant revenue growth in fiscal 2008 from projects for clients operating in the energy and refining sector of the petroleum market most of this growth related to refinery expansion projects 

revenues from projects for our national government clients increased by 4762 million or 317 from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 most of the increase was attributable to revenues from the us federal government on projects for research and development test engineering scientific and other technical services revenues during fiscal 2008 from environmental engineering and remediation projects was relatively flat with fiscal 2007 

revenues from projects performed for our buildings and infrastructure clients increased by a combined 5249 million or 469 from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 part of the increase in infrastructure and buildings work was due to the acquisition of carter  burgess inc “carter  burgess” in november 2007 these markets also benefited from an increase in capital spending by various clients to improve and develop their transportation infrastructure and for projects relating to hospitals medical and research facilities and other technical buildings and facilities 

revenues from projects for our clients in the chemicals and polymers industries increased by 1715 million or 139 from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 the increase was due primarily to continuing high demand to increase production capacity 

direct costs of contracts for fiscal 2008 increased 23 billion or 311 to 95 billion compared to 73 billion for fiscal 2007 passthrough costs for fiscal 2008 increased 7707 million or 281 to 35 billion compared to 27 billion for fiscal 2007 as discussed above passthrough costs are more significant on projects that have a higher content of field services activities field services revenues for fiscal 2008 increased 13 billion or 311 to 54 billion compared to 40 billion for fiscal 2007 

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts were 846 for fiscal 2008 compared to 857 for fiscal the decrease in the ratio of direct costs of contracts to revenues in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was due primarily to a slight increase in the margin rates earned on our technical professional services revenues 

sga expenses for fiscal 2008 increased by 3220 million or 419 to 11 billion compared to 7694 million for fiscal 2007 the increase in sga expenses was partially due to the business growth we experienced in fiscal 2008 particularly in support of the 333 increase in technical professional services area of our business also contributing to the increase in sga expenses was the acquisition of carter  burgess in november 2007 

it was not practicable to isolate the increases in direct costs of contracts and sga expenses relating to that acquisition as it has been largely integrated into our other operations 

operating profit for fiscal 2008 increased by 2011 million or 455 to 6431 million compared to 4420 million for fiscal 2007 as a percentage of revenues operating profit was 57 for fiscal 2008 compared to 52 in fiscal 2007 although the company improved the margins earned on technical professional services during fiscal 2008 relative to the preceding year the increase was offset by the higher level of sga expenses acquired with carter  burgess 

interest income for fiscal 2008 decreased by 43 million or 218 to 154 million compared to 198 million for fiscal 2007 the decrease in interest income was due primarily to a lower rate of interest earned on our deposits during fiscal 2008 as compared to the preceding year 

interest expense for fiscal 2008 decreased by 36 million or 450 to 44 million compared to 80 million for fiscal 2007 the decrease in interest expense was due primarily to lower average borrowings outstanding during fiscal 2008 as compared to the preceding year 

  

miscellaneous income net for fiscal 2008 increased 84 million to 33 million as compared to last year included in this amount is a 106 million gain from the sale recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 of the company’s interest in a business that provides specialized operations and maintenance services for highways and associated facilities 

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth certain information about our contractual obligations as of october 2 2009 in thousands 

 

  

    backlog 

backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us with respect to operations and maintenance “om” contracts however we include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for only one succeeding year regardless of the remaining life of the contract for national government programs other than us federal om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded excluding option periods 

the following table summarizes our backlog for each of the last three fiscal years in millions 

 

 because the entire value of a contract is added to backlog as soon as the contract is awarded to us rather than adding the contracts to backlog gradually over time and because many of our contracts require us to 

  

provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years we evaluate our backlog on a yearoveryear basis rather than on a sequential quarteroverquarter basis our backlog at october 2 2009 decreased by 15 billion or 88 to 152 billion from 167 billion at september 26 2008 

in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client during fiscal 2009 approximately 19 billion was removed from backlog as a result of project cancellations approximately 24 billion was removed from backlog during fiscal 2008 relating to cancelled projects in a situation where a client terminates a contract we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and in certain instances we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs 

while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein accordingly backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenues 

backlog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies totaled approximately 42 billion or 277 of total backlog 34 billion or 204 of total backlog and 22 billion or 165 of total backlog at october 2 2009 september 26 2008 and september 28 2007 respectively most of our us federal contracts require that services be provided beyond one year in general these contract must be funded annually ie the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the us congress to the procuring agency and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts 

subject to the factors discussed in item 1a— risk factors  above we estimate that approximately 80 billion or 524 of total backlog at october 2 2009 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year 

effects of inflation 

the effects of inflation on our business is discussed in detail in item 1a— risk factors  and is incorporated herein by reference 

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our operations primarily through cash provided by operations at october 2 2009 our principal source of liquidity consisted of 10 billion of cash and cash equivalents and 2893 million of available capacity under our 2900 million unsecured revolving credit facility discussed below 

during fiscal 2009 our cash and cash equivalents increased by 4292 million to 10 billion this compares to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 89 million during fiscal 2008 and an increase of 1793 million during fiscal 2007 during fiscal 2009 we generated net cash inflows of 5335 million from operating activities and 296 million from the effect of exchange rate changes these inflows were offset in part by outflows from investing activities and financing activities of 949 million and 390 million respectively 

our operations provided net cash of 5335 million during fiscal 2009 this compares to net cash inflows of 3134 million and 3609 million during fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively the 2201 million increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 was due primarily to the following factors 

 

  

   

  

  

  

 these increases in cash flows from operations were offset in part by a 209 million decrease in net earnings 

with respect to the 1737 million increase in cash flows relating to changes in our working capital accounts there was no unusual activity occurring in these accounts during fiscal 2009 because such a high percentage of our revenues are earned on costplus type contracts 85 and 86 of total revenues for fiscal years 2009 and 2008 respectively and due to the significance of revenues relating to passthrough costs most of the costs we incur are included in invoices we send to clients although we continually monitor our accounts receivable we manage the operating cash flows of the company by managing the working capital accounts in total rather than by the individual elements the primary elements of the company’s working capital accounts are accounts receivable accounts payable and billings in excess of cost accounts payable consists of obligations to third parties relating primarily to costs incurred for projects which are generally billable to clients accounts receivable consist of billings to our clients—a substantial portion of which is for projectrelated costs billings in excess of cost consist of billings to and payments from our clients for costs yet to be incurred 

this relationship between revenues and costs and between receivables and payables is unique for our industry and facilitates reviews of cash flow information at the total working capital level the 1695 million increase in cash flows relating to changes in our working capital accounts was due primarily to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts it is indicative of the general softening of the business and reflects the situation where existing receivables are being collected at a faster pace than new receivables are being generated and where project costs are being incurred at a slower rate than the prior year 

we used 949 million of cash and cash equivalents for investing activities during fiscal 2009 this compares to net cash outflows of 4099 million and 1658 million during fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively the 3150 million decrease in cash used for investing activities as compared to fiscal 2009 was due primarily to decreases in cash used to acquire businesses and to purchase property and equipment offset in part by an increase in cash used for investments 

we used 223 million of cash in fiscal 2009 to acquire a small construction and maintenance contractor located in north america this compares to 2641 million of cash used to acquire various domestic and international businesses last fiscal year 

additions to property and equipment net of disposals used 533 million of cash in fiscal 2009 or 611 million less than the amount used last fiscal year included in the fiscal 2009 additions were major capital improvements made to our modular construction facility in charleston north carolina and the development and deployment of our global human resources information application 

we used 323 million of cash to purchase a onethird share in awe management limited “awe” from british nuclear group limited awe is a joint venture between the company lockheed martin and serco group plc to manage the atomic weapons establishment on behalf of the uk ministry of defence 

we used 390 million of cash and cash equivalents for financing activities during fiscal 2009 this compares to net cash inflows of 988 million during fiscal 2008 and net cash outflows of 203 million during fiscal 2007 the 1378 million net decrease in cash flows from financing activities during fiscal 2009 as 

  

compared to fiscal 2008 was due primarily to a 506 million change in other deferred liabilities relating primarily to contributions to the company’s defined benefit pension plans a 457 million decrease in cash flows attributable to issuances of common stock including the related excess tax benefits and the company’s borrowing activities during fiscal 2008 the company was a net borrower under all of its long and shortterm credit facilities combined in the amount of 114 million in contrast during fiscal 2009 the company used a net 300 million of cash to paydown bank debt 

we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future we had 10 billion in cash and cash equivalents at october 2 2009 compared to 6044 million at september 26 2008 our consolidated working capital position at october 2 2009 was 15 billion compared to 12 billion at september 26 2008 we have approximately 4697 million available under our various credit facilities including 2900 million under our longterm unsecured revolving credit facility under which only 07 million was utilized at october 2 2009 in the form of direct borrowings we believe that the capacity terms and conditions of our longterm revolving credit facility is adequate for our working capital and general business requirements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are party to financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk in the form of guarantees not reflected in our balance sheet that arise in the normal course of business however such offbalance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or resources that is material to investors see note 10— commitments and contingencies and derivative financial instruments of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

new accounting pronouncements 

in june 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 168— the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles—a replacement of fasb statement no 162 “sfas 168” on the effective date of sfas 168 the fasb accounting standards codification “asc” became the source of authoritative accounting and reporting standards in the us for nongovernmental entities after the effective date of sfas 168 changes to us gaap will be made through accounting standards updates “asu” issued by the fasb sfas 168 was effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september 15 2009 the application of sfas 168 did not have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements

depending on the size and nature of an acquisition the adoption of asc 805 and asc 8101065 could have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk in the normal course of business our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

our only committed source for longterm credit is a 2900 million syndicated revolving credit facility the total amount outstanding under this facility at october 2 2009 was 07 million this agreement expires in may 2012 and provides for both fixedrate and variablerate borrowings our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we continuously monitor changes in interest rates and use cash provided from operations to repay our borrowings as quickly as possible furthermore the company can use a combination of both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk 

  

foreign currency risk 

in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency we attempt to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs in those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies we follow the provisions of asc 81510 in accounting for our derivative contracts the company does not currently have exchange rate sensitive instruments that would have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

the company’s management with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined by rule 13a15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of october 2 2009 the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k the “evaluation date” based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the evaluation date 

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act management with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the evaluation date based on the framework established in “ internal control—integrated framework”  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management has concluded that the internal controls of the company over its financial reporting as of the evaluation date were effective the company’s independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting which appears later in this annual report on form 10k 

changes in internal control 

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the company’s quarter ended october 2 2009 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

limitations on effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its system of internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed or operated can provide 

  

only reasonable but not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of internal control are met the design of the company’s control system reflects the fact that there are resource constraints and that the benefits of such control system must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control failures and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the intentional acts of individuals by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that the design of any particular control will always succeed in achieving its objective under all potential future conditions

general 

there are four major components of our business strategy safety a relationshipbased approach to client interactions a strong focus on cost control and an organizational structure that facilitates efficient project management and execution acquisitions play an important role in our business strategy as they allow us to expand on existing client relationships as well as develop new ones acquisitions also allow us the opportunity to leverage our cost structure across geographic areas 

safety 

key to the success of our business strategy is our uncompromising focus on safety providing an injury and incident free work environment is an unequivocal condition of the relationship we have with our employees and subcontractors it is also a paramount issue in our dealings with our clients and our safety program is a fundamental element of our overall approach to risk management a safe work environment is critical to our longterm success and growth we maintain a centralized quality and safety group to help ensure that the services we provide are delivered safely and in accordance with standard work processes unsafe job sites and office environments increase employee turnover increase the cost of a project to our clients expose us to types and levels of risk that are fundamentally unacceptable and increase our own operating costs as well safe job sites and office environments on the other hand benefit our clients promote employee morale and enhance the longterm relationships we have with our clients employees and business partners 

relationshipbased business model 

our relationshipbased business model is central to our sustained growth and profitability we aggressively pursue the development of longterm affiliations and alliances with our clients by working as a partner with our clients on their capital programs we increase our understanding of their overall business needs as well as the unique technical requirements of their projects this increased understanding gives us the opportunity to provide a superior value to our clients we market all of our services to clients in connection with their projects where the scope of work required is within our expertise by integrating and bundling our services ie providing design engineering and construction services on the same project we can price contracts more competitively and enhance overall profitability while delivering additional value to our clients our relationshipbased business model also helps us more fully understand the risks inherent in the projects which in turn allows us to better manage those risks our approach also provides us with opportunities to market those services our clients will need in the post startup and commissioning phases of a plant such as operations and maintenance services this model however does not preclude us from undertaking discrete projects that do not conflict with our business strategy we will accept and perform discrete projects for our clients if we can negotiate acceptable pricing and other contract terms and conditions 

closely linked to our relationshipbased business model is our multidomestic geographic strategy for conducting business around the world this strategy requires us to act and operate as a local contractor in every geographic area of the world in which we do business we believe it is important for us as a company to “be local” with respect to our network of offices and operations because our offices can generally sustain themselves with a base load of local work we’re able to support our multinational clients with their crossborder capital projects our core clients can depend on us for assistance with their engineering and construction needs when they move projects around the world our multidomestic strategy also allows us to be competitive around the world to the extent we win large projects and are able to perform meaningful portions of the project utilizing local resources rather than exporting the work to other offices within the group 

  

cost control 

our continual emphasis on cost control is an important component of our business strategy as the global economy expands and companies providing technical professional and construction services are required to compete against each other across geographic boundaries the company that can provide its clients with cost efficient solutions to their project needs has the advantage our attention to cost control throughout every level of our organization allows us to deliver superior technical professional and construction services safely efficiently and within the cost and time parameters our clients require 

organizational structure 

our organizational structure and integrated system for delivering services is another key component of our business strategy our operating units generally use a matrix organizational structure whereby our project management functions are supported by the various technical engineering design and construction disciplines that are necessary to effectively execute longterm engineering and construction contracts crucial functions such as project controls and procurement are local to each of our major offices and serve operations by providing specialized services required by projects in addition we actively employ a boundaryless approach to the way we serve our clients we do not maintain “profit centers” within the company nor do our operating groups compete against each other for contracts instead our organizational structure encourages our operating groups to work cohesively while simultaneously helping to reduce costs and promote an efficient delivery system for all of our services 

the role of acquisitions in our business strategy 

our relationshipbased business model is a significant driver of our acquisition strategy when we review potential acquisition targets we are conscious of the effect the acquisition may have on our client base we favor acquisitions that allow us to expand or enhance the range of services we provide existing clients andor gain access to new geographic areas in which our clients either already operate or plan to expand by expanding into new geographic areas and adding to our existing technical and project management capabilities we strive to position ourselves as a preferred singlesource provider of technical professional and construction services to our major clients the following is a brief description of some of our key acquisitions over the past five years 

 

  

  

  

   

 in any particular year we will also make smaller acquisitions as opportunities arise 

services provided 

as described above the services we provide generally fall into the following four broad categories project services process scientific and systems consulting services construction services and operations and maintenance services the scope of services we can provide our clients therefore range from consulting and conceptual design services which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project to complete singleresponsibility designbuildoperate contracts 

the following table sets forth our revenues from each of our four service categories for each of the last five fiscal years ended september 30 in thousands of dollars 

 

 project services 

we employ all of the engineering design architectural and related disciplines necessary to design and engineer modern process plants including projects for clients in the chemicals and polymers pharmaceuticals and biotechnology oil  gas refining food and consumer products and basic resources industries buildings including facilities for clients in the health care education and criminal justice markets as well as other buildings for clients in the private sector infrastructure projects including highways roads bridges and other transportation systems water and wastewater treatment plants water resources facilities and other similar plants and facilities technology and manufacturing facilities for clients in the aerospace automotive defense semiconductor and electronics industries consumer products manufacturing facilities pulp and paper plants and other facilities we also employ many of the requisite scientific technical and program management capabilities necessary to provide program integration testing and evaluation services for clients in the defense and aerospace industries for the us department of defense dod in support of information systems for weapons acquisition centers for the national aeronautics and space administration nasa for aerospace testing and propulsion systems and facilities and for various agencies of the us federal government in support of environmental programs 

we are capable of providing our clients with a variety of value engineering services including “safety in design” through safety in design we integrate best practices hazard analysis and risk assessment methods early in the design phase of projects taking those steps necessary to eliminate or mitigate injury and damage during the construction startup testing and commissioning and operations phases of a project 

in the area of construction management we provide our clients with a wide range of services as an agent for our clients we may act as the program director whereby we oversee on the owner’s behalf the complete planning design and construction phases of the project alternatively our services may be limited to providing construction consulting 

  

also included in the category of project services are certain related services such as planning scheduling procurement estimating cost engineering project accounting and quality and safety necessary to support our engineering design construction construction and program management operations and maintenance and consulting services 

process scientific and systems consulting 

we employ all of the professional and technical expertise necessary to provide a broad range of consulting services including performing pricing studies market analyses and financial projections necessary in determining the feasibility of a project performing gasoline reformulation modeling analyzing and evaluating layout and mechanical designs for complex processing plants analyzing automation and control systems analyzing designing and executing biocontainment strategies developing and performing process protocols with respect to the us food and drug administrationmandated qualification and validation requirements providing consultation on proposed railway and airport expansion projects and performing geological and metallurgical studies 

also included in this service category are the revenues relating to professional and program management services required to assist clients such as the us federal government and its agencies in a wide range of defense and aerospace related programs such services typically are more technical and scientific in nature than other project services we provide and may involve such tasks as supporting the development and testing of conventional weapons systems weapons modeling and simulations computer systems development maintenance and support evaluation and testing of missioncritical control systems and other highly technical programs and tasks 

construction 

we provide traditional field construction services to private and public sector clients in virtually all of the industry groups and markets to which we provide project services in the area of environmental remediation and restoration we provide environmental remedial construction services for a variety of public and private sector clients we also provide many of our clients with modular construction technology our modular construction technology is an advanced form of engineering and design offsite fabrication and assembly and field erection it provides our clients with an alternative approach to traditional methods of engineering and construction which can compress and shorten the construction schedule reduce risk and lower costs 

historically our field construction activities were focused primarily on those construction projects for which we perform much of the related engineering and design work by focusing our construction efforts on such projects we minimize the risks associated with constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared by third parties the financial risk to us of constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared by third parties may be particularly significant on fixedprice contracts therefore we generally avoid this type of project however we will pursue constructiononly projects when we can negotiate pricing and other contract terms we deem acceptable and which results in a fair return for the degree of risk we assume 

operations and maintenance om 

om generally refers to all of the tasks required to operate and maintain large complex facilities on behalf of clients we can provide key management and support services over all aspects of the operations of a facility including managing subcontractors and other onsite personnel within the environmental area om often includes engineering and technical support services as well as program management services necessary to remediate contaminated sites within the aerospace and defense areas om often requires us to provide the management and technical support services necessary to operate and maintain engine test facilities weapons integration and hightech simulation and verification centers such om contracts also frequently require us to provide facilities management and maintenance services utilities operations and maintenance services property management and disposition services and construction support services 

  

om also includes process plant maintenance services which generally involves all of the tasks required to keep a process plant typically a refinery or chemical plant in daytoday operation such tasks could include the repair and replacement of pumps piping heat exchangers and other equipment as well as “turnaround” work which involves major refurbishment that can only be performed when the plant is shut down since shutdowns are expensive to the owners of the plant turnaround work often requires maximizing the number of skilled craft personnel who can work efficiently on a project on a 24hoursperday sevendaysperweek basis we use sophisticated computer scheduling and programming to complete turnaround projects quickly and we maintain contact with a large pool of skilled craft personnel we can hire as needed on maintenance and turnaround projects 

although the gross profit margins that we realize from om services are generally lower than those associated with the other services we provide the costs to support maintenance activities are also generally lower furthermore we view om contracts as presenting a lower financial risk to us as compared to some of the other services we provide because om contracts are normally costreimbursable in nature additionally although engineering and construction projects may be of a shortterm nature om services often result in longterm relationships with clients for example we have been providing maintenance services at several major process plants within the us for several decades this aspect of maintenance services greatly reduces the selling costs in respect of such services 

financial information about segments 

although we describe our business in this annual report on form 10k in terms of the services we provide the markets in which our clients operate and the geographic areas in which we operate we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment pursuant to the us financial accounting standards board’s statement of financial accounting standards no 131— disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  in making this determination we considered various economic characteristics of our operations including the nature of the services we provide our internal processes for delivering those services and the types of customers we have in addition to the discussion that follows please refer to note 14— segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

there is a high degree of similarity of the workforces among our service categories for example engineering and design services ie services provided by persons who are degreed and in certain circumstances licensed such as engineers architects scientists and economists exist in all four service categories in addition there is a high degree of similarity among a significant component of the workforces we employ to perform construction and om projects in providing construction and om services we employ a large number of skilled craft labor personnel these may include welders pipe fitters electricians crane operators and other personnel who work on very large capital projects in the case of projects classified within the construction services category or on smaller capital projects in the case of maintenance projects classified within the om services category 

our operating units use a matrix organizational structure our results therefore are dependent on groups representing technical disciplines eg electrical engineering mechanical engineering cost engineering etc supporting project management personnel who maintain the relationship between us and our clients and who are ultimately responsible for delivering projects to our clients safely on time and on budget additionally all of our operating regions and divisions use common tools policies and procedures to manage and run their respective units these include project review meetings project performance evaluations and project execution plans 

the use of technology throughout our organization is highly uniform whether it is pcbased computer aided design and drafting cadd applications used by our engineering and design staff or pcbased modeling programs used by the scientific and consulting staff or pcbased scheduling estimating and cost control applications used by homeoffice personnel in support of our construction and maintenance activities all of the service categories described above are equally affected by changes in technology as they occur in the economy at large 

  

furthermore the types of information and internal reports used by management to monitor performance evaluate results of operations allocate resources and otherwise manage the business support a single reportable segment accordingly based on these similarities we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment for purposes of the disclosure included in this annual report on form 10k 

industry groups and markets 

we provide our services to clients that operate in the following industry groups and markets energy and refining—downstream longterm programs for various national governments including the us chemicals and polymers oil and gas—upstream pharmaceuticals and biotechnology infrastructure buildings and other general industrial and consumer businesses and markets such as technology and manufacturing pulp and paper food and consumer products and mining and minerals we believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit crossutilization of our resources which helps to mitigate the negative effects of a downturn in a single industry

contracts 

while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake our contracts generally fall into three broad categories costreimbursable fixedprice and guaranteed maximum price the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the last five fiscal years ended september 30 

 

 in accordance with industry practice most of our contracts including those with the us federal government are subject to termination at the discretion of the client in such situations our contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination 

when we are directly responsible for engineering design procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client’s plant or facility we reflect the costs of materials equipment and subcontracts in both revenues and costs on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs the following table sets forth the approximate amount of such passthrough costs included in revenues for each of the last five fiscal years ended september 30 in thousands of dollars 

 

 costreimbursable contracts 

costreimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit the profit element may be in the form of a simple markup applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee or a combination of a markup and a fee the fee element can also take several forms the fee may be a fixed amount as specified in the contract it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred or it may be an incentive fee based on targets milestones or performance factors defined in the contract in general we prefer costreimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price 

fixedprice contracts 

fixedprice contracts include both “lump sum bid” contracts and “negotiated fixedprice” contracts under lump sum bid contracts we are required to bid against other contractors based on specifications the client furnishes this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period additionally it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients which is contrary to our relationshipbased business model accordingly lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract under a negotiated fixedprice contract we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client negotiated fixedprice contracts frequently exist in singleresponsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project thus although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us however because of economies that may be realized during the contract term both negotiated fixedprice and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts over the past five years most of our fixedprice work has been either negotiated fixedprice contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services rather than turnkey construction 

  

guaranteed maximum price contracts 

guaranteed maximum price contracts are performed in the same manner as costreimbursable contracts however the total actual cost plus the fee cannot exceed the guaranteed price negotiated with the client if the total actual cost of the contract exceeds the guaranteed maximum price then we will bear at least some if not all of the excess in those cases where the total actual cost and fee are less than the guaranteed price we will often share the savings on a predetermined basis with the client these contracts are not our preferred form of contract because they often contribute to an adversarial relationship with clients which is contrary to our relationshipbased business model

 item 1a risk factors tableend construction and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces if we fail to maintain safe work sites we can be exposed to significant financial losses as well as civil and criminal liabilities 

construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment moving vehicles chemical and manufacturing processes and highly regulated materials on many sites we are responsible for safety and accordingly must implement safety procedures if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective our employees and others may become injured this could result in financial losses which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials which if improperly handled or disposed of could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health safety and environmental hse work procedures throughout our organization including construction sites and maintenance sites the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability 

our safety record is critical to our reputation many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid for contracts and many contracts provide for automatic termination or forfeiture of some or all of our contract fees or profit in the event we fail to meet certain measures as a result our failure to maintain adequate safety standards could result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

negative conditions in the credit markets could impair our ability to operate our business and implement our acquisition strategy 

although we finance much of our operations using cash provided by operations we depend on the availability of credit to grow our business and to help fund business acquisitions in addition from time to time our clients depend of the availability of credit to help finance their capital projects due to the continuing instability of the credit markets in the us and abroad the availability of credit has continued to tighten in spite of government efforts to increase liquidity and hold or reduce interest rates in addition we are subject to the risk that the counterparties to our credit agreements may go bankrupt if they suffer catastrophic demand on their liquidity that will prevent them from fulfilling their contractual obligations to us this situation may inhibit our growth and could negatively impact our clients’ ability to fund their projects resulting in our loss of revenues 

we routinely enter into contracts with counterparties including vendors suppliers and subcontractors that may be negatively impacted by recent events in the credit markets if those counterparties are unable to perform their obligations to us or our clients we may be required to provide additional services or make alternate arrangements with other parties to ensure adequate performance and delivery of services to our clients these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients which could impact our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we typically bill our clients for our services in arrears and are therefore subject to our clients delaying or failing to pay our invoices in weak economic environments we may experience increased delays and failures due to among other reasons a diminution in our clients’ access to the credit markets if one or more clients delays in paying or fail to pay us a significant amount of our outstanding receivables it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity results of operations and financial condition additional discussion of some of the risks associated with the current economic downturn can be found in item 7— management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  below 

our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel 

the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain personnel including engineers architects designers craft personnel and corporate management professionals who have the required experience and expertise there is intense demand for these employees in certain geographic areas for example we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified craft personnel in addition as some of our key personnel approach retirement age we also need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the nature of our business sometimes results in clients subcontractors and vendors presenting claims to us for among other things recovery of costs related to certain projects similarly we occasionally present change orders and other claims to our clients subcontractors and vendors if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients subcontractors and vendors we could incur cost overruns and reduced profits additionally irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and change orders the cost to prosecute and defend claims and change orders can be significant in many of our contracts with clients subcontractors and vendors we agree to retain or assume potential liabilities for damages penalties losses and other exposures relating to projects that could result in claims that greatly exceed the anticipated profits relating to those contracts and that could if significant enough have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we are also subject to claims for not fulfilling guarantees relating to among other things project schedules and plant performance 

  

in addition we become a party to litigation in the normal course of business most litigation with which we are involved as a defendant relates to workers’ compensation personal injury environmental employmentlabor professional liability and similar matters such lawsuits may relate to current or completed projects and may be brought by our clients as well as those who use or reside near our clients’ projects if a lawsuit is determined contrary to our interests it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations our insurance programs have varying coverage limits and maximums in addition we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under these programs as a result we may be subject to future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured our insurers are subject to business risk one or more of our insurers may be unable to fulfill their insurance obligations due to insolvency or otherwise to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted which impact could be material 

our business is vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our clients operate and dependent on the timing and funding of new awards 

we provide technical professional and construction services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration production and refining programs for various national governments including the us federal government chemicals and polymers pharmaceuticals and biotechnology infrastructure buildings and other general industrial and consumer businesses and markets such as technology and manufacturing pulp and paper food and consumer products and mining and minerals these markets and the resulting demand for our services have been and we expect will continue to be cyclical and subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors beyond our control including economic conditions and changes in client spending 

during economic slowdowns many of our clients may face considerable budget shortfalls or may delay capital spending which may decrease the overall demand for our services for example a decrease in state tax revenue as well as other economic declines may result in lower state and local government spending our clients may also find it more difficult to raise capital in the future due to substantial limitations on the availability of credit and other uncertainties in the municipal and general credit markets in addition our clients may also demand better pricing terms and their ability to pay our invoices in a timely manner may be affected by an increasingly weakened economy our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy and therefore may not recover as quickly as the economy at large if the economy weakens further or government spending is reduced then our revenues net income and overall financial condition may deteriorate 

regardless of economic or market conditions investment decisions by our customers may vary by location or as a result of other factors like the availability of labor or relative construction cost because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards we are therefore vulnerable to changes in our clients’ markets and investment decisions as a result our past results have varied considerably and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the markets and the locations in which we operate 

fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our customer’s investment decisions and therefore subject us to risks of cancellation delays in existing work or changes in the timing and funding of new awards 

commodity prices can affect our customers in a number of ways some of our customers produce commodity products such as fertilizers oil and gas or copper fluctuations in price can have a direct effect on our customers’ profitability and cash flow and therefore their willingness to continue to invest or make new capital investments commodity prices also strongly affect the costs of projects rising commodity prices can negatively impact the potential returns on investments that are planned as well as those in progress as a result of either or both of these factors our customers may defer new investment or cancel or delay existing projects cancellations and delays have affected our past results and may continue to do so in significant and unpredictable ways 

  

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties restrictions and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities and profit and cost controls government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with funding contracts with the us federal government for example are subject to the uncertainties of congressional funding governments are typically under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for government programs may even be eliminated as a result our government clients may terminate our contracts for convenience or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice since government contracts represent a significant percentage of our revenues those with the us federal government represented approximately 168 of our total revenue in fiscal 2008 the loss of such contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socioeconomic requirements for example for contracts with the us federal government we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation the truth in negotiations act the cost accounting standards the service contract act and dod security regulations we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices environmental protection recordkeeping and accounting government contracts also contain terms that expose us to heightened levels of risk and potential liability than nongovernment contracts this includes for example unlimited indemnification obligations 

we also are subject to government audits investigations and proceedings and socalled “qui tam” actions brought by individuals or the government under the us federal false claims act or under similar state and local laws for example government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether allowable costs are in accordance with applicable regulations 

if we violate a rule or regulation fail to comply with a contractual or other requirement or do not satisfy an audit a variety of penalties can be imposed including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties in addition our government contracts could be terminated we could be suspended or debarred from government contract work or payment of our costs could be disallowed any of these actions could harm our reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we bear the risk of cost overruns in fixedprice and guaranteed maximum price contracts we may experience reduced profits or in some cases losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates 

for fiscal 2008 approximately 142 of our revenues were earned under contracts that were either fixedprice or guaranteed maximum price in nature for such contracts we bear the risk of paying some if not all of any cost overruns under fixedprice and guaranteed maximumprice contracts contract prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions including those about future economic conditions prices and availability of labor equipment and materials and other exigencies if these estimates prove inaccurate there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications or if circumstances change due to among other things unanticipated technical problems difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals changes in local laws or labor conditions weather delays changes in the costs of raw materials or our vendors’ or subcontractors’ inability to perform then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or in some cases a loss for that project if the project is significant or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects costs overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted cancelled or suspended by our clients additionally even if fully performed our backlog may not be a good indicator of our future gross margins 

at september 30 2008 our backlog totaled approximately 167 billion projects can remain in backlog for an extended time in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation termination or suspension at the discretion of the client in addition the contracts in our backlog are subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts the risk of contracts in backlog being cancelled or suspended generally increases during periods of widespread economic slowdowns accordingly there is no assurance that backlog will actually be realized as revenues in the amounts reported or if realized will result in profits 

in addition the gross margins ie contract revenue less direct costs of contracts we realize can vary considerably between contracts one aspect of our business that can have a significant effect on gross margins is the amount of passthrough costs incurred when we are directly responsible for engineering design procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client’s plant or facility we reflect the costs of materials equipment and subcontracts in both revenues and costs on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs since passthrough costs typically do not bring significant margins with them it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in revenues without experiencing a corresponding change in our gross margins 

additionally the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence future profitability in some markets there is an increasing trend towards costreimbursable contracts with incentivefee arrangements typically our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs overall safety performance overall client satisfaction and other performance criteria if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards we may receive a lower or even zero incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins accordingly there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog assuming they produce the revenues currently expected will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past 

our use of joint ventures and partnerships exposes us to risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control 

as is common in the industry we participate in projects by entering into joint ventures partnerships and similar arrangements this situation exposes us to a number of risks including the risk that our partners may be unable to fulfill their obligations to us or our clients our partners may also be unable to provide the required levels of financial support to the partnerships if these circumstances occur we may be required to provide additional services or make additional investments to ensure adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services these circumstances could also lead to disputes and litigation with our partners or clients which could impact our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we participate in joint ventures and similar arrangements in which we are not the controlling partner in these cases we have limited control over the actions of the joint venture to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture our business financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

we are dependent on third parties to complete many of our contracts 

much of the work performed under our contracts is performed by thirdparty subcontractors we hire we also rely on thirdparty equipment manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects if we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired if the amount we are required to pay 

  

for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated especially in a lumpsum or a fixedprice contract we may suffer losses on these contracts if a subcontractor supplier or manufacturer fails to provide services supplies or equipment as required under a contract for any reason we may be required to source these services equipment or supplies to other third parties on a delayed basis or at a higher price than anticipated which could impact contract profitability 

in the current economic environment thirdparties may find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to help fund their operations the inability to obtain financing could adversely affect a third party’s ability to provide materials equipment or services which could affect our financial condition and results of operations 

maintaining adequate bonding capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win fixedprice contracts 

in line with industry practice we are often required to provide performance or payment bonds to our customers these bonds indemnify the customer should we fail to perform our obligations under the contract if a bond is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain an appropriate bond we cannot pursue that project we have bonding capacity but as is typically the case the issuance of a bond is at the surety’s sole discretion moreover due to events that affect the insurance and bonding markets generally bonding may be more difficult to obtain in the future or may only be available at significant additional cost there can be no assurance that our bonding capacity will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms our inability to obtain adequate bonding and as a result to bid on new contracts that require such bonding could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

if we fail to comply with federal state local or foreign governmental requirements our business may be adversely affected 

we are subject to us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business for example we are subject to a variety of environmental health and safety laws and regulations governing among other things discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with the releases of hazardous substances and human health and safety these laws and regulations and the risk of attendant litigation can cause significant delays to a project and add significantly to its cost violations of regulations could subject us and our management to civil and criminal penalties and other liabilities 

various us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations may impose liability for property damage and costs of investigation and cleanup of hazardous or toxic substances on property currently or previously owned by us or arising out of our waste management or environmental remediation activities these laws may impose responsibility and liability without regard to knowledge of or causation of the presence of contaminants the liability under these laws is joint and several we have potential liabilities associated with our past waste management and other activities and with our current and prior ownership of various properties the discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of unforeseen cleanup obligations at these or other sites could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

when we perform our services our personnel and equipment may be exposed to radioactive and hazardous materials and conditions we may be subject to liability claims by employees customers and third parties as a result of such exposures in addition we may be subject to fines penalties or other liabilities arising under environmental or safety laws a claim if not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

such laws regulations and policies are reviewed periodically and any changes could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could for example relax or repeal laws and regulations relating to the environment which could result in a decline in the demand for our environmental services and in turn could 

  

negatively impact our revenue our failure to comply with such laws or regulations whether actual or alleged could expose us to fines penalties or potential litigation liabilities including costs settlements and judgments any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition we and many of our clients operate in highly regulated environments which may require us or our clients to obtain and to comply with federal state and local government permits and approvals any of these permits or approvals may be subject to denial revocation or modification under various circumstances failure to obtain or comply with or the loss or modification of the conditions of permits or approvals may subject us to penalties or other liabilities which can adversely affect our business financial condition or result of operations 

employee agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts which could result in reduced revenues and profits 

misconduct fraud noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations or other improper activities by one of our employees agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation such misconduct could include the failure to comply with government procurement regulations regulations regarding the protection of classified information regulations prohibiting bribery and other foreign corrupt practices regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts regulations on lobbying or similar activities regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting environmental laws and any other applicable laws or regulations for example we regularly provide services that may be highly sensitive or that relate to critical national security matters if a security breach were to occur our ability to procure future government contracts could be severely limited the precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective and we could face unknown risks or losses our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting which could weaken our ability to win contracts and result in reduced revenues and profits 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery laws 

the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices although we have procedures and controls in place to monitor internal and external compliance if we are found to be liable for fcpa violations either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the loss of one or a few customers could have an adverse effect on us 

a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years for example in fiscal 2008 fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 approximately 168 166 and 164 respectively of our revenue was earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government although we have longstanding relationships with many of our significant clients our clients may unilaterally reduce or discontinue their contracts at any time our loss of business from a significant client could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

we engage in a highly competitive business if we are unable to compete effectively we could lose market share and our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted 

we face intense competition to provide technical professional and construction services to clients the extent of such competition varies by industry geographic market and project type for example with respect to our construction and operations and maintenance services clients generally award large projects to large contractors which may give our larger competitors an advantage when bidding for these projects conversely with respect to our engineering design architectural and consulting services low barriers of entry can result in competition with smaller newer competitors if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both which if significant could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our larger competitors for engineering construction and maintenance services for process plants include bechtel fluor foster wheeler ltd urs kbr aker kvaerner technip worleyparsons and amec in the area of buildings our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr hellmuth obata  kassabaum aecom technology and turner construction in the area of infrastructure our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as parsons brinckerhoff hntb tetra tech parsons and ws atkins in the area of us federal programs our principal competitors include several of the competitors listed above as well as the shaw group saic ch2m hill weston solutions lockheed martin corporation and computer sciences corporation and in the area of pulp and paper our principal competitors include kbr and amec 

in addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in risk factors our international operations are also exposed to additional risks and uncertainties including unfavorable political developments and weak foreign economies 

for fiscal 2008 approximately 378 of our revenues was earned from clients outside the us our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations and we expect our international operations to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues at a minimum our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects both positive and negative that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar into the us dollar in addition our international operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 to the extent our international operations are affected by unexpected or adverse economic political and other conditions our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

in addition our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders although we have policies and procedures to comply with us and foreign international trade laws the violation of such laws could subject the company and its employees to civil or criminal penalties including substantial monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and could damage our reputation and therefore our ability to do business 

our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties 

our business strategy involves growth through among other things the acquisition of other companies acquiring companies present a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us in addition the current credit markets may make it more difficult and costly to finance acquisitions acquisitions may also bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 

in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make we could dilute share ownership 

one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities accordingly we filed a shelf registration statement on form s4 on december 17 2007 if we issue additional equity securities pursuant to this shelf registration statement or otherwise such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders’ individual ownership percentages in the company 

our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly which could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock 

our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors including 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 fluctuations in quarterly results could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock 

our actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our financial statements 

in preparing our financial statements our management is required under us generally accepted accounting principles to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements these estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities areas requiring significant estimates by our management include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 an impairment charge of goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

under the us financial accounting standards board’s statement of financial accounting standards no 142— goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 142 we are required to test goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis based upon a fair value approach rather than amortizing it over time as of september 30 2008 we had 9241 million of goodwill representing 216 of our total assets of 43 billion 

we have chosen to perform our annual impairment reviews of goodwill at the end of the third quarter of our fiscal year we also are required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate including a significant 

  

sustained decline in a reporting unit’s market value legal factors operating performance indicators competition sale or disposition of a significant portion of our business potential government actions toward our facilities and other factors 

if the fair value of our reporting units is less than their book value we could be required to record an impairment charge in accordance with the provisions of sfas 142 we may apply various valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of our reporting units the application of these valuation methods can be influenced by such factors as industry performance changes in technology and operating cash flows the amount of any impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results for the period in which the charge is taken 

rising inflation interest rates andor construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts in particular with respect to our fixedprice contracts 

rising inflation interest rates or construction costs could reduce the demand for our services in addition we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixedprice and may be at risk to the effects of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are guaranteed maximumprice because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from costreimbursable type contracts approximately 858 during fiscal 2008 the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor however if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixedprice and lumpsum work is more prevalent inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future therefore increases in inflation interest rates or construction costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control 

we are a delaware corporation certain antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us in addition certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover for example 

 

  

  

  

 these types of provisions as well as our shareholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders accordingly stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the purpose of this management’s discussion and analysis mda is to provide an overview of the company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations as well as an analysis of the factors that caused certain key elements of our financial statements to change from one year to the next 

in this mda we use certain terms and abbreviations that are defined as follows 

 

 overview 

net earnings for fiscal 2008 increased by 1336 million or 465 as compared to last year and earnings per share diluted grew by 438 the increase in net earnings was due primarily to significant growth in activity on contracts with clients operating in a number of industries and markets including energy and refiningdownstream upstream oil and gas national government programs and chemicals and polymers among others technical professional services revenues in fiscal 2008 increased by 15 billion or 333 as compared to last year while revenues from field services in fiscal 2008 increased by 13 billion or 322 from last year 

cash and cash equivalents totaled 6044 million at september 30 2008 this is down slightly from our balances at september 30 2007 our net cash totaled 5478 million at september 30 2008 this is also down slightly from our net cash position from a year ago we used 2641 million of cash and cash equivalents in fiscal 2008 to acquire businesses this was 1753 million more than what was spent last year additions to property and equipment during fiscal 2008 totaled 1148 million this was 502 million higher than total additions made last year most of the increase was due to expenditures relating to fittingout and expanding new and existing office space and computer system upgrades and system conversions 

our backlog increased 31 billion during fiscal 2008 from 136 billion at september 30 2007 to 167 billion at september 30 2008 

  

we had 57100 employees and contract staff personnel at september 30 2008 this is 7900 or 161 more than at september 30 2007 

critical accounting policies 

in order to understand better the changes that may occur to key elements of our financial condition and operating results a reader of this mda should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business performing longterm engineering and constructiontype contracts requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect both the entity’s results of operations and the carrying values of its assets and liabilities although our significant accounting polices are described in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue accounting for contracts and use of joint ventures —in accounting for longterm engineering and constructiontype contracts we follow the provisions of the aicpa’s statement of position 811— accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts  in general we recognize revenues at the time we provide services depending on the commercial terms of the contract we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred or using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion this method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress in making such estimates judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule the cost of materials and labor and productivity and the impact of change orders liability claims contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee in some of the markets we serve there is an increasing trend towards costreimbursable contracts with incentivefee arrangements in certain instances we base our incentive fees on achievement of target completion dates target costs andor other performance criteria failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or nonrecoverable costs which could exceed revenues recognized from the project 

we provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known without regard to the percentage of completion 

the nature of our business sometimes results in clients subcontractors or vendors presenting claims to us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible in those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract we include in the total estimated costs of the contract and therefore the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract an estimate based on all relevant facts and circumstances available of the additional costs to be incurred similarly and in the normal course of business we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible in those situations where we have presented such claims to our clients we include in revenues the amount of costs incurred without profit to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims 

certain costreimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment in this situation revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts in those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs not allowable under the terms of the contract we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly 

  

as is common in the industry we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures and consortiums for certain of these joint ventures ie where we have an undivided interest in the assets and liabilities of the venture we recognize our proportionate share of joint venture revenues costs and operating profit in our consolidated statements of earnings for other investments in engineering and construction joint ventures we use the equity method of accounting 

accounting for stock issued to employees and others —we account for sharebased payment transactions in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 123r— sharebased payment accordingly we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award 

we use the blackscholes option pricing model to compute the grant date fair value of awards of equity instruments the blackscholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions in order to compute the hypothetical fair value of a stock option changes in these assumptions can cause drastically different values being assigned to a stock option the value assigned to any stock options that may be awarded in the future as well as the related expense associated with any such awards will be dependent on the assumptions used 

accounting for pension plans —in accounting for pension plans we follow the provisions of sfas no 87— employers’ accounting for pensions  and sfas no 158— employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas 87 and sfas 158 require the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans’ assets and liabilities these assumptions include discount rates investment returns and projected salary increases among others we rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in valuing the financial position of our pension plans and to provide advice regarding the actuarial assumptions used the expected rates of return on plan assets for fiscal 2008 ranged from 50 to 90 the same as last year we believe this range of rates reflects the longterm returns expected on the plans’ assets considering recent market conditions projected rates of inflation the diversification of the plans’ assets and the expected real rates of market returns the discount rates used to compute plan liabilities were changed from a range of 520 to 575 in fiscal 2007 to a range of 525 to 625 in fiscal 2008 changes in the actuarial assumptions may have a material affect on the plans’ assets and liabilities and the associated pension expense management together with our actuaries monitor trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in order to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used 

accounting for income taxes —we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109— accounting for income taxes  fasb interpretation no 48— accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  and other applicable authoritative pronouncements judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the normal course of business we may engage in numerous transactions every day for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in taxable income or deducted as an expense is uncertain additionally the tax returns we file are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service most states in the united states and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the united states our effective tax rate was 36 in both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 we routinely monitor the appropriateness of our worldwide tax rate and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates 

contractual guarantees litigation investigations and insurance —in the normal course of business we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation the guarantees to which we are a party generally relate to project schedules and plant performance most of the litigation involves us as a defendant in workers’ compensation personal injury environmental employmentlabor professional liability and other similar lawsuits we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations we have elected however to retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under our insurance programs this situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured we intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of our contracts 

  

in accordance with sfas no 5— accounting for contingencies  we record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such guarantees litigation and insurance claims we rely on qualified actuaries and other professionals to assist us in determining the level of reserves to establish for insurancerelated claims that are known and have been asserted against us and for insurancerelated claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates we include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations 

in addition as a contractor providing services to various agencies of the united states federal government we are subject to many levels of audits investigations and claims by or on behalf of the us federal government with respect to contract performance pricing costs cost allocations and procurement practices we adjust revenues based upon the amounts we expect to realize considering the effects of any client audits or governmental investigations 

testing goodwill for impairment —in accordance with sfas no 142 —goodwill and other intangible assets  the amount of goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets is tested annually for possible impairment in conducting the impairment test we may apply in accordance with the provisions of sfas 142 various valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of our reporting units the values resulting from the application of these valuation techniques are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of our reporting units to a willing third party 

foreign currencies —we transact business in various currencies the functional currency of each of our foreign operations is the currency of the local country consequently and in accordance with sfas no 52— foreign currency translation  revenues and expenses of operations outside the united states are translated into us dollars using weightedaverage exchange rates for the applicable periods being translated while the assets and liabilities of operations outside the united states are generally translated into us dollars using periodend exchange rates the net effect of the foreign currency translation process translating the income statement accounts at rates that are different from those used to translate balance sheet accounts is included in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets our net exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses is limited because in general our various operations invoice clients and satisfy their financial obligations in their respective functional currencies in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currencies we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs in those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies in those situations we follow the provisions of sfas no 133— accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities in accounting for our derivative contracts 

results of operations 

general 

our business focuses exclusively on providing technical professional and construction services to a large number of industrial commercial and governmental clients around the world the services we provide generally fall into four broad categories 

 

  

  

   

 the scope of services we can provide our clients therefore ranges from consulting and conceptual design services which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project to complete singleresponsibility designbuildoperate contracts 

the following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each fiscal year ended september 30 in thousands 

 

 we focus our services on clients operating in certain industry groups and markets we believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit crossutilization of our resources the following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each fiscal year ended september 30 in thousands 

 

  

 fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

we recorded net earnings of 4207 million or 338 per diluted share for the fiscal year ended september 30 2008 compared to net earnings of 2871 million or 235 per diluted share for fiscal 2007 total revenues for fiscal 2008 increased by 28 billion or 328 to 113 billion compared to total revenues of 85 billion for fiscal 2007 

revenues increased among all of the industry groups and markets we serve we saw particularly robust business activity by clients in both the upstream and downstream sectors of the oil and gas industry capital spending by clients operating in the upstream markets continued to be positively influenced during fiscal 2008 by 

  

higher crude prices and although crude prices weakened toward the end of fiscal 2008 partly as a result of the late strengthening in the us dollar we do not expect to see largescale delays or cancellations by most of our major clients in fiscal 2009 we believe that in certain geographic areas in which we operate particularly in the canadian oil sands there will continue to be significant capital spending by our upstream oil and gas clients in fiscal 2009 

we also saw significant revenue growth in fiscal 2008 from projects for clients operating in the energy and refining sector of the petroleum market most of this growth related to refinery expansion projects and although we expect such spending to continue in fiscal 2009 we believe we should begin to see increased spending on more environmentallydriven projects we expect these projects will focus on removing sulfur and benzene from various fuels and complying with new ambient air quality standards 

revenues from projects for our national government clients increased by 4762 million or 317 from last year most of the increase was attributable to revenues from the us federal government on projects for research and development test engineering scientific and other technical services although revenues during fiscal 2008 from environmental engineering and remediation projects was relatively flat with fiscal 2007 we believe there are opportunities in this market to grow the business in the future 

revenues from projects performed for our buildings and infrastructure clients increased by a combined 5249 million or 469 from last year part of the increase in infrastructure and buildings work was due to the acquisition of carter  burgess inc carter  burgess in november 2007 these markets also benefited from an increase in capital spending by various clients to improve and develop their transportation infrastructure and for projects relating to hospitals medical and research facilities and other technical buildings and facilities 

revenues from projects for our clients in the chemicals and polymers industries increased by 1715 million or 139 from last year the increase was due primarily to continuing high demand to increase production capacity 

included in the increase in revenues for fiscal 2008 was a 7707 million increase in passthrough costs passthrough costs totaled 35 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to 27 billion in fiscal 2007 when we are responsible for subcontract labor or thirdparty materials and equipment we reflect the costs of such items in both revenues and costs the level of passthrough costs included in revenues and costs will vary between reporting periods depending principally on the amount of procurement that clients choose to do themselves as opposed to using our services as well as on the normal rampingup and windingdown of field services activities on construction and om projects 

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts were 846 for fiscal 2008 compared to 857 for fiscal 2007 for the remainder of this mda we refer to this percentage relationship as the “dc” the relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided generally speaking the more procurement we do on behalf of our clients ie where we purchase equipment and materials for use on projects andor procure subcontracts in connection with projects and the more field services revenues we have relative to technical professional services revenues the higher the dc will be because passthrough costs typically generate lower margins it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in revenues relating to passthrough costs without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit the decrease in the dc in fiscal 2008 as compared to last year was due primarily to a slight increase in the margin rates earned on our technical professional services revenues 

sga expenses for fiscal 2008 increased by 3220 million or 419 to 11 billion compared to 7694 million for fiscal 2007 the increase in sga expenses was partially due to the business growth we experienced in fiscal 2008 particularly in support of the technical professional services area of our business 

  

generally speaking such services require higher labor and facilities costs in order to support those activities also contributing to the increase in sga expenses was the acquisition in november 2007 of carter  burgess 

operating profit for fiscal 2008 increased by 2011 million or 455 to 6431 million compared to 4420 million for fiscal 2007 as a percentage of revenues operating profit was 57 for fiscal 2008 compared to 52 in fiscal 2007 although the company improved the margins earned on technical professional services during fiscal 2008 relative to last year the increase was offset by the higher level of sga expenses acquired with carter  burgess as the company continues to integrate carter  burgess we expect to see a reductions in sga expense 

interest income for fiscal 2008 decreased by 43 million or 218 to 154 million compared to 198 million for fiscal 2007 the decrease in interest income was due primarily to a lower rate of interest earned on our deposits during fiscal 2008 as compared to last year 

interest expense for fiscal 2008 decreased by 36 million or 450 to 44 million compared to 80 million for fiscal 2007 the decrease in interest expense was due primarily to lower average borrowings outstanding during fiscal 2008 as compared to last year 

miscellaneous income net for fiscal 2008 increased 84 million to 33 million as compared to last year included in this amount is a 106 million gain from the sale recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 of the company’s interest in a business that provides specialized operations and maintenance services for highways and associated facilities 

we recorded income tax expense of 2367 million during fiscal 2008 compared to 1615 million during fiscal 2007 our overall effective tax rate in fiscal 2008 was 36—the same as fiscal 2007 in the normal course of our business we may engage in numerous transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in income or deducted as an expense is uncertain additionally we file income franchise gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service most states in the united states and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the united states we continually monitor the appropriateness of the rate and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will change 

fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

we recorded net earnings of 2871 million or 235 per diluted share for fiscal year ended september 30 2007 compared to net earnings of 1969 million or 164 per diluted share for the year ended september 30 2006 

total revenues for fiscal 2007 increased by 11 billion or 142 to 85 billion compared to total revenues of 74 billion for fiscal 2006 revenues increased among most of the industry groups and markets we serve lead by a combined 6084 million increase or 217 in revenues from clients operating in the energy and refining and the upstream oil and gas industries also contributing to the revenue growth in fiscal 2007 were a 2406 million increase or 191 in revenues from projects for our national government programs clients a 1141 million increase or 101 in revenues from projects for our clients operating in the chemicals and polymers industries and a 1344 million increase or 246 in revenues from projects for our infrastructure clients 

with respect to projects for our clients operating in the oil and gas and refining industries revenue from the downstream sector grew by 2641 million in fiscal 2007 or 117 compared to fiscal 2006 most of this increase related to higher capital spending on projects involving the reconfiguration and expansion of existing refineries and addressing the effects of changing crude inputs – from lighter crudes to heavier crudes that contain 

  

slightly higher levels of sulfur we also saw increases in capital spending by many of our refinery clients involving projects driven by government regulations these include projects to comply with the nonroad diesel emission and other similar standards revenue from the upstream sector of the oil  gas and refining industries grew by 3443 million in fiscal 2007 or 630 compared to fiscal 2006 we saw a high level of spending in fiscal 2007 by our clients on oil and gas extraction projects particularly in the oil sands area of canada 

revenues from projects for our national government programs clients increased by 2406 million in fiscal 2007 or 191 compared to fiscal 2006 most of the increase was due to higher levels of revenue from the us federal government relating to various aerospace and defense projects revenues from projects for our clients in the chemicals and polymers industries increased by 1141 million in fiscal 2007 or 101 compared to fiscal 2006 due to continued demand to increase production capacity revenues from projects performed for our infrastructure clients increased by 1344 million in fiscal 2007 or 246 compared to fiscal 2006 part of the increase was due to the acquisition of edwards and kelcey inc edwards and kelcey in april 2007 edwards and kelcey contributed 672 million in revenues during fiscal 2007 the balance of the increase in infrastructure revenues was due to higher spending by clients on projects for improved roads highways and bridges 

included in the above increase in revenues was a 660 million increase in passthrough costs pass through costs totaled 27467 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 26807 million in fiscal 2006 pass through costs as a percentage of field services revenues in fiscal 2007 and 2006 were essentially unchanged 

the dc was 857 for fiscal 2007 compared to 874 for fiscal 2006 the decrease in the dc in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was due primarily to the increase in technical professional services revenues relative to field services revenues also contributing to the decrease in the dc was a slight increase in the margin rates earned on our technical professional services revenues 

sga expenses for fiscal 2007 increased by 1367 million or 216 to 7694 million compared to 6327 million for fiscal 2006 the increase in sga expenses was due almost entirely to the business growth we experienced in fiscal 2007 particularly in support of the technical professional services area of our business generally speaking such services require higher labor and facilities costs in order to support those activities also contributing to the increase in sga expenses was the acquisition of edwards and kelcey which contributed 228 million of sga expenses in fiscal 2007 

operating profit for fiscal 2007 increased by 1404 million or 466 to 4420 million compared to 3016 million for fiscal 2006 as a percentage of revenues operating profit was 52 for fiscal 2007 compared to 41 in fiscal 2006 the increase in operating profit during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was due primarily to the increase in technical professional services revenues the improvement in our level of sga expenses relative to technical professional services revenues and a slight improvement in the margin rates earned on our technical professional services revenues 

interest income for fiscal 2007 increased by 46 million or 299 to 198 million compared to 152 million for fiscal 2006 the increase in interest income was due primarily to higher average cash balances on deposit during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 combined with a slight increase in the rate of interest earned on our deposits 

we recorded income tax expense of 1615 million during fiscal 2007 compared to 1084 million during fiscal 2006 our overall effective tax rate was 360 for fiscal 2007 compared to 355 in fiscal 2006 the company’s overall effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was positively affected by the favorable settlement of a matter with the us internal revenue service irs offset in part by provisions recorded for certain other income tax exposures the net effect of the irs settlement and the other income tax exposures was a net reduction of 15 million to the fiscal 2006 total tax expense in the normal course of our business we may engage in numerous transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in income or deducted as an expense is uncertain additionally we file 

  

income franchise gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service most states in the united states and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the united states we continually monitor the appropriateness of the rate and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will change 

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth certain information about our contractual obligations as of september 30 2008 in thousands 

 

  

    backlog 

the following table summarizes our backlog at september 30 2008 2007 and 2006 in millions 

 

 because the entire value of a contract is added to backlog as soon as the contract is awarded to us rather than adding the contracts to backlog gradually over time and because many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years we evaluate our backlog on a yearoveryear basis rather than on a sequential quarteroverquarter basis our backlog at september 30 2008 increased by 31 billion or 229 to 167 billion from 136 billion at september 30 2007 the increase in backlog during fiscal 2008 was attributable primarily to new awards from clients operating in the downstream energy and refining and national government programs 

  

in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we removed 236 billion of revenue from backlog relating to a project in the canadian oil sands we removed the revenue which would have been performed over the next three fiscal years after being informed by the client that he intends to transfer the remaining phases of the project to another contractor the client’s decision was the result of a breakdown in our relationship with the client of the amount removed from backlog 227 billion was in field services substantially in the form of “passthrough” revenues we are working diligently to rebuild our relationship with this customer in a situation where a client terminates a contract we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and in certain instances we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs 

while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein 

total backlog at september 30 2008 included approximately 34 billion or 204 of total backlog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies this compares to approximately 22 billion or 165 of total backlog and 22 billion or 223 of total backlog of us federal backlog at september 30 2007 and 2006 respectively most of our federal contracts require that services be provided beyond one year in general these contracts must be funded annually ie the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the us congress to the procuring agency and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts 

subject to the factors discussed in item 1a— risk factors  above we estimate that approximately 94 billion or 563 of total backlog at september 30 2008 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year 

effects of inflation 

the effects of inflation on our business is discussed in detail in item 1a— risk factors  and is incorporated herein by reference 

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our operations primarily through cash provided by operations at september 30 2008 our principal source of liquidity consisted of 6044 million of cash and cash equivalents and 2343 million of available capacity under our 2900 million unsecured revolving credit facility discussed below 

during fiscal 2008 our cash and cash equivalents decreased by 89 million to 6044 million this compares to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of 1793 million during fiscal 2007 and an increase of 1942 million during fiscal 2006 during fiscal 2008 we generated net cash inflows from operating activities and financing activities of 3134 million and 988 million respectively these inflows were offset by outflows from investing activities of 4099 million and the effect of exchange rate changes of 112 million 

our operations provided net cash of 3134 million during fiscal 2008 this compares to net cash inflows of 3609 million and 2235 million during fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively the 475 million decrease in cash provided by operations in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was due primarily to a 1724 million decrease relating to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts a 171 million decrease relating to higher stock based compensation including the related excess tax benefits and 106 million of gains relating to sales of investments and other assets the cash flows from which are reclassified to the investing section within our consolidated statements of cash flows these decreases in cash flows from operations were offset in part by a 1336 million increase in net earnings a 140 million increase in depreciation and amortization of property equipment and improvements and a 34 million increase in the amortization of intangible assets 

  

we used 4099 million of cash and cash equivalents for investing activities during fiscal 2008 this compares to net cash outflow of 1658 million and 676 million during fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively the 2441 million increase in cash used for investing activities as compared to fiscal 2007 was due primarily to an additional 1753 million increase in cash used for acquisitions of businesses net of cash acquired a 513 million increase in cash used for additions to property and equipment net of disposals and changes in miscellaneous noncurrent assets of 278 million these uses were offset in part by a 103 million change in investments net included in this amount is 141 million of cash received in connection with the sale of our interest in a company that provides specialized operations and maintenance services for highways and associated facilities  

we used a total of 2641 million of cash net of cash acquired and inclusive of acquisition related costs during fiscal 2008 to acquire among other businesses carter  burgess inc lindsey engineering services limited and a 60 interest in zamel  turbag consulting engineers 

our financing activities resulted in net cash inflows of 988 million during fiscal 2008 this compares to net cash outflows of 203 million during fiscal 2007 and cash inflows of 483 million during fiscal 2006 the 1191 million increase in cash flows from financing activities during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was due primarily to a 677 million net increase in cash flows relating to our borrowing activities a 321 million increase in cash flows attributable to issuances of common stock including the related excess tax benefits and a 192 million increase to other longterm deferred liabilities 

the subprime mortgage crisis and the resulting economic downturn have significantly impacted the capital and credit markets although it is presently not possible to predict the full effect this situation will have on us the following is a discussion of some of the risks and possible consequences also please refer to item 1a— risk factors  above 

risks associated with our customers’ ability to pay for services and finance projects —although our customer base includes the us and other national governments as well as a wide range of large national and multinational companies operating in a very diverse range of markets we believe it’s possible that the current economic downturn and credit crisis may affect some of our customers’ ability to access the capital they may require to complete their projects this situation could affect us two ways first payments on our accounts receivable may not occur or be delayed second clients may be forced to delay projects that have been awarded to us if either or both of these situations were to occur it could have a significant impact on our cash flows it could also affect our future profitability if major projects are delayed too long or if they are cancelled altogether we continue to monitor our accounts receivable very closely we also stay in touch with our core clients and work closely with them monitoring the economic viability and status of their projects and programs 

risks associated with our existing credit agreement —we have a longterm unsecured revolving credit facility providing up to 2900 million of debt capacity this facility is provided by a consortium of twelve banks one of which was the subject of an acquisition transaction necessitated by severe debt and liquidity pressures a second bank in the consortium also suffering from liquidity pressures has been actively seeking additional capital outside of the ordinary course of business from investors and the government these two banks provide approximately 16 of the total credit under the facility although only 557 million was outstanding under this facility at september 30 2008 we rely on this facility to help fund our acquisition transactions as well as provide working capital the inability of one or more banks in the consortium to meet its commitment under the credit facility could impede our future growth however after reviewing the credit worthiness of the banks in the consortium we have no reason to believe that access to the credit facility is materially atrisk 

risks associated with our ability to access shortterm assets —our cash balances and shortterm investments are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located primarily in north america europe and asia none of the banks in which we hold our cash and investments have gone into bankruptcy or 

  

forced receivership or have been takenover by their governments some of our accounts hold deposits in amounts that exceed available insurance although there is no guaranty that one or more banks in which we hold our cash and investments will not fail we do not believe at present there is a material risk to our ability to access these shortterm assets 

we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future we had 6044 million in cash and cash equivalents at september 30 2008 compared to 6134 million at september 30 2007 our consolidated working capital position at september 30 2008 was 12 billion compared to 10 billion at september 30 2007 we have a longterm unsecured revolving credit facility providing up to 2900 million of debt capacity under which only 557 million was utilized at september 30 2008 in the form of direct borrowings we believe that the capacity terms and conditions of our longterm revolving credit facility is adequate for our working capital and general business requirements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we are party to financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk in the form of guarantees not reflected in our balance sheet that arise in the normal course of business however such off balance sheet arrangements will not have nor are they reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or resources that is material to investors see note 10— commitments and contingencies and derivative financial instruments of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

new accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157— fair value measurements  sfas 157 provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable sfas 157 also requires expanded disclosures to provide information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measures on earnings sfas 157 is effective for the company’s 2009 fiscal year although early adoption is permitted although the company continues to assess the potential effects of sfas 157 it does not believe that the adoption of sfas 157 will have a material affect on its consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk in the normal course of business our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

our only committed source for longterm credit is a 2900 million syndicated revolving credit facility the total amount outstanding under this facility at september 30 2008 was 557 million this agreement expires in may 2012 and provides for both fixedrate and variablerate borrowings our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we continuously monitor changes in interest rates and use cash provided from operations to repay our borrowings as quickly as possible furthermore the company can use a combination of both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk 

  

foreign currency risk 

in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency we attempt to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs in those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies we follow the provisions of sfas 133 in accounting for our derivative contracts 

at september 30 2008 we had a euro put option outstanding with a notional amount of €75 million with an average exchange rate of 14461 eurtogbp this derivative contract expires in october of 2009 we’ve determined this contract to be highly effective according to the provisions of sfas 133 the contract is recognized in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income 

at september 30 2008 we had a euro forward contract outstanding with a notional amount of €62 million with an average exchange rate of 12599 eurtogbp this derivative contract expires in april of 2009 we’ve determined this contract to be highly effective according to the provisions of sfas 133 the contract is recognized in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income 

concurrent with the fiscal 2004 acquisition of the babtie group limited we entered into a forward contract with a large us bank the purpose of the contract is to hedge the company’s exposure to fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on a £399 million intercompany loan between jacobs and one of its subsidiaries based on the terms of the contract we believe the effect of the loan on future earnings at september 30 2008 should be limited to 20 million of expense of which 07 million will be recognized in the next 12 months we recorded 07 million of expense during fiscal 2008 at september 30 2008 the notional amount of the contract was £399 million it provides for an average exchange rate of 05828 gbptousd and expires in june of 2011 we have determined that this derivative qualifies as a cash flow hedge under the provisions of sfas 133 

the fair value of derivative contracts included in other deferred liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets totaled 30 million and 86 million at september 30 2008 and september 30 2007 respectively

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

the company’s management with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined by rule 13a15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of september 30 2008 the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k the “evaluation date” based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the evaluation date 

  

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act management with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the evaluation date based on the framework established in “ internal control—integrated framework”  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management has concluded that the internal controls of the company over its financial reporting as of the evaluation date were effective the company’s independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting which appears later in this annual report on form 10k 

changes in internal control 

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the company’s quarter ended september 30 2008 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

limitations on effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its system of internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed or operated can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of internal control are met the design of the company’s control system reflects the fact that there are resource constraints and that the benefits of such control system must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control failures and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the intentional acts of individuals by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that the design of any particular control will always succeed in achieving its objective under all potential future conditions

 item 1 business 

general 

we are one of the largest professional services firms in the united states our business focuses exclusively on providing a broad range of technical professional and construction services to a large number of industrial commercial and governmental clients around the world we provide four broad categories of services project services which include engineering design architectural and similar services process scientific and systems consulting services which includes services performed in connection with a wide variety of scientific testing analysis and consulting activities construction services which encompasses traditional field construction services as well as modular construction activities and includes directhire construction and construction management services and operations and maintenance services which includes services performed in connection with operating large complex facilities on behalf of clients as well as services involving process plant maintenance we provide our services through offices and subsidiaries located principally in north america europe asia and australia 

we concentrate our services on selected industry groups and markets including oil and gas exploration production and refining programs for various national governments pharmaceuticals and biotechnology chemicals and polymers buildings which includes projects in the fields of health care and education as well as civic governmental and other buildings infrastructure technology and manufacturing consumer products and pulp and paper among others 

jacobs engineering group inc was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware on january 8 1987 on march 4 1987 the corporation succeeded by merger to the business and assets of jacobs engineering group inc a california corporation that in 1974 had succeeded to a business organized originally by our founder dr joseph j jacobs in 1947 unless the context otherwise requires all references herein to “jacobs” or the “registrant” are to jacobs engineering group inc and its predecessors and references to the “company” “we” “us” or “our” are to both jacobs engineering group inc and its consolidated subsidiaries the common stock of jacobs has been publicly held since 1970 and is currently listed on the new york stock exchange nyse 

business strategy 

general 

there are four major components of our business strategy safety a relationshipbased approach to client interactions a strong focus on cost control and an organizational structure that facilitates efficient project management and execution acquisitions play an important role in our business strategy as they allow us to expand on existing client relationships as well as develop new ones acquisitions also allow us the opportunity to leverage our cost structure across geographic areas 

  

safety 

key to the success of our business strategy is our uncompromising focus on safety providing an injury and incident free work environment is an unequivocal condition of the relationship we have with our employees it is also a paramount issue in our dealings with our clients and our safety program is a fundamental element of our overall approach to risk management a safe work environment is critical to our longterm success and growth we maintain a centralized quality and safety group to help ensure that the services we provide are delivered safely and in accordance with standard work processes unsafe job sites and office environments increase employee turnover increase the cost of a project to our clients expose us to types and levels of risk that are fundamentally unacceptable and raise our operating costs as well safe job sites and office environments on the other hand benefit our clients promote employee morale and enhance the longterm relationships we have with our clients employees and business partners 

relationshipbased business model 

our relationshipbased business model is central to our sustained growth and profitability we aggressively pursue the development of longterm affiliations and alliances with our clients by working as a partner with our clients on their capital programs we increase our understanding of their overall business needs as well as the unique technical requirements of their projects this increased understanding gives us the opportunity to provide a greater range of services to our clients we market all of our services to clients in connection with their projects where the scope of work required is within our expertise by integrating and bundling our services ie providing design engineering and construction services on the same project we can price contracts more competitively and enhance overall profitability while delivering superior value to our clients our relationshipbased business model also helps us more fully understand the risks inherent in the projects which in turn allows us to better manage those risks our approach also provides us with opportunities to market those services our clients will need in the post startup and commissioning phases of a plant such as operations and maintenance services this model however does not preclude us from undertaking discrete projects that do not conflict with our business strategy we will accept and perform discrete projects for our clients if we can negotiate acceptable pricing and other contract terms and conditions 

cost control 

another important component of our business strategy is our continual emphasis on cost control as the global economy expands and companies providing technical professional and construction services are required to compete against each other across geographic boundaries the company that can provide its clients with cost efficient solutions to their project needs has the advantage our attention to cost control throughout every level of our organization allows us to deliver superior technical professional and construction services safely efficiently and within the cost and time parameters our clients require 

organizational structure 

our organizational structure and integrated system for delivering services is another key component of our business strategy our operating units generally use a matrix organizational structure whereby our project management functions are supported by the various technical engineering design and construction disciplines that are necessary to effectively execute longterm engineering and construction contracts crucial functions such as project controls and procurement are local to each of our major offices and serve operations by providing specialized services required by projects in addition we actively employ a boundaryless approach to the way we serve our clients we do not maintain “profit centers” within the company nor do our operating groups compete against each other for contracts instead our organizational structure encourages our operating groups to work cohesively while simultaneously helping to reduce costs and promote an efficient delivery system for all of our services our multidomestic geographic strategy supports this approach by allowing each office to compete in the local market place while supporting the needs of global clients in conjunction with our global network of offices 

  

the role of acquisitions in our business strategy 

our relationshipbased business model is a significant driver of our acquisition strategy when we review potential acquisition targets we are conscious of the effect the acquisition may have on our client base we favor acquisitions that allow us to expand or enhance the range of services we provide existing clients andor gain access to new geographic areas in which our clients either already operate or plan to expand by expanding into new geographic areas and adding to our existing technical and project management capabilities we strive to position ourselves as a preferred singlesource provider of technical professional and construction services to our major clients the following is a brief description of two of our larger acquisitions over the past five years 

 

  

 in any particular year we will also make smaller acquisitions as opportunities arise 

services provided 

our business is to provide technical professional and construction services the services we provide generally fall into four broad categories project services which include engineering design architectural and similar services process scientific and systems consulting services which includes services performed in connection with a wide variety of scientific testing analysis and consulting activities construction services which encompasses traditional field construction services as well as modular construction activities and includes directhire construction and construction management services and operations and maintenance services which includes services performed in connection with operating large complex facilities on behalf of clients as well as services involving process plant maintenance the scope of services we can provide our clients therefore ranges from consulting and conceptual design services which clients often require in the very early stages of a project to complete singleresponsibility designbuildoperate contracts 

the following table sets forth our revenues from each of our four service categories for each of the five fiscal years ended september 30 in thousands of dollars 

 

   

project services 

we employ all of the engineering design architectural and related disciplines necessary to design and engineer modern process plants including projects for clients in the chemicals and polymers pharmaceuticals and biotechnology oil  gas refining food and consumer products and basic resources industries buildings including facilities for clients in the health care education and criminal justice markets as well as other buildings for clients in the private sector infrastructure projects including highways roads bridges and other transportation systems water and wastewater treatment plants water resources facilities and other similar plants and facilities technology and manufacturing facilities for clients in the aerospace automotive defense semiconductor and electronics industries consumer products manufacturing facilities pulp and paper plants and other facilities we also employ many of the requisite scientific technical and program management capabilities necessary to provide program integration testing and evaluation services for clients in the defense and aerospace industries for the us department of defense dod in support of information systems for weapons acquisition centers for the national aeronautics and space administration nasa for aerospace testing and propulsion systems and facilities and for various agencies of the us federal government in support of environmental programs 

we are capable of providing our clients with a variety of value engineering services including “safety in design” through safety in design we integrate best practices hazard analysis and risk assessment methods early in the design phase of projects taking those steps necessary to eliminate or mitigate injury and damage during the construction startup testing and commissioning and operations phases of a project 

in the area of construction management we provide our clients with a wide range of services as an agent for our clients we may act as the program director whereby we oversee on the owner’s behalf the complete planning design and construction phases of the project alternatively our services may be limited to providing construction consulting 

also included in the category of project services are certain related services such as planning scheduling procurement estimating cost engineering project accounting and quality and safety necessary to support our engineering design construction construction and program management operations and maintenance and consulting services 

process scientific and systems consulting 

we employ all of the professional and technical expertise necessary to provide a broad range of consulting services including performing pricing studies market analyses and financial projections necessary in determining the feasibility of a project performing gasoline reformulation modeling analyzing and evaluating layout and mechanical designs for complex processing plants analyzing automation and control systems analyzing designing and executing biocontainment strategies developing and performing process protocols with respect to the us food and drug administrationmandated qualification and validation requirements providing consultation on proposed railway and airport expansion projects and performing geological and metallurgical studies 

also included in this service category are the revenues relating to professional and program management services required to assist clients such as the us federal government and its agencies in a wide range of defense and aerospace related programs such services typically are more technical and scientific in nature than other project services we provide and may involve such tasks as supporting the development and testing of conventional weapons systems weapons modeling and simulations computer systems development maintenance and support evaluation and testing of missioncritical control systems and other highly technical programs and tasks 

  

construction 

we provide traditional field construction services to private and public sector clients in virtually all of the industry groups and markets to which we provide project services in the area of environmental remediation and restoration we provide environmental remedial construction services for a variety of public and private sector clients we also provide many of our clients with modular construction technology our modular construction technology is an advanced form of engineering and design offsite fabrication and assembly and field erection it provides our clients with an alternative approach to traditional methods of engineering and construction which can compress and shorten the construction schedule reduce risk and lower costs 

historically our field construction activities were focused primarily on those construction projects for which we perform much of the related engineering and design work by focusing our construction efforts on such projects we minimize the risks associated with constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared by third parties the financial risk to us of constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared by third parties may be particularly significant on fixedprice contracts therefore we generally avoid this type of project however we continue to pursue constructiononly projects where we can negotiate pricing and other acceptable contract terms 

operations and maintenance om 

om generally refers to all of the tasks required to operate and maintain large complex facilities on behalf of clients we can provide key management and support services over all of the facility’s operations including managing subcontractors and other onsite personnel within the environmental area om often includes engineering and technical support services as well as program management services necessary to remediate contaminated sites within the aerospace and defense areas om often requires us to provide the management and technical support services necessary to operate and maintain engine test facilities weapons integration and hightech simulation and verification centers such om contracts also frequently require us to provide facilities management and maintenance services utilities operations and maintenance services property management and disposition services and construction support services 

om also includes process plant maintenance services which generally involves all of the tasks required to keep a process plant typically a refinery or chemical plant in daytoday operation such tasks could include the repair and replacement of pumps piping heat exchangers and other equipment as well as “turnaround” work which involves major refurbishment that can only be performed when the plant is shut down since shutdowns are expensive to the owners of the plant turnaround work often requires maximizing the number of skilled craft personnel who can work efficiently on a project on a 24hoursperday sevendaysperweek basis we use sophisticated computer scheduling and programming to complete turnaround projects quickly and we maintain contact with a large pool of skilled craft personnel we can hire as needed on maintenance and turnaround projects 

although the gross profit margins that we realize from om services are generally lower than those associated with the other services we provide the costs to support maintenance activities are also generally lower furthermore we view om contracts as presenting a lower financial risk to the company as compared to some of the other services we provides because om contracts are normally costreimbursable in nature additionally although engineering and construction projects may be of a shortterm nature om services often result in longterm relationships with clients for example we have been providing maintenance services at several major process plants for several decades this aspect of maintenance services greatly reduces the selling costs in respect of such services 

financial information about segments 

although we describe our business in this annual report in terms of the services we provide the markets in which our clients operate and the geographic areas in which we operate we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards 

  

no 131— disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  in making this determination we considered various economic characteristics of our operations including the nature of the services we provide our internal processes for delivering those services and the types of customers we have in addition to the discussion that follows please refer to note 15— segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k 

there is a high degree of similarity of the workforces among our service categories for example engineering and design services ie services provided by persons who are degreed and in certain circumstances licensed such as engineers architects scientists and economists exist in all four service categories in addition there is a high degree of similarity among a significant component of the workforces we employ to perform om and construction projects in providing om and construction services we employ a large number of skilled craft labor personnel these may include welders pipe fitters electricians crane operators and other personnel who work on very large capital projects in the case of projects classified within the construction services category or on smaller capital projects in the case of maintenance projects classified within the om services category 

our operating units use a matrix organizational structure our results therefore are dependent on groups representing technical disciplines eg electrical engineering mechanical engineering cost engineering etc supporting project management personnel who maintain the relationship between us and our clients and who are ultimately responsible for delivering projects to our clients safely on time and on budget additionally all of our operating regions and divisions use common tools policies and procedures to manage and run their respective units these include project review meetings project performance evaluations and project execution plans 

the use of technology throughout our organization is highly uniform whether it is pcbased computer aided design and drafting cadd applications used by our engineering and design staff or pcbased modeling programs used by the scientific and consulting staff or pcbased scheduling estimating and cost control applications used by homeoffice personnel in support of our construction and maintenance activities all of the service categories described above are equally affected by changes in technology as they occur in the economy at large 

furthermore the types of information and internal reports used by management to monitor performance evaluate results of operations allocate resources and otherwise manage the business support a single reportable segment accordingly based on these similarities we have concluded that our operations may be aggregated into one reportable segment for purposes of this disclosure 

industry groups and markets 

we provide our services to clients that operate in the following industry groups and markets energy and refining—downstream longterm programs for various national governments including the us chemicals and polymers oil and gas—upstream pharmaceuticals and biotechnology infrastructure buildings and other general industrial and consumer businesses and markets such as technology and manufacturing pulp and paper food and consumer products and mining and minerals we believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit crossutilization of our resources and help to mitigate the negative effects of a downturn in a single industry 

  

the following table sets forth our revenues from each of the various industry groups and markets in which our clients operate for each of the five fiscal years ended september 30 in thousands of dollars 

 

  energy  refining—downstream 

we provide fullservice engineering design construction and management services to our clients in the downstream sector of the energy  refining industries typical projects include new design and construction revamps or expansions of existing plants upgrades of individual process units within refineries and maintenance services we also provide a broad range of consulting services to our clients including process assessments facility appraisals feasibility studies technology evaluations project finance structuring and support and multiclient subscription services 

government regulations continue to influence the need for project services by our clients in the refining industry we see ongoing project activity in refining due to formulation and sulfur directives new and existing regulations in areas such as offroad ultra low sulfur diesel ambient air quality standards removal of benzene from gasoline and sulfur from bunker fuels will continue to drive new investment requirements in the industry over the next several years we are actively involved in such regulatorybased projects in addition to our extensive experience in these types of projects we offer a recognized proprietary and patented sulfur removal technology superclaus which has a strong market share for installed capacity biofuels and particularly biodiesel is an area of increasing activity and opportunity we are already working on a number of these projects in europe 

refineries are also responding to changes in feedstock price and availability as well as the product market this is leading to investment to facilitate processing heavier crude with higher sulfur content and producing a different product slate responding to increased demand for diesel our north american and european offices continue to be very involved in this market in addition investment in new refinery capacity in the middle east and asia is occurring due to the overall desire to add value at source and to respond to the regional consumption growth we are supporting this investment through specialist consultancy and project services from our growing local offices we are also involved with capacity expansion projects in the us 

we have also used our modular construction capabilities on a number of projects in the energy and refining industry in the us and european refining markets many projects involve revamping existing processing units or adding new processes to an existing refinery as a result of the close proximity of processing units in these refineries we believe using modular construction can decrease congestion at the construction site modular construction can also provide cost and project execution benefits in remote locations 

we provide maintenance services to our clients in the refining industry and have also established a number of formal alliances with various clients some of these alliances are both domestic us and international in scope 

  

in this industry group we also include power generation and cogeneration projects we provide technical assistance project management design engineering procurement construction and construction management and maintenance services to our clients in the power generation and supply industry and for power generating units within our customers’ process facilities typical projects include simple and combined cycle power projects cogeneration power plants aeroderivative and industrial gas turbines and emergency power generation stations the industry is now focusing on gasification as high energy prices an increasing need for hydrogen and power availability of lower priced solid fuels and the potential to sequester co2 emissions make this technology a new area for project development

backlog 

for information regarding our backlog refer to item 7— management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  below 

significant customers 

the following table sets forth the percentage of total revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal government for each of the five fiscal years ended september 30 

 

 it is rare for a commercial customer to contribute 10 or more of the company’s total revenue on occasion however we will perform a number of field services projects for a single customer in the same fiscal year which primarily because of the amount of passthrough costs discussed below that is included in revenue will cause total revenue from that customer to exceed 10 of total consolidated revenues for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 revenues earned from valero energy corporation accounted for 102 of total consolidated revenues 

  

financial information about geographic areas 

the financial information regarding geographic areas in which we operate is included in note 15— segment information of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k and is incorporated herein by reference 

contracts 

while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake our contracts generally fall into three broad categories costreimbursable fixedprice and guaranteed maximum price the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts for each of the five fiscal years ended september 30 

 

 in accordance with industry practice most of our contracts including those with the us federal government are subject to termination at the discretion of the client contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination 

when we are directly responsible for engineering design procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client’s plant or facility we reflect the costs of materials equipment and subcontracts in both revenues and costs on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs the following table sets forth the approximate amount of such passthrough costs included in revenues for each of the five fiscal years ended september 30 in thousands of dollars 

 

 costreimbursable contracts 

costreimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit the profit element may be in the form of a simple markup applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee or a combination of a markup and a fee the fee element can also take several forms the fee may be a fixed amount as specified in the contract it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred or it may be an incentive fee based on targets milestones or performance factors defined in the contract in general we prefer costreimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price 

fixedprice contracts 

fixedprice contracts include both “lump sum bid” contracts and “negotiated fixedprice” contracts under lump sum bid contracts we are required to bid against other contractors based on specifications the client furnishes this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period additionally it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients which is contrary to our relationshipbased business model accordingly lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract under a negotiated fixedprice contract we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client negotiated fixedprice contracts frequently exist in singleresponsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project thus although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client the lump sum bid 

  

contract provides the greater degree of risk to us however because of economies that may be realized during the contract term both negotiated fixedprice and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts over the past five years most of our fixedprice work has been either negotiated fixedprice contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services rather than turnkey construction 

guaranteed maximum price contracts 

guaranteed maximum price contracts are performed in the same manner as costreimbursable contracts however the total actual cost plus the fee cannot exceed the guaranteed price negotiated with the client if the total actual cost of the contract exceeds the guaranteed maximum price then we will bear at least some if not all of the excess in those cases where the total actual cost and fee are less than the guaranteed price we will often share the savings on a predetermined basis with the client these contracts are not our preferred form of contract because they often contribute to an adversarial relationship with clients which is contrary to our relationshipbased business model 

competition 

for information regarding the competitive conditions in our business please refer to item 1a— risk factors  below 

employees 

at september 30 2007 we had approximately 36400 fulltime staff employees including contract staff additionally as of september 30 2007 there were approximately 12800 persons employed in the field on a project basis the number of field employees varies in relation to the number and size of the maintenance and construction projects in progress at any particular time

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend we engage in a highly competitive business increased competition for professional services could reduce our market share and profits 

there is intense competition to provide the various technical professional services and construction and construction management services we provide the extent of such competition varies according to the industries and markets in which our clients operate as well as the geographic areas in which we operate the degree and type of competition we face is also often influenced by the type of projects for which we compete for example with respect to our construction and operations and maintenance services clients generally award large projects multimillion dollar designbuild and program management projects for example to large contractors some of our competitors are larger and may possess greater resources than we do which may give them an advantage when bidding for certain of these large projects conversely the relatively small amount of capital required for a business providing engineering design architectural and consulting services creates a relative ease of market entry for a new entrant possessing acceptable professional qualifications and certifications as a result our competitors range from small local or regional firms to large national and international organizations if we are unable to compete effectively in the geographic areas in which we operate we may experience a loss of market share or reduced profitability or both 

  

our larger competitors for engineering construction and maintenance services for process plants include the bechtel corporation fluor corporation foster wheeler ltd washington group international kbr inc aker kvaerner technip worleyparsons and amec plc in the area of buildings our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr inc hellmuth obata  kassabaum aecom technology and turner construction in the area of infrastructure our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as parsons brinckerhoff urs corporation hntb tetra tech inc parsons corporation and ws atkins in the area of us federal programs our principal competitors include several of the competitors listed above as well as the shaw group saic ch2m hill weston solutions lockheed martin corporation and computer sciences corporation and in the area of pulp and paper our principal competitors include bek and amec plc 

our continued success is dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel 

there is intense demand for employees who are able to perform the services we provide the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain personnel including engineers architects designers and corporate management professionals who have the necessary and required experience and expertise in addition there is significant demand for qualified craft personnel in the geographic areas where our construction and maintenance sites are located in certain geographic areas we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel if we cannot find and retain highly qualified and trained engineers architects designers and corporate management employees or hire skilled craft personnel as needed it could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 

the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the nature of our business occasionally results in clients subcontractors and vendors presenting claims against us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible similarly and in the normal course of business we may present claims and change orders to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible or for services provided that were either requested by the client or were otherwise required by the nature of the project if we fail to document properly the nature of our claims and change orders or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients subcontractors and vendors we could incur cost overruns and experience reduced profits or in some cases suffer a loss for that project additionally irrespective of how well we document the nature of our claims and changeorders the cost to prosecute and defend claims and changeorders can be significant 

in the normal course of business we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation generally such guarantees relate to project schedules and plant performance most of the litigation in which we are involved as a defendant relates to workers’ compensation personal injury environmental employmentlabor professional liability and other similar lawsuits we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations however we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under our insurance programs which may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured 

construction sites and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces if we fail to maintain safe work sites we can be exposed to significant financial losses as well as civil and criminal proceedings 

construction sites and maintenance sites are inherently dangerous workplaces construction and maintenance projects often require putting our employees in close proximity with large pieces of mechanized equipment moving vehicles chemical and manufacturing processes and highlyregulated materials on those projects where we are responsible for site safety we are obligated to implement procedures to ensure that workers are not injured in the event we either fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective our employees and other may become injured and we could incur significant financial losses in addition the company could be found liable for failing to comply with government regulations dealing with occupational health and safety 

  

regulations dealing with occupational health and safety are continually evolving we maintain functional groups within the company whose primary purpose is to ensure that effective health safety and environmental hse work procedures are implemented throughout our organization including construction sites and maintenance sites in spite of these efforts the company could suffer losses relating to safety issues at our construction and maintenance sites or fail to comply with all hse regulations applicable to our business 

we perform certain contracts through partnerships and joint ventures participation in joint ventures exposes us to certain other risks and uncertainties 

as is common in the industry we execute certain contracts jointly with other contractors through various forms of joint ventures including general partnerships these arrangements expose us to a number of risks including the risk that our partners may not be able to fulfill their obligations under the partnership agreements and related client contracts there is also a risk that our partners may be incapable of providing the required financial support to the partnerships disputes can arise not only between us and our joint venture partners but also between the joint ventures and the clients 

the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted cancelled or suspended by our clients additionally even if fully performed our backlog may not be a good indicator of our future gross margins 

at september 30 2007 our backlog totaled approximately 136 billion in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client in addition our backlog is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts accordingly there is no assurance that the amount of backlog inhand at september 30 2007 will actually be realized as revenues 

the gross margins ie contract revenue less direct costs of contracts can vary considerably between contracts one aspect of our business that can have a significant effect on the gross margins we realize on our contracts and projects is the amount of passthrough costs incurred when we are directly responsible for engineering design procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client’s plant or facility we reflect the costs of materials equipment and subcontracts in both revenues and costs on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs since passthrough costs typically do not bring significant margins with them it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in revenues without experiencing a corresponding change in our gross margins 

additionally the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence future profitability in some of the markets we serve there is an increasing trend towards cost–reimbursable contracts with incentivefee arrangements typically our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs overall safety performance overall client satisfaction andor other performance criteria if we fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards we may receive a lower or even zero incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins accordingly there is no assurance that the contracts in backlog assuming they produce the revenues currently expected will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past 

our business is dependent on the timing and funding of new awards and we are vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the markets in which our clients operate 

we provide technical professional and construction services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration production and refining longterm programs for various national governments including the us chemicals and polymers pharmaceuticals and biotechnology infrastructure buildings and other general industrial and consumer businesses and markets such as technology and manufacturing pulp and paper food and consumer products and mining and minerals these individual markets are generally cyclical in nature because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards we 

  

are therefore vulnerable to unanticipated downturns in our clients’ markets and industries as a result our past results have varied considerably and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the industries listed above and the geographic regions in which we operate 

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risks relating to future funding and compliance 

contracts with the united states and other governments and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties restrictions and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities and profit and cost controls in the us government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with congressional funding the us federal government is under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for a program may even be eliminated 

in addition us government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socioeconomic requirements for example we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation the truth in negotiations act the cost accounting standards the service contract act and department of defense security regulations we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices environmental protection recordkeeping and accounting if we fail to comply with any of these regulations requirements or statutes our existing government contracts could be terminated and we could be temporarily suspended or even debarred from government contracting or subcontracting 

we also run the risk of the effects of government audits investigations and proceedings and socalled “qui tam” actions brought by individuals or the government under the us federal false claims act that if an unfavorable result occurs could impact our profits and financial condition as well as our ability to obtain future government work for example government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors if these agencies determine that a rule or regulation has been violated a variety of penalties can be imposed including monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties all of which would harm our reputation with the government or even debar us from future government activities 

if one or more of our government contracts are terminated for any reason including for convenience if we are suspended from government contract work or if payment of our costs is disallowed we could suffer a significant reduction in expected revenues and profits 

we bear the risk of cost overruns in fixedprice and guaranteed maximum price contracts these contracts accounted for approximately 12 of our fiscal 2007 revenues we may experience reduced profits or in some cases losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates 

for the year ended september 30 2007 approximately 12 of our revenues was earned under contracts that were either fixedprice or guaranteed maximum price in nature for such contracts we bear the risk of paying some if not all of any cost overruns under fixed price and guaranteed maximumprice contracts contract prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates which are based on a number of assumptions including assumptions about future economic conditions prices and availability of labor equipment and materials and other exigencies if these estimates prove inaccurate or if circumstances change such as unanticipated technical problems difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals changes in local laws or labor conditions weather delays cost of raw materials or our suppliers’ or subcontractors’ inability to perform cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or in some cases a loss for that project errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications can also lead to costoverruns 

  

international operations unfavorable political developments natural disasters and weak foreign economies may seriously harm our financial condition 

for the year ended september 30 2007 approximately 41 of our revenues was earned from clients outside the us our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations and we expect that our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues at a minimum our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects both positive and negative that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar into the us dollar in addition our international operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 rising inflation interest rates andor construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts in particular with respect to our fixed price contracts 

because a significant portion of our revenues are earned from costreimbursable type contracts approximately 88 during fiscal 2007 the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor however we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixedprice and may be at risk to the effects of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are guaranteed maximumprice in addition rising inflation interest rates andor construction costs could reduce the demand for our services furthermore if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixedprice and lumpsum work is more prevalent inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future therefore increases in inflation interest rates andor construction costs could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

our business strategy relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties 

our business strategy involves growth through among other things the acquisition of other companies such growth involves a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 in addition there is no assurance that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us acquisitions may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 

in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make we could dilute share ownership 

we grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities should we issue additional equity securities such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing stockholders’ individual ownership percentages in the company 

delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control 

we are a delaware corporation certain antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us in addition certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover for example 

 

  

  

  

 these types of provisions as well as our shareholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders accordingly stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the purpose of this management’s discussion and analysis mda is to provide an overview of the company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations as well as an analysis of the factors that caused certain key elements of our financial statements to change from one year to the next 

in this mda we use certain terms and abbreviations that are defined as follows 

 

 overview 

net earnings in fiscal 2007 increased by 902 million or 458 as compared to last year and eps diluted grew by 433 contributing to the growth in net earnings was increased activity on contracts with clients in a number of industries and markets including energy and refiningdownstream upstream oil and gas national government programs and chemicals and polymers project services revenues increased by 9339 million or 323 in fiscal 2007 as compared to last year project services consist of engineering design architectural and other “home office” services that typically bring higher gross margin rates as compared to our “field services” 

cash and cash equivalents totaled 6134 million at september 30 2007 an increase of 1793 million or 413 as compared to september 30 2006 our “net cash” position defined as cash and cash equivalents less bank debt was 5724 million at september 30 2007 an increase of 2305 million or 674 as compared to september 30 2006 additions to property and equipment used 646 million of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2007 as compared to 540 million last year our cash balances combined with a borrowing capacity of 2900 million under our longterm unsecured revolving credit facility provide sufficient capital resources for us to fund our ongoing operations 

  

critical accounting policies 

in order to understand better the changes that may occur to key elements of our financial condition and operating results a reader of this mda should be aware of the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business performing longterm engineering and constructiontype contracts requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect both the entity’s results of operations and the carrying values of its assets and liabilities although our significant accounting polices are described in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies that are especially critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue accounting for contracts and use of joint ventures —in accounting for longterm engineering and constructiontype contracts we follow the provisions of the aicpa’s statement of position 811— accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts  in general we recognize revenues at the time we provide services depending on the commercial terms of the contract we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred or using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion this method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress in making such estimates judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule the cost of materials and labor and productivity and the impact of change orders liability claims contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee in some of the markets we serve there is an increasing trend towards costreimbursable contracts with incentivefee arrangements in certain instances we base our incentive fees on achievement of target completion dates target costs andor other performance criteria failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or nonrecoverable costs which could exceed revenues recognized from the project one such incentivefee contract is with the us department of energy for the fernald closure project the “fernald project” this contract provides for incentive fees based on schedule and cost in addition the terms of the contract provide that the incentive fees may not be fully billed to the doe until the completion of the project which we estimate to occur in fiscal 2008 at september 30 2007 and 2006 there was 54 million and 400 million respectively of fees relating to the fernald project recognized as receivables in our consolidated balance sheets 

we provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known without regard to the percentage of completion 

the nature of our business sometimes results in clients subcontractors or vendors presenting claims to us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible in those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract we would include in the total estimated costs of the contract and therefore the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract an estimate based on all relevant facts and circumstances available of the additional costs to be incurred similarly and in the normal course of business we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible in those situations where we have presented such claims to our clients we include in revenues the amount of costs incurred without profit to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims 

certain costreimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment in this situation revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts in those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs not allowable under the terms of the contract we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly 

  

as is common in the industry we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures and consortiums for certain of these joint ventures ie where we have an undivided interest in the assets and liabilities of the venture we recognize our proportionate share of joint venture revenues costs and operating profit in our consolidated statements of earnings for other investments in engineering and construction joint ventures we use the equity method of accounting 

accounting for stock issued to employees and others —effective october 1 2005 we began accounting for stock issued to employees and outside directors in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 123r— sharebased payment sfas 123r superseded apb opinion no 25— accounting for stock issued to employees and requires that we measure the value of services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grantdate fair value of the award the computed fair value is recognized as a noncash cost over the period the employee provides services 

we use the blackscholes option pricing model to compute the grant date fair value of the award the blackscholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions in order to compute the hypothetical fair value of a stock option changes in these assumptions can cause drastically different values being assigned to a stock option the value assigned to any stock options that may be awarded in the future as well as the related expense associated with any such awards will be dependent on the assumptions used 

accounting for pension plans —in accounting for pension plans we follow the provisions of sfas no 87— employers’ accounting for pensions  and sfas no 158— employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas 87 requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans’ assets and liabilities these assumptions involve discount rates investment returns and projected salary increases among others we rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in valuing the financial position of the plans and to provide advice regarding the actuarial assumptions used the expected rates of return on plan assets for fiscal 2007 ranged from 50 to 90 which is unchanged from last year we believe this range of rates reflects the longterm returns expected on the plans’ assets considering projected rates of inflation the diversification of the plans’ assets and the expected real rates of market returns the discount rates used to compute plan liabilities were changed from a range of 475 to 625 in fiscal 2006 to a range of 520 to 575 in fiscal 2007 changes in the actuarial assumptions may have a material affect on the plans’ assets and liabilities and the associated pension expense management together with our actuaries monitor trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in order to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas 158 sfas 158 requires companies to i recognize the funded statuses of their singleemployer defined benefit postretirement plans as assets or liabilities in their balance sheets ii recognize as a component of other comprehensive income net of tax the gains or losses that arise during the period being reported but are not recognized as a component of periodic benefit cost under existing accounting rules and iii measure defined benefit pension plan assets and obligations as of the date of the sponsor’s balance sheet in fiscal 2007 we were required to initially recognize the funded statuses of our defined benefit pension plans in our consolidated balance sheet which resulted in a 450 million aftertax gain in accumulated other comprehensive income the other provisions of sfas 158 relating to the change in measurement date of the plans’ assets and liabilities is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2008 ie september 30 2009 for us the change in measurement date is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

accounting for income taxes —we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109— accounting for income taxes  and other applicable authoritative pronouncements judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the normal course of business we may engage in numerous transactions every day for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in taxable income or deducted as an expense is uncertain additionally the tax returns we file are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service most states in the 

  

united states and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the united states our effective tax rate was 360 in fiscal 2007 355 in fiscal 2006 and 372 in fiscal 2005 we routinely monitor the appropriateness of our worldwide tax rate and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates 

in july 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48— accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company’s financial statements in accordance with sfas 109 fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an entity’s tax return fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 ie fiscal 2008 for us we continue to evaluate the impact of fin 48 but do not expect the adoption to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

insurance matters litigation claims and contingencies —in the normal course of business we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation the guarantees to which we are a party generally relate to project schedules and plant performance most of the litigation involves us as a defendant in workers’ compensation personal injury environmental employmentlabor professional liability and other similar lawsuits we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations we have elected however to retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under our insurance programs this situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured we intend to mitigate any such future liability by continuing to exercise prudent business judgment in negotiating the terms and conditions of our contracts 

in accordance with sfas no 5— accounting for contingencies  we record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such claims guarantees litigation and audits and investigations we rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in determining the level of reserves to establish for insurancerelated claims that are known and have been asserted against us and for insurancerelated claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates we include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations 

in addition as a contractor providing services to various agencies of the united states federal government we are subject to many levels of audits investigations and claims by or on behalf of the us federal government with respect to contract performance pricing costs cost allocations and procurement practices 

testing goodwill for impairment —in accordance with sfas no 142 —goodwill and other intangible assets  the amount of goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets is tested annually for possible impairment in conducting the impairment test we may apply in accordance with the provisions of sfas 142 various valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of our reporting units the values resulting from the application of these valuation techniques are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of our reporting units to a willing third party 

foreign currencies —we transact business in various currencies the functional currency of each of our foreign operations is the currency of the local country consequently and in accordance with sfas no 52— foreign currency translation  revenues and expenses of operations outside the united states are translated into us dollars using weightedaverage exchange rates for the applicable periods being translated while the assets and liabilities of operations outside the united states are translated into us dollars using periodend exchange rates the net effect of the foreign currency translation process translating the income statement accounts at rates that are different from those used to translate the balance sheet accounts is included in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets our net exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses is limited because in general our various operations invoice clients and satisfy their financial obligations in their respective functional currencies in 

  

situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currencies we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs in those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies in those situations we follow the provisions of sfas no 133— accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities in accounting for our derivative contracts 

results of operations 

general 

our business focuses exclusively on providing technical professional and construction services to a large number of industrial commercial and governmental clients around the world the services we provide generally fall into four broad categories 

 

  

  

  

 the scope of services we can provide our clients therefore ranges from consulting and conceptual design services which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project to complete singleresponsibility designbuildoperate contracts 

the following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each year ended september 30 in thousands 

 

   

we focus our services on clients operating in certain industry groups and markets we believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit crossutilization of our resources the following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each year ended september 30 in thousands 

 

   fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

we recorded net earnings of 2871 million or 235 per diluted share for fiscal year ended september 30 2007 compared to net earnings of 1969 million or 164 per diluted share for fiscal 2006 

total revenues for fiscal 2007 increased by 11 billion or 142 to 85 billion compared to total revenues of 74 billion for fiscal 2006 revenues increased among most of the industry groups and markets we serve lead by a combined 6084 million increase or 217 in revenues from clients operating in the energy and refining and the upstream oil and gas industries also contributing to the revenue growth in fiscal 2007 were a 2406 million increase or 191 in revenues from projects for our national government programs clients a 1141 million increase or 101 in revenues from projects for our clients operating in the chemicals and polymers industries and a 1344 million increase or 246 in revenues from projects for our infrastructure clients 

with respect to projects for our clients operating in the oil  gas and refining industries revenue from the downstream sector grew by 2641 million or 117 from last year most of this increase continues to relate to higher capital spending on projects involving the reconfiguration and expansion of existing refineries and addressing the effects of changing crude inputs—from lighter crudes to heavier crudes that contain slightly higher levels of sulfur more recently we have seen increased capital spending by many of our refinery clients involving projects driven by government regulations these include projects to comply with the nonroad diesel emission and other similar standards revenue from the upstream sector of the oil  gas and refining industries grew by 3443 million or 630 from last year we continued to see a high level of spending in fiscal 2007 by our clients on oil and gas extraction projects particularly in the oil sands area of canada 

revenues from projects for our national government programs clients increased by 2406 million or 191 from last year most of the increase was due to higher levels of revenue from the us federal government relating to various aerospace and defense projects revenues from projects for our clients in the chemicals and polymers industries increased by 1141 million or 101 due to continued demand to increase production capacity revenues from projects performed for our infrastructure clients increased by 1344 million or 246 

  

from last year part of the increase was due to the acquisition of edwards and kelcey inc edwards and kelcey in april 2007 edwards and kelcey contributed 672 million in revenues during fiscal 2007 the balance of the increase in infrastructure revenues was due to higher spending by clients on projects for improved roads highways and bridges 

included in the above increase in revenues was a 660 million increase in passthrough costs pass through costs totaled 27467 million in fiscal 2007 compared to 26807 million in fiscal 2006 when we are responsible for subcontract labor or thirdparty materials and equipment we reflect the costs of such items in both revenues and costs the level of passthrough costs included in revenues and costs will vary between reporting periods depending principally on the amount of procurement that clients choose to do themselves as opposed to using our services as well as on the normal rampingup and windingdown of field services activities on construction and om projects pass through costs as a percentage of field services revenues in fiscal 2007 and 2006 were essentially unchanged 

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts were 857 for fiscal 2007 compared to 874 for fiscal 2006 for the remainder of this mda we refer to this percentage relationship as the “dc” the relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided generally speaking the more procurement we do on behalf of our clients ie where we purchase equipment and materials for use on projects andor procure subcontracts in connection with projects and the more field services revenues we have relative to technical professional services revenues the higher the dc will be because passthrough costs typically generate lower margins it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in revenues relating to passthrough costs without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit the decrease in the dc in fiscal 2007 as compared to last year was due primarily to the increase in technical professional services revenues relative to field services revenues also contributing to the decrease in the dc was a slight increase in the margin rates earned on our technical professional services revenues 

sga expenses for fiscal 2007 increased by 1367 million or 216 to 7694 million compared to 6327 million for fiscal 2006 the increase in sga expenses was due almost entirely to the business growth we experienced in fiscal 2007 particularly in support of the technical professional services area of our business generally speaking such services require higher labor and facilities costs in order to support those activities also contributing to the increase in sga expenses was the acquisition of edwards and kelcey which contributed 228 million of sga expenses in fiscal 2007 

operating profit for fiscal 2007 increased by 1404 million or 466 to 4420 million compared to 3016 million for fiscal 2006 as a percentage of revenues operating profit was 52 for fiscal 2007 compared to 41 in fiscal 2006 the increase in operating profit during fiscal 2007 as compared to last year was due primarily to the increase in technical professional services revenues the improvement in our level of sga expenses relative to technical professional services revenues and a slight improvement in the margin rates earned on our technical professional services revenues 

interest income for fiscal 2007 increased by 46 million or 299 to 198 million compared to 152 million for fiscal 2006 the increase in interest income was due primarily to higher average cash balances on deposit during fiscal 2007 as compared to last year combined with a slight increase in the rate of interest earned on our deposits 

we recorded income tax expense of 1615 million during fiscal 2007 compared to 1084 million during fiscal 2006 our overall effective tax rate was 360 for fiscal 2007 compared to 355 last year the company’s overall effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was positively affected by the favorable settlement of a matter with the us internal revenue service irs offset in part by provisions recorded for certain other income tax exposures the net effect of the irs settlement and the other income tax exposures was a net reduction of 15 million to the fiscal 2006 total tax expense in the normal course of our business we may 

  

engage in numerous transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in income or deducted as an expense is uncertain additionally we file income franchise gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service most states in the united states and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the united states we continually monitor the appropriateness of the rate and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will change 

fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

we recorded net earnings of 1969 million or 164 per diluted share for fiscal year ended september 30 2006 compared to net earnings of 1316 million or 112 per diluted share for fiscal 2005 

total revenues for fiscal 2006 increased by 18 billion or 317 to 74 billion compared to total revenues of 56 billion for fiscal 2005 revenues increased among most of the industry groups and markets we serve lead by a 524 increase in revenues from clients operating in the chemicals and polymers markets and a 432 increase in revenues from clients operating in the energy and refiningdownstream industries the increase in revenues from clients operating in the chemicals and polymers markets was driven by demand by a number of our clients to increase capacity the increase in revenues from our clients operating in the oil  gas and refining industries was due primarily to new and continuing projects reconfiguring existing refineries in order to increase production and address the effects of changing crude inputs—from lighter crudes to heavier crudes that contain slightly higher levels of sulfur 

also contributing to the increase in revenues were new awards in the oil  gas upstream market relating to oil sands extraction projects as well as a 11452 million increase in passthrough costs the increase in passthrough costs from fiscal 2005 to 2006 was consistent with the overall increase in field services revenues 

the dc was 874 for fiscal 2006 compared to 857 for fiscal 2005 the increase in the dc in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005 was due to the increase in field services activity combined with slightly lower fees from our technical professional services revenues offset in part by slightly higher fees from field services 

we were successful in keeping sga growth inline with our increased business activity during fiscal 2006 sga expenses during fiscal 2006 increased by 413 million or 70 to 6327 million compared to 5914 million during fiscal 2005 contributing to the increase in sga expenses was increased professional technical services activity and the effects of foreign currency translation sga expense as a percentage of revenue decreased from 105 in fiscal 2005 to 85 in fiscal 2006 sga expense as a percentage of gross margin decreased from 733 in fiscal 2005 to 677 in fiscal 2006 contributing to the decrease in these relationships is the result of increased field services activity which generally requires less sga expense to support 

operating profit for fiscal 2006 increased by 867 million or 403 to 3016 million compared to 2149 million during fiscal 2005 the increase in operating profit during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was due to the overall increase in business activity as a percentage of revenues operating profit was 41 for fiscal 2006 compared to 38 in fiscal 2005 notwithstanding the increase in the direct costs of contracts as a percentage of revenue the company was able to increase its operating profit by limiting the increase in sga expenses 

interest income increased by 109 million to 152 million during fiscal 2006 compared to 43 million of interest income during fiscal 2005 included in interest income for fiscal 2006 is 33 million relating to the favorable settlement of a matter with the irs discussed below the balance of the increase in interest income was a result of higher cash balances on deposit during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 interest expense increased by 10 million to 75 million during fiscal 2006 compared to 65 million of interest expense during fiscal 2005 the increase in interest expense is due primarily to higher levels of borrowing by our operations outside the us in support of the growth in business combined with slightly higher interest rates 

  

we recorded income tax expense of 1084 million during fiscal 2006 compared to 779 million during fiscal 2005 our overall effective tax rate was 355 during fiscal 2006 compared to 372 for fiscal 2005 the overall effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was impacted by the favorable settlement of a matter with the irs offset in part by provisions recorded for certain other income tax exposures the net effect of the irs settlement and the other income tax exposures was a net reduction to the company’s income tax expense of 15 million impacting the overall effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 was certain stockbased compensation expense amounts relating to the company’s employee stock purchase plans where no tax benefit was available to the company in the normal course of our business we may engage in numerous transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in income or deducted as an expense is uncertain additionally we file income franchise gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service most states in the united states and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the united states we continually monitor the appropriateness of the rate and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will change 

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth certain information about our contractual obligations as of september 30 2007 in thousands 

 

     backlog 

the following table summarizes our backlog at september 30 2007 2006 and 2005 in millions 

 

   

because the entire value of contracts is added to backlog as soon as the contracts are awarded to us rather than adding the contracts to backlog gradually over time and many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years we evaluate our backlog on a yearoveryear basis rather than on a sequential quarteroverquarter basis our backlog at september 30 2007 increased by 38 billion or 389 to 136 billion from 98 billion at september 30 2006 the increase in backlog during fiscal 2007 was attributable primarily to new awards from clients operating in the upstream oil  gas and downstream energy and refining industries 

in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client however we have not experienced cancellations that have had a material effect on the reported backlog amounts in a situation where a client terminates a contract we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and in certain instances we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein 

total backlog at september 30 2007 included approximately 22 billion or 165 of total backlog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies this compares to approximately 22 billion or 223 of total backlog and 22 billion or 253 of total backlog of us federal backlog at september 30 2006 and 2005 respectively most of our federal contracts require that services be provided beyond one year in general these contracts must be funded annually ie the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the us congress to the procuring agency and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts 

subject to the factors discussed in item 1a— risk factors  above we estimate that approximately 77 billion or 565 of total backlog at september 30 2007 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our operations primarily through cash provided by operations at september 30 2007 our principal source of liquidity consisted of 6134 million of cash and cash equivalents and 2496 million of available capacity under our 2900 million unsecured revolving credit facility discussed below 

during fiscal 2007 our cash and cash equivalents increased by 1793 million to 6134 million this compares to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of 1942 million during fiscal 2006 and an increase of 1398 million during fiscal 2005 during fiscal 2007 we experienced net cash inflows from operating activities of 3609 million additionally we experienced a 45 million increase resulting from changes in exchange rates during fiscal 2007 these inflows were offset in part by net cash outflows from investing activities and financing activities of 1658 million and 203 million respectively 

our operations provided net cash of 3609 million during fiscal 2007 this compares to net cash inflows of 2235 million and 1503 million during fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively the 1373 million increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was due primarily to a 902 million increase in net earnings a 534 million increase relating to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts and increases in certain noncash items including an increase of 91 million in depreciation and amortization of property equipment and improvements and a 08 million increase in stockbased compensation these increases in cash flows from operations were offset in part by the effects of a 12 million change in deferred income taxes a 130 million change in the excess tax benefits relating to stock based compensation and a 17 million decrease in amortization of intangible assets 

  

we used 1658 million of cash and cash equivalents for investing activities during fiscal 2007 this compares to net cash outflow of 676 million and 683 million during fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively the 982 million increase in cash used for investing activities as compared to fiscal 2006 was due primarily to an additional 778 million of cash used for acquisitions of businesses also contributing to the increase in cash used for investing activities in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was an additional 106 million of cash used for purchases of property and equipment and a 109 million increase in miscellaneous noncurrent assets we used 887 million of cash for acquisitions of businesses during fiscal 2007 included in this amount is cash used to complete the acquisitions of edwards  kelcey wh linder  associates inc and john f brown also included in this amount is cash used to acquire all of the minority interest of jacobs engineering india pvt ltd 

our financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 203 million during fiscal 2007 this compares to net cash inflows of 483 million and 607 million during fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively the 686 million decrease in cash flows from financing activities during fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was due primarily to a more aggressive strategy in fiscal 2007 of payingdown debt which resulted in an additional use of cash of 462 million in fiscal 2007 as compared to last year also contributing to the increase in cash used for financing activities was a 407 million change in other deferred liability accounts relating primarily to accrued pension liabilities these uses of cash were offset in part by a 130 million increase in the excess tax benefits relating to stock based compensation and a 53 million increase in cash from issuances of common stock through our stock option and stockpurchase plans 

we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future we had 6134 million in cash and cash equivalents at september 30 2007 compared to 4341 million at september 30 2006 our consolidated working capital position at september 30 2007 was 10 billion compared to 7768 million at september 30 2006 we have a longterm unsecured revolving credit facility providing up to 2900 million of debt capacity under which only 405 million was utilized at september 30 2007 in the form of direct borrowings we believe that the capacity terms and conditions of our longterm revolving credit facility is adequate for our working capital and general business requirements 

new accounting pronouncements 

in addition to sfas 158 and fin 48 discussed above readers of this mda should be aware of the following new accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157— fair value measurements  sfas 157 provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable sfas 157 also requires expanded disclosures to provide information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measures on earnings sfas 157 is effective for the company’s 2009 fiscal year although early adoption is permitted the company is currently assessing the potential effect of sfas 157 on its financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk in the normal course of business our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

our only source for longterm credit is a 2900 million syndicated revolving credit facility the total amount outstanding under this facility at september 30 2007 was 405 million this agreement expires in may 2012 and provides for both fixedrate and variablerate borrowings our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall 

  

borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we continuously monitor changes in interest rates and use cash provided from operations to repay our borrowings as quickly as possible furthermore the company can use a combination of both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk 

foreign currency risk 

in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency we attempt to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs in those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies we follow the provisions of sfas no 133— accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities in accounting for our derivative contracts at september 30 2007 we had the following derivative contracts outstanding “usd” refers to us dollar “gbp” the british pound “bhd” the bahraini dinar 

 

 concurrent with the acquisition of the babtie group we entered into a forward contract with a large us bank the purpose of the contract is to hedge the company’s exposure to fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on a £399 million intercompany loan between jacobs and one of its subsidiaries based on the terms of the contract we believe the effect of the loan on future earnings at september 30 2007 should be limited to 27 million of expense at september 30 2007 the notional amount of the contract was £399 million it provides for an average exchange rate of 05828 gbpto usd and terminates in fiscal 2011 this derivative qualifies as a cash flow hedge under the provisions of sfas 133

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

the company’s management with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined by rule 13a15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of september 30 2007 the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k the “evaluation date” based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the evaluation date 

  

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act management with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the evaluation date based on the framework established in “ internal control—integrated framework”  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management has concluded that the internal controls of the company over its financial reporting as of the evaluation date were effective the company’s independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an attestation report on the company’s internal control over financial reporting which appears later in this form 10k 

changes in internal control 

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the company’s fourth quarter ended september 30 2007 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

limitations on effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its system of internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed or operated can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of internal control are met the design of the company’s control system reflects the fact that there are resource constraints and that the benefits of such control system must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control failures and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the intentional acts of individuals by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that the design of any particular control will always succeed in achieving its objective under all potential future conditions

 item 1 business tableend   

general 

we are one of the largest professional services firms in the united states our business focuses exclusively on providing a broad range of technical professional and construction services to a large number of industrial commercial and governmental clients around the world we provide project services which include engineering design architectural and similar services process scientific and systems consulting services operations and maintenance services and construction services which include directhire construction and construction management services we provide our services through offices and subsidiaries located principally in north america europe asia scandinavia and australia 

  

we concentrate our services on selected industry groups and markets including oil and gas exploration production and refining programs for various federal governments pharmaceuticals and biotechnology chemicals and polymers buildings which includes projects in the fields of health care and education as well as civic governmental and other buildings infrastructure technology and manufacturing and pulp and paper among others 

  

jacobs engineering group inc was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware on january 8 1987 on march 4 1987 it succeeded by merger to the business and assets of jacobs engineering group inc a california corporation that in 1974 had succeeded to a business organized originally by our founder dr joseph j jacobs in 1947 unless the context otherwise requires all references herein to “jacobs” or the “registrant” are to jacobs engineering group inc and its predecessors and references to the “company” “we” “us” or “our” are to both jacobs engineering group inc and its consolidated subsidiaries our common stock has been publicly held since 1970 and is currently listed on the new york stock exchange 

  

business strategy 

  

general 

there are four major components of our business strategy a relationshipbased approach to client interactions safety a strong focus on cost control and an organizational structure that facilitates efficient project management and execution acquisitions play an important role in our business strategy as they allow us to expand on existing client relationships as well as develop new ones acquisitions also allow us the opportunity to leverage our cost structure across geographic areas 

  

page 2 

relationshipbased business model 

our relationshipbased business model is central to our sustained growth and profitability we aggressively pursue the development of longterm affiliations and alliances with our clients by working 

as a partner with our clients on their capital programs we increase our understanding of their overall business needs as well as the unique technical requirements of their projects this allows us the opportunity to provide a greater range of services to our clients we market all of our services to clients in connection with their projects where the scope of work required is within our expertise by integrating and bundling our services ie providing design engineering and construction services on the same project we can price contracts more competitively and enhance overall profitability while delivering superior value to our clients our relationshipbased business model also helps us more fully understand the risks inherent in the projects which in turn allows us to better manage those risks our approach also provides us with opportunities to market those services our clients will need in the post startup and commissioning phases of a plant such as operations and maintenance services this model however does not preclude us from undertaking discrete projects that do not significantly conflict with our business strategy we will accept and perform discrete projects for our clients if we can negotiate acceptable pricing and other contract terms and conditions 

  

  

safety 

key to the success of our business strategy is our uncompromising focus on safety maintaining safe work environments has long been a mutual and unequivocal condition of the relationship we have with our employees it is also a paramount issue in our dealings with our clients and our safety program is a fundamental element of our overall approach to risk management a safe work environment is critical to our longterm success and growth we maintain a centralized quality and safety group to help ensure that the services we provide are delivered safely and in accordance with standard work processes unsafe job sites and office environments increase employee turnover increase the cost of a project to our clients expose us to types and levels of risk that are fundamentally unacceptable and raise our operating costs as well safe job sites and office environments on the other hand benefit our clients promote employee morale and enhance the longterm relationships we have with our clients employees and business partners 

  

cost control 

another important component of our business strategy is our continual emphasis on cost control as the global economy expands and companies providing technical professional and construction services are required to compete against each other across geographic boundaries the company that can provide its clients with cost efficient solutions to their project needs has the advantage our attention to cost control throughout every level of our organization allows us to deliver superior technical professional and construction services safely efficiently and within the cost and time parameters our clients require 

  

organizational structure 

our organizational structure and integrated system for delivering our services is another key component of our business strategy our operating units generally use a matrix organizational structure whereby our project management functions are supported by the various technical engineering design and construction disciplines that are necessary to effectively execute longterm engineering and construction contracts crucial functions such as project controls and procurement are local to each of our major offices and serve operations by providing specialized services required by projects in addition we actively employ a boundaryless approach to the way we serve our clients our operating groups do not compete against each other for contracts rather our organizational structure encourages our operating groups to work cohesively while simultaneously helping to reduce costs and promote an efficient delivery system for all of our services our multidomestic geographic 

  

page 3 

strategy supports our approach by allowing each office to compete in the local market place while supporting the needs of global clients in conjunction with our global network of offices 

  

the role of acquisitions in our business strategy 

our relationshipbased business model is a significant driver of our acquisition strategy when we review potential acquisition targets we are conscious of the effect the acquisition may have on our client base we favor acquisitions that allow us to expand or enhance the range of services we provide our clients andor gain access to new geographic areas in which our clients either already operate or plan to expand by expanding into new geographic areas and adding to our existing technical and project management capabilities we strive to position ourselves as a preferred singlesource provider of technical professional and construction services to our major clients the following is a brief description of some of our key mergers and acquisitions over the past five years 

  

   

   

   

   

services provided 

our business is to provide technical professional and construction services the services we provide generally fall into four broad categories project services which includes engineering design 

  

page 4 

architectural and similar services construction services operations and maintenance services and process scientific and systems consulting services the scope of services we can provide our clients therefore ranges from consulting and conceptual design services which clients often require in the very early stages of a project to complete singleresponsibility designbuildoperate contracts 

  

the following table sets forth our revenues from each of our four service categories for each of the five fiscal years ended september 30 in thousands of dollars 

  

   

certain amounts for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 

  

project services 

we employ all of the engineering design architectural and related disciplines necessary to design and engineer modern process plants including projects for clients in the chemicals and polymers pharmaceuticals and biotechnology oil  gas refining food and consumer products and basic resources industries buildings including facilities in the health care education and criminal justice markets as well as other buildings for clients in the private sector infrastructure projects including highways roads bridges and other transportation systems and wastewater treatment and similar facilities technology and manufacturing facilities for clients in the aerospace automotive defense semiconductor and electronics industries pulp and paper plants and other facilities we also employ many of the requisite scientific technical and program management capabilities necessary to provide program integration testing and evaluation services for clients in the defense and aerospace industries for the united states department of defense dod in support of information systems for weapons acquisition centers and for various agencies of the united states federal government in support of environmental programs 

  

we are capable of providing our clients with a variety of value engineering services including “safety in design” through safety in design we integrate best practices hazard analysis and risk assessment methods early in the design phase of projects taking those steps necessary to eliminate or mitigate injury and damage during the construction startup testing and commissioning and operations phases of a project 

  

in the area of construction management we provide our clients with a wide range of services as an agent for our clients we may act as the program director whereby we oversee on the owner’s behalf the complete planning design and construction phases of the project alternatively our services may be limited to providing construction consulting 

  

also included in the category of “project services” are construction related services such as cost engineering planning scheduling procurement estimating project accounting and quality and safety necessary to support our engineering design construction construction and program management operations and maintenance and consulting services 

  

page 5 

construction 

we provide traditional field construction services to private and public sector clients in virtually all of the industries to which we provide project services in the area of environmental remediation and 

restoration we provide environmental remedial construction services for a variety of public and private sector clients we also provide many of our clients with modular construction technology our modular construction technology is an advanced form of offsite engineering and design fabrication assembly and field erection a modular approach provides clients with an alternative approach to traditional methods of engineering and construction which can compress and shorten the construction schedule 

  

historically our field construction activities have focused primarily on those construction projects for which we perform much of the related engineering and design work by focusing our construction efforts on such projects we minimize the risks associated with constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared by third parties the financial risk to us of constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared by third parties may be particularly significant on fixedprice contracts therefore we generally avoid this type of project however we continue to pursue constructiononly projects where we can negotiate pricing and other acceptable contract terms 

  

operations and maintenance “om” 

om generally refers to all of the tasks required to operate and maintain large complex facilities on behalf of clients in such situations we can provide key management and support services over all of the facility’s operations including subcontractors and other onsite personnel within the environmental area om often includes engineering and technical support services as well as program management services necessary to remediate contaminated sites within the aerospace and defense areas om often requires us to provide the management and technical support services necessary to operate and maintain engine test facilities weapons integration and hightech simulation and verification centers such om contracts also frequently require us to provide facilities management and maintenance services utilities operations and maintenance services property management and disposition service and construction support services 

  

this category also includes plant maintenance services which generally involves the tasks required to keep a process plant typically a refinery or chemical plant in daytoday operation this would include the repair and replacement of pumps piping heat exchangers and other equipment as well as “turnaround” work which involves major refurbishment that can only be performed when the plant is shut down since shutdowns are expensive to the owners of the plant turnaround work often requires maximizing the number of skilled craft personnel that can work efficiently on a project on a 24hoursperday sevendaysperweek basis we use sophisticated computer scheduling and programming to complete turnaround projects quickly and we maintain contact with a large pool of skilled craft personnel we can hire as needed on maintenance and turnaround projects 

  

although the gross profit margins that we realize from om services are generally lower than those associated with the other services we provide the costs to support maintenance activities are also generally lower furthermore we view om contracts as presenting a lower financial risk to the company as compared to some of the other services we provides because om contracts are normally costreimbursable in nature additionally although engineering and construction projects may be of a shortterm nature om services often result in longterm relationships with clients for example we have been providing maintenance services at several major process plants for over 30 years this aspect of maintenance services greatly reduces the selling costs in respect of such services 

  

process scientific and systems consulting 

we employ all of the professional and technical expertise necessary to provide a broad range of consulting services including performing pricing studies market analyses and financial projections 

  

page 6 

necessary in determining the feasibility of a project performing gasoline reformulation modeling analyzing and evaluating layout and mechanical designs for complex processing plants analyzing automation and control systems analyzing designing and executing biocontainment strategies developing and performing process protocols with respect to federal drug administrationmandated qualification and validation requirements providing consultation on proposed railway and airport expansion projects and performing geological and metallurgical studies 

  

also included in the category of “process scientific and systems consulting” are the professional and program management services required to assist clients such as the united states federal government and its agencies in a wide range of defense and aerospace related programs such services typically are more technical and scientific in nature than are other project services we provide and may involve such tasks as supporting the development and testing of conventional weapons systems weapons modeling and simulations computer systems development maintenance and support evaluation and testing of missioncritical control systems and other highly technical programs and tasks 

  

complementary nature of resources and business systems utilized 

there is a high degree of similarity of the workforces among our service categories for example engineering and design services ie services provided by persons who are degreed and in certain circumstances licensed such as engineers architects scientists and economists exist in all four service categories in addition there is a high degree of similarity among a significant component of the workforces we employ to perform on om and construction projects in providing om and construction services we employ a large number of skilled craft labor personnel these may include welders pipe fitters electricians crane operators and other personnel that work on very large capital projects in the case of projects classified within the construction services category or on smaller capital projects in the case of maintenance projects classified within the om services category 

  

our operating units use a matrix organizational structure our results therefore are dependent on groups representing technical disciplines eg electrical engineering mechanical engineering cost engineering etc supporting project management personnel who maintain the relationship between us and our clients and who are ultimately responsible for delivering projects to our clients safely on time and on budget additionally all of our operating regions and divisions use common tools policies and procedures to manage and run their respective businesses these include practices concerning such things as project review meetings project performance evaluations and project execution plans 

  

the use of technology throughout our organization is highly uniform whether it is pcbased computer aided design and drafting cadd applications used by our engineering and design staff or pcbased modeling programs used by the scientific and consulting staff or pcbased scheduling estimating and cost control applications used by homeoffice personnel in support of our construction and maintenance activities all of the service categories described above are equally vulnerable to changes in technology as they occur in the economy at large 

  

industry groups and markets 

we provide our services to clients that operate in the following industry groups and markets oil and gas exploration production and refining longterm programs for various national governments including the united states chemicals and polymers pharmaceuticals and biotechnology infrastructure buildings technology and manufacturing and pulp and paper we also provide services to clients operating in certain other industries and markets such as food and consumer products and basic resources eg mining minerals and fertilizers among others we believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit crossutilization of our resources and help to mitigate the negative effects of a downturn in a single industry 

  

page 7 

the following table sets forth our revenues from each of the various industry groups and markets in which our clients operate for each of the five fiscal years ended september 30 in thousands of dollars 

  

   

oil  gas and refining 

  

we provide our full line of traditional engineering design construction and construction management services to our clients operating in the areas of exploration production and refining typical projects include new design and construction revamps or expansions of existing plants upgrades of individual process units within refineries and maintenance services we also provide a broad range of consulting services to our clients including process assessments facility appraisals feasibility studies technology evaluations project finance structuring and support and multiclient studies and subscription services 

  

historically revenues from our hydrocarbon business related primarily to projects associated with petroleum refining and the processes and technologies required to convert crude oil and gas into petroleum fuels chemical feedstocks and lubricants more recently our services and the types of projects we perform have expanded to include the upstream and downstream sectors of the oil and gas industry these projects include heavy oil processing projects eg oil sands extraction projects projects involving oil recovery through steam injection and natural gas treating gathering and storage projects including extraction of commercially valuable elements of the gas stream a new area of focus for us is offshore production where we are actively pursuing project opportunities in engineering and design of topside facilities higher energy prices and the depletion of traditional reserves are driving our clients towards the development of new reserves and the expansion of existing ones we are actively supporting our clients in these initiatives in north america the middle east and asia 

  

government regulations continue to influence the need for project services by our clients operating in the refining industry we see continuing project activity in refining due to tier ii gasoline and onroad ultra low sulfur diesel requirements we believe new regulations such as offroad ultra low sulfur diesel and new ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulates will drive new investment requirements in the industry over the next several years we are actively involved in such regulatorybased projects we believe we are uniquely positioned in this field through our proprietary sulfur removal technology super claus which has a strong share of the market for installed capacity biofuels and particularly biodiesel is another area of increasing activity and opportunity we are already working on a number of these projects in europe 

  

refineries are also responding to changes in feedstock price and availability as well as the product market this is leading to investment to facilitate processing heavier crude with higher sulfur content 

  

page 8 

and producing a different product slate responding to increased demand for diesel our north american and european offices are very involved in this market 

  

we have also used our modular construction technology on a number of projects in the refining and petroleum industry in the us and european refining markets many projects involve revamping existing processing units or adding new processes to an existing refinery as a result of the close proximity of processing units in these refineries we believe using modular construction can decrease congestion at the construction site modular construction can also provide cost and project execution benefits in remote locations 

  

we also provide maintenance services to our clients in the refining industry and have established a number of formal alliances with various clients some of these alliances are both national within the us and international in scope 

  

in this industry group and market we also include power generation and cogeneration projects while not a major focus for us we provide design engineering procurement construction and construction management and maintenance services to our clients in the power generation and supply industry typical projects include simple and combined cycle power projects cogeneration power plants aeroderivative and industrial gas turbines and emergency power generation stations the industry is now focusing on gasification as high energy prices the need for hydrogen and power availability of lower priced solid fuels and the potential to sequester co 2 emissions make this technology a new area for project development 

  

national government programs 

we categorize our national government programs as generally relating to environmental aerospace and defense or building programs 

  

environmental programs

backlog 

for information regarding our backlog refer to item 7— management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  below 

  

significant customers 

for the fiscal years ended september 30 2006 2005 2004 2003 and 2002 revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the united states federal government accounted for 164 212 223 226 and 215 respectively of total revenues it is rare when a commercial customer contributes 10 or more of the company’s total revenue on occasion we can execute a number of field services projects which include a significant amount of passthrough costs for a single customer where revenues from that customer exceed 10 of total revenue for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 revenues earned from valero energy corporation accounted for 102 of total company revenues revenues earned from this customer in prior fiscal years constituted less than 10 of total revenues 

  

financial information about geographic areas 

the financial information regarding geographic areas in which we operate is included in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f1 of this annual report on form 10k and is incorporated herein by reference 

  

contracts 

while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake our contracts generally fall into three broad categories costreimbursable fixedprice and guaranteed maximum price the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts during each of the five preceding fiscal years ended september 30 

  

   

in accordance with industry practice most of our contracts are subject to termination at the discretion of the client contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination 

  

when we are directly responsible for engineering design procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client’s plant or facility we reflect the costs of materials equipment and subcontracts in both revenues and costs on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not 

  

page 15 

reflected in either revenues or costs the following table presents the approximate amount of such 

passthrough costs included in revenues for each of the five preceding fiscal years ended september 30 in millions 

  

   

costreimbursable contracts 

costreimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit the profit element may be in the form of a simple markup applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee or a combination of a markup and a fee the fee element can also take several forms the fee may be a fixed amount as specified in the contract it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred or it may be an incentive fee based on targets milestones or performance factors defined in the contract in general we prefer costreimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price 

  

fixedprice contracts 

fixedprice contracts include both “lump sum bid” contracts and “negotiated fixedprice” contracts under lump sum bid contracts we are required to bid against other contractors based on specifications the client furnishes this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period additionally it is not unusual for lump sum bid contracts to lead to an adversarial relationship with clients which is contrary to our relationshipbased business model accordingly lump sum bid contracts are not our preferred form of contract under a negotiated fixedprice contract we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client negotiated fixedprice contracts frequently exist in singleresponsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project thus although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us however because of economies that may be realized during the contract term both negotiated fixedprice and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than other types of contracts over the past five years most of our fixedprice work has been either negotiated fixedprice contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services rather than turnkey construction 

  

guaranteed maximum price contracts 

guaranteed maximum price contracts are performed in the same manner as costreimbursable contracts however the total actual cost plus the fee cannot exceed the guaranteed price negotiated with the client if the total actual cost of the contract exceeds the guaranteed maximum price then we will bear at least some if not all of the excess in those cases where the total actual cost and fee are less than the guaranteed price we will often share the savings on a predetermined basis with the client these contracts are not our preferred form of contract because they often contribute to an adversarial relationship with clients which is contrary to our relationshipbased business model

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

we engage in a highly competitive business increased competition for professional services could reduce our market share and profits 

there is intense competition to provide professional engineering design architectural program management systems consulting construction and construction management services the extent of our competition varies according to the industries and markets we serve as well as the geographic areas in which we operate the degree and type of competition we face in the marketplace is also often influenced by the type and scope of projects for which we compete for example with respect to our construction and operations and maintenance services clients generally award large projects eg large designbuild and program management projects to large contractors some of our competitors are larger than us and may possess greater resources than we do which may give them an advantage when bidding for certain of these large projects conversely the relatively small amount of capital required for a business providing engineering design architectural and consulting services creates a relative ease of market entry for a new entrant possessing acceptable professional qualifications and certifications accordingly our competitors range from small regional firms to large national and international organizations if we are unable to compete effectively in the geographic areas in which we operate we may experience a loss of market share and reduced profitability 

  

our larger competitors for engineering construction and maintenance services for process plants include the bechtel group inc fluor corporation foster wheeler corp washington group international kellogg brown  root aker kvaerner technip and amec plc in the area of buildings our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr inc hellmuth obata  kassabaum aecom technology turner construction and day  zimmermann in the area of infrastructure our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as parsons brinckerhoff urs corporation hntb and ws atkins in the area of us federal programs our principal competitors include several of the companies listed above as well as the shaw group saic ch2m hill weston solutions lockheed martin corporation tetra tech and computer sciences corporation and in the area of pulp and paper our principal competitors include bek and amec plc 

  

our continued success is dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel 

there is intense demand for employees able to perform the services we provide the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain personnel including engineers architects designers and corporate management professionals who have the necessary and required experience and expertise in addition there is significant demand for qualified craft personnel in the geographic areas where our construction and maintenance sites are located in certain geographic 

  

page 17 

areas we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel if we cannot find and retain highly qualified and trained engineers architects designers and corporate management employees or hire skilled craft personnel as needed it could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 

  

the contracts in our backlog may be adjusted cancelled or suspended by our clients additionally even if fully performed our backlog is not a good indicator of our future gross margins or gross profits 

at september 30 2006 our backlog totaled approximately 98 billion in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client in addition our backlog is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as adjustments to the costs relating to the contracts accordingly we cannot guarantee that the amount of backlog inhand at september 30 2006 will actually be realized as revenues 

  

the gross margins ie contract revenue less direct costs of contracts can vary considerably between contracts one aspect of our business that can have a significant effect on the gross margins we realize on our contracts and projects is the amount of passthrough costs incurred when we are directly responsible for engineering design procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client’s plant or facility we reflect the costs of materials equipment and subcontracts in both revenues and costs on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs since passthrough costs typically do not bring significant margins with them it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in revenues without experiencing a corresponding change in our gross margins 

  

additionally the way we perform on our individual contracts can affect greatly our gross margins and hence future profitability in some of the markets we serve there is an increasing trend towards cost–reimbursable contracts with incentivefee arrangements typically our incentive fees are based on such things as achievement of target completion dates or target costs overall safety performance overall client satisfaction andor other performance criteria if we subsequently fail to meet such targets or achieve the expected performance standards we may receive a lower or even zero incentive fee resulting in lower gross margins accordingly there is no guarantee that the contracts in backlog assuming they produce the revenues currently expected will generate gross margins at the rates we have realized in the past 

  

contracts with the us federal government and other governments and their agencies pose additional risk relating to future funding and compliance 

contracts with the us and other governments and their agencies are subject to various uncertainties restrictions and regulations including oversight audits by various government authorities and profit and cost controls in the us government contracts are also exposed to uncertainties associated with congressional funding the us federal government is under no obligation to maintain funding at any specific level and funds for a program may even be eliminated 

  

in addition us government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of other socioeconomic requirements for example we must comply with the federal acquisition regulation the truth in negotiations act the cost accounting standards the service contract act and department of defense security regulations we must also comply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutes related to employment practices environmental protection recordkeeping and accounting if we fail to comply with any of these regulations requirements or statutes our existing government contracts could be terminated and we could be temporarily suspended or even debarred from government contracting or subcontracting 

  

page 18 

we also run the risk of the effects of government audits investigations and proceedings and socalled “qui tam” actions brought by individuals or the government under the us federal false claims act that if an unfavorable result occurs could impact our profits and financial condition as well as our ability to obtain future government work for example government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors if these agencies determine that a rule or regulation has been violated a variety of penalties can be imposed including criminal and civil penalties all of which would harm our reputation with the government or even debar us from future government activities 

  

if one or more of our government contracts are terminated for any reason including for convenience if we are suspended from government contract work or if payment of our costs is disallowed we could suffer a significant reduction in expected revenues and profits 

  

we bear the risk of cost overruns in approximately 10 of the dollarvalue of our contracts we may experience reduced profits or in some cases losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates 

for the year ended september 30 2006 approximately 10 of our revenues was earned under contracts that were either fixedprice or guaranteed maximum price in nature for such contracts we bear the risk of paying some if not all of any cost overruns under these fixed price and guaranteed maximum price contracts contract prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates which are based on a number of assumptions including assumptions about future economic conditions prices and availability of labor equipment and materials and other exigencies if these estimates prove inaccurate or circumstances change such as unanticipated technical problems difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals changes in local laws or labor conditions weather delays cost of raw materials or our suppliers’ or subcontractors’ inability to perform cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or in some cases a loss for that project ambiguities as to contract specifications can also lead to costoverruns 

  

international operations unfavorable political developments natural disasters and weak foreign economies may seriously harm our financial condition 

for the year ended september 30 2006 approximately 35 of our revenues were earned from unaffiliated clients outside the united states our business is dependent on the continued success of our international operations and we expect that our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues at a minimum our reported financial condition and results of operations are exposed to the effects both positive and negative that fluctuating exchange rates have on the process of translating the financial statements of our international operations which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar into the us dollar in addition our international operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

page 19 

our business is dependent on the timing and funding of new awards and we are vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the markets in which are clients operate 

we provide technical professional and construction services to clients operating in a number of markets including oil and gas exploration production and refining longterm programs for various national governments including the united states chemicals and polymers pharmaceuticals and biotechnology infrastructure buildings technology and manufacturing and pulp and paper among others these individual markets are generally cyclical in nature because we are dependent on the timing and funding of new awards we are therefore vulnerable to unanticipated downturns in our clients’ markets and industries as a result our past results have varied considerably and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects in the industries listed above and the geographic regions in which we operate 

  

rising inflation interest rates andor construction costs could reduce the demand for our services as well as decrease our profit on our existing contracts in particular with respect to our fixed price contracts 

because a significant portion of our revenues is earned from costreimbursable type contracts 90 85 and 83 during fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years have been generally minor however we bear all of the risk of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are fixedprice and may be at risk to the effects of rising inflation with respect to those contracts that are guaranteed maximumprice in addition rising inflation interest rates andor construction costs could reduce the demand for our services furthermore if we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixedprice and lumpsum work is more prevalent inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future therefore increases in inflation interest rates andor construction costs could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 

  

our strategic plan relies in part on acquisitions to sustain our growth acquisitions of other companies present certain risks and uncertainties 

our strategic plan involves growth through among other things the acquisition of other companies such growth involves a number of risks including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition we cannot assure you that we will continue to locate suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us acquisitions may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced 

  

in the event we issue stock as consideration for certain acquisitions we may make we could dilute share ownership 

we grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions one method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity 

  

page 20 

securities if we do issue additional equity securities such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing stockholders’ individual ownership percentages in the company 

  

the outcome of pending and future claims and litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business 

the nature of our business results in clients subcontractors and vendors occasionally presenting claims against us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible similarly and in the normal course of business we occasionally present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible if we fail to properly document the nature of our claims or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating reasonable settlements with our clients vendors and subcontractors we could incur cost overruns and experience reduced profits or in some cases suffer a loss for that project 

  

in the normal course of business we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation generally such guarantees relate to project schedules and plant performance most of the litigation in which we are involved as a defendant relates to workers’ compensation personal injury environmental employmentlabor professional liability and other similar lawsuits we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations however we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under our insurance programs which may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured 

  

delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control 

we are a delaware corporation certain antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law impose restrictions on the ability of others to acquire control of us in addition certain provisions of our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover for example 

  

   

   

   

   

these types of provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders accordingly stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

the purpose of this management’s discussion and analysis “mda” is to provide an overview of the company’s financial condition and results of operations as well as an analysis of the factors that caused certain key elements of our financial statements to change from one year to the next 

  

in this mda we use certain terms and abbreviations that are defined as follows 

  

   

overview 

net earnings in fiscal 2006 increased by 496 as compared to last year and eps diluted grew by 460 we continued to see increased revenues from clients operating in many of the industry groups and markets we serve but in particular oil  gas and refining chemicals and polymers and pharmaceuticals and biotechnology also contributing to the increase in revenues was a 746 increase in passthrough costs when we are responsible for subcontract labor or thirdparty materials and equipment we reflect the costs of such items in both revenues and costs since passthrough costs which are incurred primarily on projects requiring field services typically do not have significant margins it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in revenues without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit 

  

our cash balances increased by 810 during fiscal 2006 cash and cash equivalents increased from 2398 million at september 30 2005 to 4341 million at september 30 2006 our “net cash” defined as cash and cash equivalents less bank debt increased from 1439 million at september 30 2005 to 3419 million at september 30 2006 additions to property and equipment used 540 million of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2006 as compared to 439 million last year our cash balances combined with a borrowing capacity of 2900 million under our longterm unsecured revolving credit facility provide sufficient capital resources for us to fund our ongoing operations 

  

critical accounting policies 

in order to understand better the changes that may occur to key elements of our financial condition and operating results a reader of this mda should endeavor to understand the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

  

page 25 

the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business entity performing longterm engineering and constructiontype contracts requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect both the entity’s results of operations as well as the carrying values of its assets and liabilities although our significant accounting polices are described in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue accounting for contracts and use of joint ventures —in accounting for longterm engineering and constructiontype contracts we follow the provisions of the aicpa’s statement of position 811 —accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts  in general we recognize revenues at the time we provide services depending on the commercial terms of the contract we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred or using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion this method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress in making such estimates judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule the cost of materials and labor and productivity and the impact of change orders liability claims contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee in some of the markets we serve there is an increasing trend towards costreimbursable contracts with incentivefee arrangements in certain instances we base our incentive fees on achievement of target completion dates target costs andor other performance criteria failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or nonrecoverable costs which could exceed revenues recognized from the project one such incentivefee contract is with the doe for the fernald closure project this contract provides for incentive fees based on schedule and cost in addition the terms of the contract stipulate that the incentive fees may not be fully billed to the doe until the completion of the project currently estimated to occur in fiscal 2007 at september 30 2006 we had recognized 400 million of deferred fees relating to this contractcompletion 

  

we provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known without regard to the percentage of completion 

  

the nature of our business sometimes results in clients subcontractors or vendors presenting claims against us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible similarly and in the normal course of business we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible in those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract we would include in the total estimated costs of the contract and therefore the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract an estimate based on all relevant facts and circumstances available of the additional costs to be incurred in those situations where we have incurred additional costs for which we believe the client is contractually responsible we may present a claim to the client for such costs in such situations we include in revenues the amount of costs incurred without profit to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims 

  

certain costreimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment in this situation revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon 

  

page 26 

completion of the contracts in those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs not allowable under the terms of the contract we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly 

  

as is common in the industry we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures for certain of these joint ventures ie where we have an undivided interest in the assets and liabilities of the venture we recognize our proportionate share of joint venture revenues costs and operating profit in our consolidated statements of earnings for other investments in engineering and construction joint ventures we use the equity method of accounting 

  

accounting for stock issued to employees and others —effective october 1 2005 we began accounting for stock issued to employees and outside directors under sfas no 123r— sharebased payment sfas 123r supersedes apb 25— accounting for stock issued to employees and requires that we measure the value of services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grantdate fair value of the award the computed fair value is recognized as a noncash cost over the period the employee provides services we adopted sfas 123r under the modified retrospective application method accordingly we have adjusted our prior financial statements to include the amounts we reported previously in the pro forma disclosures made in accordance with the provisions of sfas 123— stockbased compensation  

  

we use the blackscholes option pricing model to compute the grant date fair value of the award the blackscholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions in order to compute the hypothetical fair value of an option changes in these assumptions can cause drastically different values being assigned to a stock option the value assigned to any stock options that may be awarded in the future as well as the related expense associated with any such awards will be dependent on the assumptions used 

  

the following table compares the effects of sfas 123r on net earnings and earnings per share for the years ended september 30 2006 2005 and 2004 in thousands except pershare information 

  

   

page 27 

accounting for pension plans —in accounting for pension plans we follow the provisions of sfas no 87— employers’ accounting for pensions sfas 87 requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans’ assets and liabilities these assumptions involve discount rates investment returns and projected salary increases among others we rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in valuing the financial position of the plans and to provide advice regarding the actuarial assumptions used the expected rates of return on plan assets for fiscal 2006 ranged from 50 to 90 compared to a range of 60 to 90 last year we believe this range of rates reflects the longterm returns expected on the plans’ assets considering projected rates of inflation the diversification of the plans’ assets and the expected real rates of market returns the discount rates used to compute plan liabilities were raised from a range of 40 to 55 in fiscal 2005 to a range of 475 to 625 in fiscal 2006 changes in the actuarial assumptions may have a material affect on the plans’ assets and liabilities and the associated pension expense management together with our actuaries monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in order to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used 

  

during fiscal 2006 we reached an agreement with stork nv regarding the plan assets and liabilities relating to our employees in the netherlands who were participants of a multiemployer pension plan under the agreement stork nv has assumed the pension obligations for our employees up to february 2001 the date we acquired certain engineering and contracting businesses from stork nv a 418 million liability recorded previously in connection with the february 2001 business combination has been allocated to the various pension plans we acquired from stork nv 

  

accounting for income taxes —we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109— accounting for income taxes  and other applicable authoritative pronouncements judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the normal course of business we may engage in numerous transactions every day for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in taxable income or deducted as an expense is uncertain additionally the tax returns we file are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service most states in the united states and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the united states our effective tax rate was 355 in fiscal 2006 372 in fiscal 2005 and 353 in fiscal 2004 we routinely monitor the appropriateness of our worldwide tax rate and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates 

  

insurance matters litigation claims and contingencies —in the normal course of business we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation generally such guarantees relate to project schedules and plant performance most of the litigation in which we are concerned involves the company as a defendant in workers’ compensation personal injury environmental employmentlabor professional liability and other similar lawsuits we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations however we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under our insurance programs this situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured in addition as a contractor providing services to various agencies of the united states federal government we are subject to many levels of audits investigations and claims by or on behalf of the us federal government with respect to contract performance pricing costs cost allocations and procurement practices 

  

in accordance with sfas no 5— accounting for contingencies  we record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such claims guarantees litigation and audits and investigations we rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in determining the level of reserves to establish for insurancerelated claims that are known and have been asserted against us and for insurancerelated claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial 

  

page 28 

analysis but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates we include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations 

  

testing goodwill for impairment —in accordance with sfas no 142 —goodwill and other intangible assets  the amount of goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets is tested annually for possible impairment in conducting the impairment test we may apply in accordance with the provisions of sfas 142 various valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of our reporting units the values resulting from the application of these valuation techniques are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of our reporting units to a willing third party since the adoption of sfas 142 in fiscal 2002 we have not recorded any impairment loss associated with our goodwill 

  

foreign currencies —in general our principal exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating the financial statements of our subsidiaries operating outside the united states which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar into the us dollar we follow the provisions of sfas no 52— foreign currency translation in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

  

we believe our exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because our various operations invoice clients and satisfy their financial obligations primarily in their respective local functional currencies in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currencies we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs or when appropriate enter into foreign currency hedges to limit our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 

  

results of operations 

  

general 

our business focuses exclusively on providing technical professional and construction services to a large number of industrial commercial and governmental clients around the world the services we provide generally fall into four broad categories 

  

   

   

   

   

the scope of services we can provide our clients therefore ranges from consulting and conceptual design services which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project to complete singleresponsibility designbuildoperate contracts 

  

page 29 

the following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each year ended september 30 in thousands 

  

   

we focus our services on clients operating in certain industry groups and markets we believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit crossutilization of our resources the following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each year ended september 30 in thousands 

  

   

“other” includes projects for clients operating in food and consumer products and basic resources such as mining minerals and fertilizers industry groups and markets 

  

fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

we recorded net earnings of 1969 million or 327 per diluted share for fiscal year ended september 30 2006 compared to net earnings of 1316 million or 224 per diluted share for fiscal 2005 

  

total revenues for fiscal 2006 increased by 18 billion or 317 to 74 billion compared to total revenues of 56 billion for fiscal 2005 revenues increased among most of the industry groups and markets we serve lead by a 524 increase in revenues from clients operating in the chemicals and polymers markets and a 432 increase in revenues from clients operating in the oil  gas and refining industries the increase in revenues from clients operating in the chemicals and polymers markets was driven by demand by a number of our clients to increase capacity the increase in revenues from our clients operating in the oil  gas and refining industries was due primarily to new and continuing projects reconfiguring existing refineries in order to increase production and address the effects of changing crude inputs – from lighter crudes to heavier crudes that contain slightly higher levels of sulfur although we continued to perform on contracts relating to various clean fuels programs during fiscal 2006 we saw that spending levels for these programs started to wane 

  

also contributing to the increase in revenues were new awards in the upstream area of this market relating to oil sands extraction projects also contributing to the increase in revenues was a 11452 million increase in passthrough costs when we are responsible for subcontract labor or 

  

page 30 

thirdparty materials and equipment we reflect the costs of such items in both revenues and costs the level of passthrough costs included in revenues and costs will vary between reporting periods depending principally on the amount of procurement that clients choose to do themselves as opposed to using our services as well as on the normal winding down of field services activities on construction and om projects 

  

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts were 874 for fiscal 2006 compared to 857 for fiscal 2005 the percentage relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided the increase in direct costs of contracts as a percentage of revenues was due to the increase in passthrough costs combined with slightly lower fees from our engineering services offset in part by slightly higher fees from field services since passthrough costs which are incurred primarily on projects requiring field services typically do not generate significant margins it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in revenues without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit 

  

we were successful in keeping sga growth inline with our increased business activity during fiscal 2006 sga expenses during fiscal 2006 increased by 413 million or 70 to 6327 million compared to 5914 million during fiscal 2005 contributing to the increase in sga expenses was increased professional technical services activity and the effects of foreign currency translation sga expense as a percentage of revenue decreased from 105 in fiscal 2005 to 85 in fiscal 2006 sga expense as a percentage of gross margin decreased from 733 in fiscal 2005 to 677 in fiscal 2006 contributing to the decrease in these relationships is the result of increased field services activity which generally requires less sga expense to support 

  

operating profit for fiscal 2006 increased by 867 million or 403 to 3016 million compared to 2149 million during fiscal 2005 the increase in operating profit during fiscal 2006 as compared to last year was due to the overall increase in business activity as a percentage of revenues operating profit was 41 for fiscal 2006 compared to 38 in fiscal 2005 notwithstanding the increase in the direct costs of contracts as a percentage of revenue the company was able to increase its operating profit by limiting the increase in sga expenses 

  

interest income increased by 109 million to 152 million during fiscal 2006 compared to 43 million of interest income during fiscal 2005 included in interest income for fiscal 2006 is 33 million relating to the favorable settlement of a matter with the us internal revenue service “irs” the balance of the increase in interest income was a result of higher cash balances on deposit during fiscal 2006 as compared to last year interest expense increased by 10 million to 75 million during fiscal 2006 compared to 65 million of interest expense during fiscal 2005 the increase in interest expense is due primarily to higher levels of borrowing by our operations outside the us in support of the growth in business combined with slightly higher interest rates 

  

we recorded income tax expense of 1084 million during fiscal 2006 compared to 779 million during fiscal 2005 our overall effective tax rate was 355 during fiscal 2006 compared to 372 last year the overall effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was impacted by the favorable settlement of a matter with the irs offset in part by provisions recorded for certain other income tax exposures the net effect of the irs settlement and the other income tax exposures was a net reduction to the company’s income tax expense of 15 million impacting the overall effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 was certain stockbased compensation expense amounts relating to the company’s employee stock purchase plans where no tax benefit was available to the company in the normal course of our business we may engage in numerous transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in income or deducted as an expense is uncertain 

  

page 31 

additionally we file income franchise gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service most states in the united states and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the united states we continually monitor the appropriateness of the rate and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates 

  

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 

we recorded net earnings of 1316 million or 224 per diluted share for fiscal year ended september 30 2005 compared to net earnings of 1156 million or 201 per diluted share for fiscal 2004 

  

total revenues for fiscal 2005 increased by 10 billion or 227 to 56 billion compared to total revenues of 46 billion for fiscal 2004 revenues increased among most of the industry groups and markets we serve lead by a 541 increase in revenues from clients operating in the oil  gas and refining industries and a 523 increase in revenues from clients operating in the infrastructure market the increase in revenues from our clients operating in the oil  gas and refining industries was due primarily to continuing projects we’re executing in the area of clean fuels combined with new awards of projects assisting refiners improve and enhance capacity also contributing to the increase in revenues were new awards in the upstream area of this market relating to oil sands extraction projects the increase in revenues from clients operating in the infrastructure market was due primarily to the inclusion of the babtie group for all of fiscal 2005 the babtie group contributed approximately 3241 million of revenue during fiscal 2005 compared to approximately 540 million during fiscal 2004 the babtie group was acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 also contributing to the increase in revenues was a 3698 million increase in passthrough costs 

  

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts were 857 for fiscal 2005 compared to 855 for fiscal 2004 the increase in direct costs of contracts as a percentage of revenues was due to the increase in passthrough costs offset in part by the inclusion of the babtie group for all of fiscal 2005 whose revenues are weighted towards project services 

  

sga expenses during fiscal 2005 increased by 1053 million or 217 to 5914 million compared to 4861 million during fiscal 2004 contributing to the increase in sga expenses during fiscal 2005 was the inclusion of the babtie group for the entire year the babtie group contributed approximately 896 million of sga expenses during fiscal 2005 versus approximately 135 million of sga expenses during fiscal 2004 the balance of the increase was due primarily to the effects of foreign currency translation and higher spending in support of our professional technical services activities 

  

operating profit for fiscal 2005 increased by 363 million or 204 to 2149 million compared to 1786 million during fiscal 2004 the increase in operating profit during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was due to the overall increase in business activity as a percentage of revenues operating profit was 38 for fiscal 2005 compared to 39 for fiscal 2004 in spite of the significant increase in passthrough costs the company was able to maintain its level of operating profit by limiting the increase in sga expenses 

  

interest income increased by 13 million to 43 million during fiscal 2005 compared to 31 million of interest income during fiscal 2004 the increase in interest income was due primarily to higher cash balances on deposit during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 interest expense increased by 29 million to 65 million during fiscal 2005 compared to 36 million of interest expense during fiscal 2004 the increase in interest expense reflects the effects of the debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of the babtie group being outstanding for all of fiscal 2005 versus only a portion of fiscal 2004 

  

page 32 

we recorded income tax expense of 779 million during fiscal 2005 compared to 631 million during fiscal 2004 our overall effective tax rate was 372 for fiscal 2005 and 353 for fiscal 2004 the overall effective tax rates in 2005 and 2004 were impacted by certain stock based compensation expense amounts relating to the company’s employee stock purchase plans where no tax benefit was available to the company also affecting the increase in our overall tax rate during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was the effects of the nondeductibility for tax purposes of the amortization of intangible assets we acquired in connection with the babtie group combined with a shift in earnings among our nonus operations 

  

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth certain information about our contractual obligations as of september 30 2006 in thousands 

  

    

   

   

   

backlog 

the following table summarizes our backlog at september 30 2006 2005 and 2004 in millions 

  

   

because the entire value of contracts is added to backlog as soon as the contracts are awarded to us rather than adding the contracts to backlog gradually over time and many of our contracts require 

  

page 33 

us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years we evaluate our backlog on a yearoveryear basis rather than on a sequential quarteroverquarter basis our backlog at september 30 2006 increased by 11 billion or 131 to 98 billion from 86 billion at september 30 2005 the increase in backlog during fiscal 2006 was attributable primarily to new awards from clients operating within the oil  gas and the chemical and polymer industry groups and markets 

  

in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client however we have not experienced cancellations that have had a material effect on the reported backlog amounts in a situation where a client terminates a contract we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and in certain instances we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein 

  

total backlog at september 30 2006 included approximately 22 billion or 223 of total backlog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies this compares to approximately 22 billion or 253 of total backlog and 23 billion or 302 of total backlog of us federal backlog at september 30 2005 and 2004 respectively most of our federal contracts require that services be provided beyond one year in general these contracts must be funded annually ie the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the us congress to the procuring agency and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts 

  

subject to the factors discussed in item 1a— risk factors  above we estimate that approximately 64 billion or 651 of total backlog at september 30 2006 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year 

  

effects of inflation 

refer to item 1a— risk factors  above 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our operations primarily through cash provided by operations at september 30 2006 our principal source of liquidity consisted of 4341 million of cash and cash equivalents and 2123 million of available capacity under our 2900 million unsecured revolving credit facility discussed below 

  

during fiscal 2006 our cash and cash equivalents increased by 1942 million to 4341 million this compares to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of 1398 million during fiscal 2005 and a decrease of 261 million during fiscal 2004 during fiscal 2006 we experienced net cash inflows from operating activities and financing activities of 2235 million and 483 million respectively these inflows were offset in part by net cash outflows from investing activities and the effect of exchange rate changes of 676 million and 101 million respectively 

  

our operations provided net cash of 2235 million during fiscal 2006 this compares to net cash inflows of 1503 million and 868 million during fiscal 2005 and 2004 respectively the 732 million increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was due primarily to a 653 million increase in net earnings a 104 million increase relating to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts a 75 million change in deferred income taxes and an increase of 19 million in depreciation and amortization of property equipment and improvements 

  

page 34 

a noncash expense these increases in cash flows from operations were offset in part by a decrease 

in certain noncash items including a 107 million decrease in stockbased compensation and a 08 million change in the excess tax benefits relating to stock based compensation 

  

we used 676 million of cash and cash equivalents for investing activities during fiscal 2006 virtually unchanged from the 683 million of cash and cash equivalents used last year although 271 million less cash was used during fiscal 2006 relating to miscellaneous noncurrent assets as compared to last year this reduction was almost entirely offset by a 101 million increase in purchases of property and equipment and an 110 million increase in cash used to acquire businesses we used 2031 million of cash and cash equivalents for investing activities during fiscal 2004 approximately 135 million more than the amount used during either fiscal 2006 or 2005 the higher amount of cash and cash equivalents used for investing activities during fiscal 2004 was due primarily to cash used in connection with the acquisition of the babtie group 

  

our financing activities resulted in net cash inflows of 483 million during fiscal 2006 this compares to net cash inflows of 607 million and 923 million during fiscal 2005 and 2004 respectively the 124 million decrease in cash flows from financing activities during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was due primarily to a 299 million increase in repayments net of borrowings under our longterm credit facilities combined with a 77 million decrease in proceeds from issuances of common stock through our stock option and stock purchase plans this reduction in cash inflows was partially offset by changes in other deferred liability accounts of 219 million relating primarily to accrued pension liabilities and an increase in short term borrowings net of repayments of 25 million 

  

we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future we had 4341 million in cash and cash equivalents at september 30 2006 compared to 2398 million at september 30 2005 our consolidated working capital position at september 30 2006 was 7768 million compared to 5523 million at september 30 2005 we have a longterm unsecured revolving credit facility providing up to 2900 million of debt capacity under which only 777 million was utilized at september 30 2006 in the form of direct borrowings we believe that the capacity terms and conditions of our longterm revolving credit facility is adequate for our working capital and general business requirements we also had at september 30 2006 360 million of borrowing capacity available to us through committed shortterm credit facilities

our only source for longterm credit is a 2900 million syndicated revolving credit facility the total amount outstanding under this facility at september 30 2006 was 777 million this agreement expires in december 2010 and provides for both fixedrate and variablerate borrowings our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we continuously monitor changes in interest rates and use cash provided from operations to repay our borrowings as quickly as possible furthermore the company can use a combination of both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk 

  

foreign currency risk 

in general our exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating the financial statements of our subsidiaries operating outside the united states which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar into the us dollar we follow the provisions of sfas no 52— foreign currency translation in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

  

we believe our exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because in general our various operations invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations in their respective local currencies in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their own functional currencies we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs or when appropriate enter into foreign currency hedges to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates at september 30 2006 the company had € 11 million approximately 140 million of forward contracts outstanding relating to such contract revenues 

  

concurrent with the acquisition of the babtie group we entered into a forward contract with a large us bank in the notional amount of £399 million then approximately 734 million the purpose of the contract is to hedge the company’s exposure to fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on a £399 million intercompany loan between jacobs and one of its subsidiaries based on the terms of the contract we believe the effect of the loan on future earnings at september 30 2006 should be limited to 34 million of expense in addition we entered into a floatingtofixed interest rate swap agreement with another us bank which fixes the effective rate of interest on certain bank debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of the babtie group at september 30 2006 the notional amount of this hedge was £201 million approximately 377 million this instrument allows us to receive a floating rate payment tied to the 3month libor plus a spread from the counterparty in exchange for a fixedrate payment from us both of the aforementioned contracts qualify as cash flow hedges under the provisions sfas no 133— accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures the company’s management with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined by rule 13a15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of september 30 2006 the end of the period covered by this annual report the “evaluation date” based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the evaluation date 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act management with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the evaluation date based on the framework established in “ internal control—integrated framework”  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management has concluded that the internal controls of the company over its financial reporting as of the evaluation date were effective 

  

changes in internal control 

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting during the company’s fourth quarter ended september 30 2006 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

  

limitations on effectiveness of controls 

the company’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its system of internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed or operated can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of internal control are met the design of the company’s control system reflects the fact that there are resource constraints and that the benefits of such control system must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control failures and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the intentional acts of individuals by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that the design of any particular control will always succeed in achieving its objective under all potential future conditions

 item 1 business 

  

general 

jacobs engineering group inc was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware on january 8 1987 on march 4 1987 it succeeded by merger to the business and assets of jacobs engineering group inc a california corporation that in 1974 had succeeded to a business organized originally by dr joseph j jacobs in 1947 unless the context otherwise requires all references herein to “jacobs” or the “registrant” are to jacobs engineering group inc and its predecessors and references to the “company” “we” “us” or “our” are to both jacobs engineering group inc and its consolidated subsidiaries the registrant’s common stock has been publicly held since 1970 and is currently listed on the new york stock exchange 

  

we are one of the largest professional services firms in the united states our business focuses exclusively on providing a broad range of technical professional and construction services to a large number of industrial commercial and governmental clients around the world we provide project services which include engineering design architectural and similar services process scientific and systems consulting services operations and maintenance services and construction services which include directhire construction and construction management services we provide our services through offices and subsidiaries located principally in north america europe asia and australia 

  

we concentrate our services on selected industry groups and markets including oil and gas exploration production and refining programs for various federal governments pharmaceuticals and biotechnology chemicals and polymers buildings which includes projects in the fields of health care and education as well as civic governmental and other buildings infrastructure technology and manufacturing and pulp and paper among others 

  

business strategy 

  

general 

there are four major components of our business strategy a relationshipbased approach to client interactions safety a strong focus on cost control and an organizational structure that facilitates efficient project management and execution 

  

relationshipbased business model 

our relationshipbased business model is central to our sustained growth and profitability we aggressively pursue the development of longterm affiliations and alliances with our clients by working as a partner with our clients on their capital programs we increase our understanding of their overall business needs as well as the unique technical requirements of their projects this allows us the opportunity to provide a greater range of services to our clients we market all of our services to clients for projects where the scope of work required is within our expertise by integrating and bundling our services ie providing design engineering and construction services on the same project we can price contracts more competitively and enhance overall profitability while delivering superior value to our clients our relationshipbased business model also helps us more fully understand the risks inherent in the projects which in turn allows us to manage those risks better our approach also provides us with opportunities to market those services our clients will need in the post startup and commissioning phases of a plant such as operations and maintenance services this model however does not preclude us from undertaking discrete projects that do not significantly conflict with our business strategy we will accept and perform discrete projects for our clients if we can negotiate acceptable pricing and other contract terms and conditions 

  

page 2 

safety 

key to the success of our business strategy is our intense and uncompromising focus on safety maintaining safe work environments has long been a mutual and unequivocal condition of the relationship we have with our employees it is also a paramount issue in our dealings with our clients and our safety program is a fundamental element of our overall approach to risk management a safe work environment is critical to our longterm success and growth we maintain a centralized quality and safety group to help ensure that the services we provide are delivered safely and in accordance with standard work processes unsafe job sites and office environments increase employee turnover increase the cost of a project to our clients expose us to types and levels of risk that are fundamentally unacceptable and raise our operating costs as well safe job sites and office environments on the other hand benefit our clients promote employee morale and enhance the longterm relationships we have with our clients employees and business partners 

  

cost control 

another important component of our business strategy is our continual emphasis on cost control as the global economy expands and companies providing technical professional and construction services are required to compete against each other across geographic boundaries the company that can provide its clients with cost efficient solutions to their project needs has the advantage our attention to cost control throughout every level of our organization allows us to deliver superior technical professional and construction services safely efficiently and within the cost and time parameters our clients require 

  

organizational structure 

our organizational structure and integrated system for delivering our services is another key component of our business strategy our operating units generally use a matrix organizational structure whereby our project management functions are supported by our various technical engineering design and construction disciplines that are necessary to effectively execute longterm engineering and construction contracts crucial functions such as project controls and procurement are local to each of our major offices and serve operations by providing specialized services required by projects in addition we actively employ a boundaryless approach to the way we serve our clients our operating groups do not compete against each other for contracts rather our organizational structure encourages our operating groups to work cohesively while simultaneously helping to reduce costs and promote an efficient delivery system for all of our services our multidomestic geographic strategy supports our approach by allowing each office to compete in the local market place while supporting the needs of global clients in partnership with our global network 

  

the role of acquisitions in our business strategy 

our relationshipbased business model is a significant driver of our acquisition strategy when we review potential acquisition targets we are conscious of the effect the acquisition may have on our client base we favor acquisitions that allow us to expand or enhance the range of services we provide our clients andor gain access to new geographic areas in which our clients either already operate or plan to expand by expanding into new geographic areas and adding to our existing technical and project management capabilities we strive to position ourselves as a preferred singlesource provider of technical professional and construction services to our major clients the following is a brief description of some of our key mergers and acquisitions over the past five years 

  

   

page 3 

   

   

   

   

services provided 

our business is to provide technical professional and construction services the services we provide generally fall into four broad categories project services which includes engineering design architectural and similar services construction services operations and maintenance services and process scientific and systems consulting services the scope of services we can provide our clients therefore ranges from consulting and conceptual design services which clients often require in the very early stages of a project to complete singleresponsibility designbuildoperate contracts 

  

the following table sets forth our revenues from each of our four service categories for each of the five fiscal years ended september 30 in thousands of dollars 

  

   

certain amounts for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 

  

page 4 

project services 

we employ all of the engineering design architectural and related disciplines necessary to design and engineer modern process plants including projects for clients in the chemicals and polymers pharmaceuticals and biotechnology oil  gas refining food and consumer products and basic resources industries buildings including facilities in the health care education and criminal justice markets as well as other buildings for clients in the private sector infrastructure projects including highways roads bridges and other transportation systems and wastewater treatment and similar facilities technology and manufacturing facilities for clients in the semiconductor electronics automotive aerospace and defense industries pulp and paper plants and other facilities we also employ many of the requisite scientific technical and program management capabilities necessary to provide program integration testing and evaluation services for clients in the defense and aerospace industries for the united states department of defense “dod” in support of information systems for weapons acquisition centers and for various agencies of the united states federal government in support of environmental programs 

  

we are capable of providing our clients with a variety of value engineering services including “safety in design” through safety in design we integrate best practices hazard analysis and risk assessment methods early in the design phase of projects taking those steps necessary to eliminate or mitigate injury and damage during the construction startup testing and commissioning and operations phases of a project 

  

in the area of construction management we provide our clients with a wide range of services as an agent for our clients we may act as the program director whereby we oversee on the owner’s behalf the complete planning design and construction phases of the project alternatively our services may be limited to providing construction consulting 

  

also included in the category of “project services” are construction related services such as cost engineering planning scheduling procurement estimating project accounting and quality and safety necessary to support our engineering design construction construction and program management operations and maintenance and consulting services 

  

construction 

we provide traditional field construction services to private and public sector clients in virtually all of the industries to which we provide project services we also provide many of our clients with modular construction technology our modular approach is an advanced form of offsite engineering and design fabrication assembly and field erection a modular approach provides clients with an alternative approach to traditional methods of engineering and construction which can compress and shorten the construction schedule in the environmental area we provide environmental remedial construction services for a variety of public and private sector clients 

  

historically our field construction activities have focused primarily on those construction projects for which we perform much of the related engineering and design work by focusing our construction efforts on such projects we minimize the risks associated with constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared by third parties the financial risk to us of constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared by third parties may be particularly significant on fixedprice contracts therefore we generally avoid this type of project however we continue to pursue constructiononly projects where we can negotiate pricing and other acceptable contract terms 

  

operations and maintenance “om” 

om generally refers to all of the tasks required to operate and maintain large complex facilities on behalf of clients in such situations we can provide key management and support services over all of the facility’s operations including subcontractors and other onsite personnel within the 

  

page 5 

environmental area om often includes engineering and technical support services as well as program management services necessary to remediate contaminated sites within the aerospace and defense areas om often requires us to provide the management and technical support services necessary to operate and maintain engine test facilities weapons integration and hightech simulation and verification centers such om contracts also frequently require us to provide facilities management and maintenance services utilities operations and maintenance services property management and disposition service and construction support services 

  

this category also includes plant maintenance services which generally involves the tasks required to keep a plant typically a refinery or chemical plant in daytoday operation this would include the repair and replacement of pumps piping heat exchangers and other equipment as well as “turnaround” work which involves major refurbishment that can only be performed when the plant is shut down since shutdowns are expensive to the owners of the plant turnaround work often requires maximizing the number of skilled craft personnel that can work efficiently on a project on a 24hoursperday sevendaysperweek basis we use sophisticated computer scheduling and programming to complete turnaround projects quickly and we maintain contact with a large pool of skilled craft personnel we can hire as needed on maintenance and turnaround projects 

  

although the gross profit margins that we realize from om services are generally lower than those associated with the other services we provide the costs to support maintenance activities are also generally lower furthermore we view om contracts as presenting a lower financial risk to the company as compared to some of the other services we provides because om contracts are normally costreimbursable in nature additionally although engineering and construction projects may be of a shortterm nature om services often result in longterm relationships with clients for example we have been providing maintenance services at several major process plants for over 30 years this aspect of maintenance services greatly reduces the selling costs in respect of such services 

  

process scientific and systems consulting 

we employ all of the professional and technical expertise necessary to provide a broad range of consulting services including performing pricing studies market analyses and financial projections necessary in determining the feasibility of a project performing gasoline reformulation modeling analyzing and evaluating layout and mechanical designs for complex processing plants analyzing automation and control systems analyzing designing and executing biocontainment strategies developing and performing process protocols with respect to federal drug administrationmandated qualification and validation requirements providing consultation on proposed railway and airport expansion projects and performing geological and metallurgical studies 

  

also included in the category of “process scientific and systems consulting” are the professional and program management services required to assist clients such as the united states federal government and its agencies in a wide range of defense and aerospace related programs such services typically are more technical and scientific in nature than are other project services we provide and may involve such tasks as supporting the development and testing of conventional weapons systems weapons modeling and simulations computer systems development maintenance and support evaluation and testing of missioncritical control systems and other highly technical programs and tasks 

  

complementary nature of resources and business systems utilized 

there is a high degree of similarity of the workforces among our service categories for example engineering and design services ie services provided by persons who are degreed and in certain circumstances licensed such as engineers architects scientists and economists exist in all four 

  

page 6 

service categories in addition there is a high degree of similarity among a significant component of the workforces we employ to perform on om and construction projects in providing om and construction services we employ a large number of skilled craft labor personnel these may include welders pipe fitters electricians crane operators and other personnel that work on very large capital projects in the case of projects classified within the construction services category or on smaller capital projects in the case of maintenance projects classified within the om services category 

  

our operating units use a matrix organizational structure our results therefore are dependent on groups representing technical disciplines eg electrical engineering mechanical engineering cost engineering etc supporting project management personnel who maintain the relationship between us and our clients and who are ultimately responsible for delivering projects to our clients safely on time and on budget additionally all of our operating regions and divisions use common tools policies and procedures to manage and run their respective businesses these include practices concerning such things as project review meetings project performance evaluations and project execution plans 

  

the use of technology throughout our organization is highly uniform whether it is pcbased computer aided design and drafting “cadd” applications used by our engineering and design staff or pcbased modeling programs used by the scientific and consulting staff or pcbased scheduling estimating and cost control applications used by homeoffice personnel in support of our construction and maintenance activities all of the service categories described above are equally vulnerable to changes in technology as they occur in the economy at large 

  

industry groups and markets 

we focus our services on clients that operate in the following industry groups and markets oil and gas exploration production and refining united states federal programs chemicals and polymers pharmaceuticals and biotechnology infrastructure buildings both public and private sector technology and manufacturing and pulp and paper we also provide services to clients in other industries and markets such as food and consumer products and basic resources eg mining minerals and fertilizers among others we believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit crossutilization of our resources and help to mitigate the negative effects of a downturn in a single industry 

  

the following table sets forth our revenues from each of these industry groups and markets for each of the five fiscal years ended september 30 in thousands of dollars 

  

   

page 7 

oil  gas and refining 

we provide our full line of traditional engineering design construction and construction management services to our clients in the upstream exploration and development and downstream production and refining areas of this market typical projects in this area include new design and construction revamps or expansions of existing plants upgrades of individual process units within refineries and maintenance services we also provide a broad range of consulting services to our clients including process assessments facility appraisals feasibility studies technology evaluations project finance structuring and support and multiclient subscription services 

  

historically revenues from our hydrocarbon business related primarily to projects associated with petroleum refining and the processes and technologies required for the conversion of crude oil and gas into petroleum fuels chemical feedstocks and lubricants more recently our services and the types of projects we perform have expanded to include the upstream and downstream sectors of the oil and gas industry these projects include heavy oil processing projects eg oil sands extraction projects projects involving oil recovery through steam injection and gas treating gas gathering and gas storage projects including extraction of commercially valuable elements of the gas stream a new area of focus is offshore production where we are actively pursuing project opportunities in engineering and design of topside facilities higher energy prices and the reduction of traditional reserves are driving the development of new reserves and the expansion of existing ones we are actively supporting our clients in these initiatives in north america the middle east and asia 

  

government regulations continue to influence the need for project services by our clients in the refining industry we see ongoing project activity in refining due to tier ii gasoline and onroad ultra low sulfur diesel requirements we believe new regulations such as offroad ultra low sulfur diesel and new ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulates will drive new investment requirements in the industry over the next several years we are actively involved in such regulatorybased projects we believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from increased capital spending in this area due to our proprietary sulphur removal technology super claus which has a significant share of the market for installed capacity 

  

refineries are also responding to changes in feedstock price and availability as well as the product market this is leading to investment to facilitate the processing of heavier crude with higher sulphur content and the production of a different product slate particularly in response to increased demand for diesel our offices in north american and europe are very involved in this market 

  

we have also used our modular construction capabilities on a number of projects in the refining and petroleum industry in the us and european refining markets many projects involve the revamp of existing processing units or the addition of new processes to an existing refinery as a result of the close proximity of processing units in these refineries we believe the use of modular construction can decrease congestion at the construction site modular construction can also provide cost and project execution benefits in remote locations 

  

we provide maintenance services to our clients in the refining industry we have also established a number of formal alliances with various clients in the refining industry some of these alliances are both domesticus and international in scope 

  

in this industry group we also include power generation and cogeneration power projects while this is not a major focus for us we provide design engineering procurement construction and construction management and maintenance services to our clients in the power generation and supply industry typical projects in this area include simple and combined cycle power projects cogeneration power plants aeroderivative and industrial gas turbines and emergency power generation stations the industry is now focusing on gasification as high energy prices the need for hydrogen and power 

  

page 8 

availability of lower priced solid fuels and the potential to sequester co² emissions make this technology a new area for project development 

  

federal programs 

we categorize our federal programs as generally relating to environmental aerospace and defense or building programs 

  

environmental 

we are one of the leading providers of environmental engineering and consulting services in the united states and abroad including hazardous and nuclear waste management and site cleanup and closure many of our projects for the united states federal government span over many years our projects within this market relate to many major federal and state environmental statutes with particular emphasis on the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act and the resource conservation and recovery act “cercla” we currently provide environmental investigation restoration engineering construction and site operations and maintenance services to a number of united states federal government agencies including the department of energy “doe” and the department of defense “dod” 

  

as part of our environmental restoration work we provide support in such areas as underground storage tank removal contaminated soil and water remediation and longterm groundwater monitoring we also design build install operate and maintain various types of soil and groundwater cleanup systems at multiple project locations across the united states and its territories for the united states army corps of engineers and the united states air force center for environmental excellence typical projects also include the preparation of feasibility studies and performance of remedial investigations engineering design and remediation services on several national programs 

  

we provide a full range of environmental consulting services including air quality planning and permitting water quality compliance environmental conservation studies pollution prevention assessments and compliance with the national environmental policy act 

  

as part of our support to our clients we provide asset management services in the form of infrastructure operations and maintenance this is an integral part of our services for the doe at the oak ridge environmental management sites and at the rocky flats environmental technology site asset management also includes building closures which involve deactivation decommissioning and demolition of government facilities we are also providing these services to the government of the united kingdom in support of its nuclear decommissioning program

also included in federal programs are revenues from projects relating to building programs we perform for certain agencies of the united states federal government we provide a wide range of architectural engineering construction and designbuild services to agencies such as the federal aviation administration “faa” the general services administration “gsa” the united states departments of state treasury agriculture and dod among others typical projects include the renovation and modernization of terminal radar control centers air traffic control towers and other facilities for the faa we also provide architectural and engineering services for the united states pentagon renovation program as well as planning and design services for internal revenue service offices and customer service centers nationwide more recent contract awards require us to provide design and program management services in connection with certain homeland security initiatives for the gsa and the department of homeland security we are providing designbuild services for the dod on military family housing quality of life projects training maintenance and readiness facilities and command and control centers 

  

chemicals and polymers 

the chemicals and polymers industries remain an important element to our overall growth this market which is on an upswing after an extended flat period continues to be an essential part of our diversified business we continue to expand our presence globally to better meet the needs of our clients as they increase their operations internationally with strong focus in the middle east and asia 

  

the types of projects we execute for our clients in these industries include feedstock synthesis chemical synthesis and polymerization this includes highpressure processes for the production of industrial chemicals and lowpressure multiproduct processes for the production of specialty and fine chemicals we have extensive knowledge of and experience with advanced polymerization reactions and stateoftheart postreactor processing techniques 

  

another important aspect of our service to clients in the chemicals and polymers business is in the area of field services we have contracts with major chemical producers worldwide to provide construction onsite maintenance and turnaround activities many of these contracts are evergreen in nature with relationships extending over many years due to our focus on safety value and client satisfaction like the refining industry we provide maintenance services to our clients in the chemicals industry we have also established formal alliances with a number of clients in this industry 

  

page 10 

our clients in this sector focus on safety reliability and maintainability to keep operating costs down to support this initiative we apply best practices on capital and maintenance work by leveraging synergy and resources within our alliances and partnerships which in one case involves more than 25 chemical facilities for one owner 

  

as these multisite relationships increase in magnitude the range of services we provide broadens other services vary from providing onsite engineering services to singlesource responsibility for an entire capital improvement program we provide technical consulting project finance structuring facility appraisal market analysis and business consulting services as well as fullyintegrated engineering procurement construction and construction management services our services can guide and assist our chemical clients from a good project idea to a constructed and operating chemical facility 

  

many of our clients currently engage in frontend feasibility planning as global industry volumes and prices strengthen in addition to large “megacapacity” projects underway in the middle east and asia we are seeing incremental capacity expansions in north america and europe a new area of focus due to high feedstock costs is gasification to produce the feeds for chemicals and fertilizers our involvement in these early studies positions us to help owners capitalize on return on investment opportunities by streamlining work processes and optimizing existing plant layouts for future expansions 

  

pharmaceuticals and biotechnology 

we furnish our full line of services to our clients in the pharmaceuticals and biotechnology industries including master planning programming feasibility studies engineering preliminary and detailed design procurement construction and construction management commissioning and startup validation and maintenance accordingly we believe we are fully capable of executing the industry’s largest capital programs on a singleresponsibility basis 

  

typical projects for clients in these industries include laboratories research and development facilities pilot plants bulk active pharmaceutical ingredient production facilities fullscale biotechnology production facilities and secondary manufacturing facilities in addition to regulatory compliance issues stateoftheart technology and expertise are critical to our clients in these industries such technology and knowledge encompasses containment barrier technology locally controlled environments process and building systems automation and offthesite design and fabrication of process and building modules 

  

as companies in the pharmaceuticals industry continue to experience pressure to decrease product timetomarket reduce costs and increase return on investment the types of services we provide have grown over the years to include modular construction as well as consulting and strategic planning services to help our clients complete capital projects more quickly and efficiently as an example of this process we increased our efforts to integrate commissioning and validation services helping reduce the amount of time required to introduce a new drug into the marketplace in the biotechnology industry our multidomestic structure helps clients as new product discovery and development drives capital spending and our ability to act as a capital program partner helps them effectively manage their strategic investment 

  

we have costeffective professional resources located in geographic areas of major pharmaceutical and biotechnology concentration and we provide singlepoint engineering procurement construction management and validation “epcmv” project delivery services we continue to enhance our 3d design capabilities project controls and automation capabilities as well as other technological aspects of our epcmv services this allows us to serve our clients better and to ensure that projects transition from their conceptual design phase through engineering construction startup commissioning and validation phases as economically and efficiently as possible

contracts 

while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake our contracts generally fall into three broad categories costreimbursable fixedprice and guaranteed maximum price the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts during each of the five preceding fiscal years ended september 30 

  

   

in accordance with industry practice most of our contracts are subject to termination at the discretion of the client contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination 

  

when we are directly responsible for engineering design procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client’s plant or facility we reflect the costs of materials equipment and subcontracts in both revenues and costs on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs the following table presents the approximate amount of such passthrough costs included in revenues for each of the five preceding fiscal years ended september 30 in millions 

  

   

costreimbursable contracts 

costreimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit the profit element may be in the form of a simple markup applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee or a combination of a markup and a fee the fee element can also take several forms the fee may be a fixed amount as specified in the contract it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred or it may be an incentive fee based on targets milestones or performance factors defined in the contract in general we prefer costreimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price 

  

fixedprice contracts 

fixedprice contracts include both “negotiated fixedprice” contracts and “lump sum bid” contracts under a negotiated fixedprice contract we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client negotiated fixedprice contracts frequently exist in singleresponsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project under lump sum bid contracts we are required to bid against other contractors based on specifications the client furnishes this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks that are reduced by the negotiation process including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period thus although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us however because of economies that may be realized during the contract term both negotiated fixedprice and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than the other types of contracts over the past five years most of our fixedprice work has been either negotiated fixedprice contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services rather than turn key construction 

  

page 15 

guaranteed maximum price contracts 

guaranteed maximum price contracts are performed in the same manner as costreimbursable contracts however the total actual cost plus the fee cannot exceed the guaranteed price negotiated with the client if the total actual cost of the contract exceeds the guaranteed maximum price then we will bear at least some if not all of the excess in those cases where the total actual cost and fee are less than the guaranteed price we will often share the savings on a predetermined basis with the client these contracts are not our preferred form of contract because they often contribute to an adversarial relationship with clients which is contrary to our relationshipbased business model 

  

competition 

we engage in a highly competitive business some of our competitors are larger than us or are subsidiaries of larger companies and therefore may possess greater resources than we do furthermore because the technical professional aspects of our business do not usually require large amounts of capital there is relative ease of market entry for a new entrant possessing acceptable professional qualifications accordingly we compete with regional national and international firms within any specific geographic area certain competitors including regional competitors may possess greater resources than we do 

  

the extent of our competition varies according to the industries and markets we serve as well as the geographic areas in which we operate our largest competitors for engineering construction and maintenance services for process plants include the bechtel group inc fluor corporation foster wheeler corp washington group international kellogg brown  root aker kvaerner technip and amec plc in the area of buildings our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr inc hellmuth obata  kassabaum aecom technology turner construction and day  zimmermann in the area of infrastructure our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as parsons brinckerhoff urs corporation hntb and ws atkins in the area of us federal programs our principal competitors include several of the companies listed above as well as the shaw group saic ch2m hill weston solutions lockheed martin corporation tetra tech and computer sciences corporation and in the area of pulp and paper our principal competitors include bek and amec plc 

  

employees 

at september 30 2005 we had approximately 27200 fulltime staff employees including contract staff additionally as of september 30 2005 there were approximately 11400 persons employed in the field on a project basis the number of field employees varies in relation to the number and size of the maintenance and construction projects in progress at any particular time 

  

available information 

we regularly file various reports with the securities and exchange commission “sec” these reports include annual reports on form 10k and quarterly reports on form 10q we also file from time to time current reports on form 8k the public may read and copy any materials we file with the sec at the sec’s public reference room located at 450 fifth street nw washington dc 20549 in order obtain information about the operation of the public reference room a person may call the sec at 18007320330 the sec also maintains a site on the internet that contains reports proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the sec the sec’s website is httpwwwsecgov you may also read and download the various reports we file with the sec free of charge from our website httpwwwjacobscom

in addition to these properties we lease smaller project offices located throughout the united states the united kingdom and in certain other countries we maintain sales offices at many of our principal locations the majority of our offices and locations are leased we also rent a portion of our construction equipment on a shortterm basis 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

in the normal course of business we are subject to certain contractual guarantees litigation and investigations generally such guarantees relate to project schedules and plant performance most of the litigation involves us as a defendant in workers’ compensation personal injury environmental environmental exposure professional liability and other similar lawsuits in addition as a contractor providing services to agencies of the united states government we are subject to many levels of audits investigations and claims by or on behalf of the government with respect to contract performance pricing costs cost allocations and procurement practices 

  

management believes after consultation with counsel that such guarantees litigation united states government contractrelated audits investigations and claims should not have any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in addition to the matters described above we are involved in a dispute with a client relating to a large waste incineration project in europe the contract was entered into by one of our subsidiaries several years ago prior to the acquisition of that subsidiary the dispute involves proper waste feed content of residues final acceptance of the plant and costs of operation and maintenance of the plant we have initiated litigation against the client and are seeking in excess of € 400 million approximately 481 million in damages the client has filed a counterclaim against us which we believe is without merit we believe our claims are valid and enforceable and that we will be ultimately successful in obtaining a favorable judgment

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

the purpose of this management’s discussion and analysis “mda” is to provide an overview of the company’s financial condition and results of operations as well as an analysis of the factors that caused certain key elements of our financial statements to change from one year to the next 

  

in this discussion we may make statements that are not based on historical fact all such statements are expressly “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 although such statements are based on management’s current estimates and expectations and currently available competitive financial and economic data forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain we therefore caution the reader that there are a variety of factors could cause business conditions and results to differ materially from what is contained in our forwardlooking statements a list of some of the factors most likely to occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forwardlooking statements is presented at the end of this mda 

  

in this mda we use certain terms and abbreviations that are defined as follows 

  

   

overview 

net earnings in fiscal 2005 increased by 171 as compared to last year and eps diluted grew by 142 we saw increased revenues from clients operating in many of the industry groups and markets we serve but in particular oil  gas and refining and infrastructure contributing to the increase in revenues were the effects of including the results of operations of the babtie group for all 

  

page 21 

of fiscal 2005 and a 317 increase in passthrough costs when we are responsible for subcontract labor or thirdparty materials and equipment we reflect the costs of such items in both revenues and costs since passthrough costs which are incurred primarily on projects requiring field services typically do not have significant margins it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in revenues without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit 

  

our cash balances more than doubled during fiscal 2005 cash and cash equivalents increased from 1001 million at september 30 2004 to 2398 million at september 30 2005 our “net cash” defined as cash and cash equivalents less bank debt increased from 201 million at september 30 2004 to 1439 million at september 30 2005 additions to property and equipment used 439 million of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2005 as compared to 371 million last year our cash balances combined with a borrowing capacity of 2900 million under our longterm unsecured revolving credit facility provide sufficient capital resources for us to fund our ongoing operations 

  

critical accounting policies 

in order to understand better the changes that may occur to key elements of our financial condition and operating results a reader of this mda should endeavor to understand the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

  

the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business entity performing longterm engineering and constructiontype contracts requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect both the entity’s results of operations as well as the carrying values of its assets and liabilities although our significant accounting polices are described in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue accounting for contracts and use of joint ventures —in accounting for longterm engineering and constructiontype contracts we follow the provisions of the aicpa’s statement of position 811— accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts  in general we recognize revenues at the time we provide services depending on the commercial terms of the contract we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred or using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion this method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress in making such estimates judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule the cost of materials and labor and productivity and the impact of change orders liability claims contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee in some of the markets we serve there is an increasing trend towards costreimbursable contracts with incentivefee arrangements in certain instances we base our incentive fees on achievement of target completion dates target costs andor other performance criteria failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or nonrecoverable costs which could exceed revenues recognized from the project one such contract is with the us department of energy for the fernald closure project this contract provides for incentive fees based on schedule and cost in addition the terms of the contract stipulate that the incentive fees may not be fully billed to the doe until the completion of the project currently estimated to occur in 2007 at september 30 2005 we had recognized 384 million of deferred fees relating to this contractcompletion 

  

we provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known without regard to the percentage of completion 

  

page 22 

the nature of our business results in clients subcontractors or vendors occasionally presenting claims against us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible similarly and in the normal course of business we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible in those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract we would include in the total estimated costs of the contract and therefore the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract an estimate based on all relevant facts and circumstances available of the additional costs to be incurred in those situations where we have incurred additional costs for which we believe the client is contractually responsible we may present a claim to the client for such costs in such situations we include in revenues the amount of costs incurred without profit to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims 

  

certain costreimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment in this situation revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts in those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs not allowable under the terms of the contract we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly 

  

as is common in the industry we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures for certain of these joint ventures ie where we have an undivided interest in the assets and liabilities of the venture we recognize our proportionate share of joint venture revenues costs and operating profit in our consolidated statements of earnings for other investments in engineering and construction joint ventures we use the equity method of accounting 

  

accounting for stock issued to employees —we account for stockbased employee compensation using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb opinion no 25— accounting for stock issued to employees  accordingly on the date a stock option is granted to an employee we measure compensation cost based on the excess if any of the market price of the company’s common stock over the exercise price of the awarded option 

  

in accordance with current accounting standards we compute a pro forma expense amount for stock options issued and we disclose this pro forma expense amount in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we use the blackscholes option pricing model to compute the pro forma expense amount the blackscholes model however was developed for use in estimating the value of publiclytraded options that have no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable in addition the blackscholes model requires the use of assumptions in order to compute the hypothetical fair value of an option changes in these assumptions can cause drastically different values being assigned to a stock option accordingly we caution the readers of our consolidated financial statements that the results of applying the blackscholes model are not necessarily a reliable measure of the true fair value of stock options granted to employees 

  

in december 2004 the fasb adopted sfas no 123r— accounting for sharebased payment sfas 123r supersedes apb 25 and requires companies to record an expense in their financial statements for stockbased awards using valuation methods like blackscholes sfas 123r will be effective for the company beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2006 although we presently intend to adopt sfas 123r retrospectively there are several reasons why the expense we expect to record in the future relating to sharebased compensation may differ from the amounts we’ve disclosed in our prior pro forma disclosures first we have modified certain provisions of our broadbased employee 

  

page 23 

stock purchase plans to substantially eliminate the amount of expense that would otherwise be recorded under sfas 123r second the amount of stock options we will grant in the future is likely to be different from the level of awards that were made in the past and third the value assigned to the stock options we award in the future will be dependent on the assumptions used to value them to the extent these assumptions change the amount of expense we’ll recognize in the future will most likely vary from amounts recognized in the past 

  

accounting for pension plans —in accounting for pension plans we follow the provisions of sfas no 87— employers’ accounting for pensions sfas 87 requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans’ assets and liabilities these assumptions involve discount rates investment returns and projected salary increases among others we rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in valuing the financial position of the plans and to provide advice regarding the actuarial assumptions used the expected rates of return on plan assets for fiscal 2005 ranged from 60 to 90 unchanged from last year we believe this range of rates reflects the longterm returns expected on the plans’ assets considering projected rates of inflation the diversification of the plans’ assets and the expected real rates of market returns the discount rates used to compute plan liabilities were lowered from a range of 53 to 63 in fiscal 2004 to a range of 40 to 55 in fiscal 2005 changes in the actuarial assumptions may have a material affect on the plans’ assets and liabilities and the associated pension expense management together with our actuaries monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in order to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used 

  

in connection with the fiscal 2001 acquisition of certain engineering and contracting businesses from stork nv we are negotiating the value of certain plan assets and prior service obligations that may be transferred from a multiemployer pension plan into a new singleemployer pension plan we formed during fiscal 2004 for the benefit of our employees in the netherlands if such a transfer were to occur presently we believe the value of the assets we would receive would be less than the value of the prior service pension obligations we would assume included in “other deferred liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2005 is approximately 404 million for the prior service obligations relating to the multiemployer pension plan in the netherlands 

  

accounting for income taxes —we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109— accounting for income taxes  judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the normal course of our business we may engage in numerous transactions every day for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in income or deducted as an expense is uncertain additionally we file income franchise gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service most states in the united states and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the united states our effective tax rate increased from 35 during each of fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 to 36 during fiscal 2005 we routinely monitor the appropriateness of our worldwide tax rate and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates 

  

insurance matters litigation claims and contingencies —in the normal course of business we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation generally such guarantees relate to project schedules and plant performance most of the litigation in which we are concerned involves the company as a defendant in workers’ compensation personal injury environmental environmental exposure professional liability and other similar lawsuits we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations however we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under our insurance programs 

  

page 24 

this situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured in addition as a contractor providing services to various agencies of the united states federal government we are subject to many levels of audits investigations and claims by or on behalf of the us federal government with respect to contract performance pricing costs cost allocations and procurement practices 

  

in accordance with sfas no 5— accounting for contingencies  we record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such claims guarantees litigation and audits and investigations we rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in determining the level of reserves to establish for insurancerelated claims that are known and have been asserted against us and for insurancerelated claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates we include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations 

  

testing goodwill for impairment —in accordance with sfas no 142 —goodwill and other intangible assets  the amount of goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets is tested annually for possible impairment in conducting the impairment test we may apply in accordance with the provisions of sfas 142 various valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of our reporting units the values resulting from the application of these valuation techniques are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of our reporting units to a willing third party since the adoption of sfas 142 in fiscal 2002 we have not recorded any impairment loss associated with our goodwill 

  

foreign currencies —in general our principal exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating the financial statements of our subsidiaries operating outside the united states which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar into the us dollar we follow the provisions of sfas no 52— foreign currency translation in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

  

we believe our exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because our various operations invoice clients and satisfy their financial obligations primarily in their respective local functional currencies in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currencies we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs 

  

results of operations 

  

general 

our business focuses exclusively on providing technical professional and construction services to a large number of industrial commercial and governmental clients around the world the services we provide generally fall into four broad categories 

  

   

   

   

   

page 25 

the scope of services we can provide our clients therefore ranges from consulting and conceptual design services which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project to complete singleresponsibility designbuildoperate contracts 

  

the following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each year ended september 30 in thousands 

  

   

certain amounts for fiscal 2003 have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005 presentation 

  

we focus our services on clients operating in certain industry groups and markets we believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit crossutilization of our resources the following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each year ended september 30 in thousands 

  

   

“other” includes projects for clients operating in a number of industries including food and consumer products and basic resources such as mining minerals and fertilizers 

  

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 

we recorded net earnings of 1510 million or 257 per diluted share for fiscal year ended september 30 2005 compared to net earnings of 1290 million or 225 per diluted share for fiscal 2004 

  

total revenues for fiscal 2005 increased by 10 billion or 227 to 56 billion compared to total revenues of 46 billion for fiscal 2004 revenues increased among most of the industry groups and markets we serve lead by a 541 increase in revenues from clients operating in the oil  gas and refining industries and a 523 increase in revenues from clients operating in the infrastructure market the increase in revenues from our clients operating in the oil  gas and refining industries was due primarily to continuing projects we’re executing in the area of clean fuels combined with new awards of projects assisting refiners improve and enhance capacity also contributing to the increase in revenues were new awards in the upstream area of this market relating to oil sands extraction projects the increase in revenues from clients operating in the infrastructure market was due primarily to the 

  

page 26 

inclusion of the babtie group for all of fiscal 2005 the babtie group contributed approximately 3241 million of revenue during fiscal 2005 compared to approximately 540 million last year the babtie group was acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 also contributing to the increase in revenues was a 3698 million increase in passthrough costs when we are responsible for subcontract labor or thirdparty materials and equipment we reflect the costs of such items in both revenues and costs the level of passthrough costs included in revenues and costs will vary between reporting periods depending principally on the amount of procurement that clients choose to do themselves as opposed to using our services as well as on the normal winding down of field services activities on construction and om projects see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding passthrough costs 

  

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts were 857 for fiscal 2005 compared to 855 for fiscal 2004 the percentage relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided the increase in direct costs of contracts as a percentage of revenues was due to the increase in passthrough costs offset in part by the inclusion of the babtie group for all of fiscal 2005 whose revenues are weighted towards project services since passthrough costs which are incurred primarily on projects requiring field services typically do not generate significant margins it is not unusual for us to experience an increase or decrease in revenues without experiencing a corresponding increase or decrease in our gross margins and operating profit 

  

sga expenses during fiscal 2005 increased by 984 million or 211 to 5648 million compared to 4664 million during fiscal 2004 contributing to the increase in sga expenses during fiscal 2005 was the inclusion of the babtie group for the entire year the babtie group contributed approximately 896 million of sga expenses during fiscal 2005 versus approximately 135 million of sga expenses last year the balance of the increase was due primarily to the effects of foreign currency translation and higher spending in support of our professional technical services activities 

  

operating profit fiscal 2005 increased by 432 million or 218 to 2415 million compared to 1983 million during fiscal 2004 the increase in operating profit during fiscal 2005 as compared to last year was due to the overall increase in business activity as a percentage of revenues operating profit was 43 for fiscal 2005 and 2004 in spite of the significant increase in passthrough costs the company was able to maintain its level of operating profit by limiting the increase in sga expenses 

  

interest income increased by 13 million to 43 million during fiscal 2005 compared to 31 million of interest income during fiscal 2004 the increase in interest income was due primarily to higher cash balances on deposit during fiscal 2005 as compared to last year interest expense increased by 29 million to 65 million during fiscal 2005 compared to 36 million of interest expense during fiscal 2004 the increase in interest expense reflects the effects of the debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of the babtie group being outstanding for all of fiscal 2005 versus only a portion of fiscal 2004 

  

we recorded income tax expense of 850 million during fiscal 2005 compared to 694 million during fiscal 2004 our overall effective tax rate was 360 for fiscal 2005 and 350 for fiscal 2004 in the normal course of our business we may engage in numerous transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in income or deducted as an expense is uncertain additionally we file income franchise gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service most states in the united states and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the united states we continually monitor the appropriateness of the rate and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our 

  

page 27 

estimates the increase in our overall tax rate during fiscal 2005 as compared to last year was due primarily the effects of the nondeductibility for tax purposes of the amortization of certain intangible assets we acquired in connection with the babtie group combined with a shift in earnings among our nonus operations 

  

fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 

we recorded net earnings of 1290 million or 225 per diluted share for fiscal year ended september 30 2004 compared to net earnings of 1280 million or 227 per diluted share for fiscal 2003 

  

total revenues for fiscal 2004 remained relatively unchanged from fiscal 2003 at 46 billion the amount of passthrough costs included in revenues in fiscal 2004 declined by approximately 2236 million or 161 as compared to fiscal 2003 offsetting this decline in field services activity in part was approximately 540 million of revenues of the babtie group which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 

  

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts were 855 for fiscal 2004 compared to 864 for fiscal 2003 in general the percentage improvement in this performance indicator from fiscal 2003 to 2004 was due primarily to a higher portion of our total revenues being derived from technical professional services versus field services 

  

sga expenses for fiscal 2004 increased by 376 million or 88 to 4664 million compared to 4288 million for fiscal 2003 included in sga expenses for fiscal 2004 is approximately 135 million of sga expenses from the babtie group the balance of the increase was due primarily to the effects of foreign currency translation and higher spending in support of our professional technical services activities 

  

operating profit for fiscal 2004 totaled 1983 million relatively unchanged from the fiscal 2003 amount of 1971 million as a percentage of revenues operating profit was 43 for both fiscal 2004 and 2003 

  

interest income increased by 17 million to 31 million for fiscal 2004 compared to 14 million for fiscal 2003 the increase in interest income was due primarily to higher cash balances on deposit during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 interest expense increased by 03 million or 96 to 36 million for fiscal 2004 compared to 33 million for fiscal 2003 the increase in interest expense was due primarily to slightly higher borrowings under our longterm revolving credit facility 

  

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth certain information about our contractual obligations as of september 30 2005 in thousands 

  

   

page 28 

   

   

   

backlog 

the following table summarizes our total backlog at september 30 2005 2004 and 2003 in millions 

  

   

because the entire value of contracts is added to backlog as soon as the contracts are awarded to us rather than adding the contracts to backlog gradually over time and many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years we evaluate our backlog on a yearoveryear basis rather than on a sequential quarteroverquarter basis our backlog at september 30 2005 increased by 12 billion or 160 to 86 billion from 75 billion at september 30 2004 the increase in backlog during fiscal 2005 was attributable primarily to new awards from clients operating within the oil  gas federal programs and the civil and infrastructure industry groups and markets 

  

in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the discretion of the client however we have not experienced cancellations that have had a material effect on the reported backlog amounts in a situation where a client terminates a contract we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and in certain instances we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein 

  

total backlog at september 30 2005 included approximately 22 billion or 253 of total backlog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies this compares to approximately 23 billion or 302 of total backlog and 19 billion or 277 of total backlog of us federal backlog at september 30 2004 and 2003 respectively most of our federal contracts require that services be provided beyond one year in general these contracts must be funded annually ie the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the us congress to the procuring agency and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts 

  

we estimate that approximately 43 billion or 502 of total backlog at september 30 2005 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year 

  

page 29 

effects of inflation 

during fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 approximately 85 83 and 82 respectively of our consolidated revenues were earned under costreimbursable type contracts because a significant portion of our revenues is earned from such contracts the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations continue to be generally low however as we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixedprice and lumpsum work is more prevalent inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future to the extent permitted by competition we intend to continue to emphasize contracts which are either costreimbursable or negotiated fixedprice for contracts with fixedprice and lumpsum terms we closely monitor the actual costs on the project as compared to the original estimates on these projects we also attempt to secure fixedprice commitments from key subcontractors and vendors however due to the competitive nature of our business combined with the fluctuating demands and prices associated with personnel equipment and materials we traditionally need in order to perform on our contracts there can be no guarantee that inflation will not affect our results of operations in the future 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our operations primarily through cash provided by operations at september 30 2005 our principal source of liquidity consisted of 2398 million of cash and cash equivalents and 2004 million of available capacity under our 2900 million unsecured revolving credit facility discussed below 

  

during fiscal 2005 our cash and cash equivalents increased by 1398 million to 2398 million this compares to a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 261 million during fiscal 2004 and to a net increase of 777 million during fiscal 2003 during fiscal 2005 we experienced net cash inflows from operating activities and financing activities of 1613 million and 497 million respectively these inflows were offset in part by net cash outflows from investing activities and the effect of exchange rate changes of 683 million and 29 million respectively 

  

our operations provided net cash of 1613 million during fiscal 2005 this compares to net cash inflows of 878 million and 1475 million during fiscal 2004 and 2003 respectively the 736 million increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was due primarily to a 220 million increase in net earnings and a 202 million increase relating to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts also contributing to the increase in cash flows from operations were a 122 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense a noncash expense an 112 million decrease in gains attributable to the sale of assets a common reclassification within the consolidated statements of cash flows so that the cash flows from the sales of assets may be shown in the investing section of the statements and the effects of a 69 million change in the deferred income tax accounts 

  

we used 683 million of cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2005 for investing activities this compares to net cash outflows of 2031 million and 177 million during fiscal 2004 and 2003 respectively in comparing our investing activities during fiscal 2005 to last year the largest single variance related to cash used for acquisitions of businesses we used 1638 million of cash and cash equivalents for acquisitions last year and zero during fiscal 2005 this reduction in cash outflows was partially offset by a 178 million increase in miscellaneous noncurrent assets relating primarily to increases in prepaid pension assets and a 68 million increase in additions to property plant and equipment 

  

our financing activities resulted in net cash inflows of 497 million during fiscal 2005 this compares to net cash inflows of 914 million during fiscal 2004 and net cash outflows of 550 million during fiscal 2003 the 417 million decrease in cash flows from financing activities during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was due primarily to a 464 million decrease in borrowings net of 

  

page 30 

repayments under our longterm credit facilities combined with a net 86 million increase during fiscal 2005 in shortterm borrowings the higher borrowing activity during fiscal 2004 was due primarily to the acquisition of the babtie group also contributing to the improvement in cash flows from financing activities during fiscal 2005 as compared to last year was a 94 million increase in proceeds from issuances of common stock through our stock option and stock purchase plans 

  

we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future we had 2398 million in cash and cash equivalents at september 30 2005 compared to 1001 million at september 30 2004 our consolidated working capital position at september 30 2005 was 5523 million compared to 3976 million at september 30 2004 we have a longterm unsecured revolving credit facility providing up to 2900 million of debt capacity under which only 896 million was utilized at september 30 2005 in the form of direct borrowings we believe that the capacity terms and conditions of our longterm revolving credit facility is adequate for our working capital and general business requirements we also had at september 30 2005 360 million of borrowing capacity available to us through committed shortterm credit facilities 

  

under our stock repurchase program we are authorized by our board of directors to buyback up to 60 million shares of the common stock of the company in the open market repurchases of common stock are financed from existing credit facilities and available cash balances from inception of the program through september 30 2005 we have repurchased a total of 3732400 shares of common stock in the open market at a total cost of 590 million no shares of common stock were repurchased during fiscal 2005 and 2004 substantially all shares of common stock held in treasury were eventually reissued for our employee stock purchase and incentive stock plans 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

on december 16 2004 sfas no 123r— accounting for sharebased payment was issued sfas 123r is a revision of sfas 123 and supersedes apb 25 sfas 123r requires companies to record compensation expense for stockbased awards using a fair value method and is effective for annual periods beginning after june 15 2005 effective in fiscal 2006 for the company compensation expense will be recorded over the requisite service period which is typically the vesting period of the award we currently plan to adopt sfas 123r effective october 1 2005 using the modified retrospective application method and have begun the process of collecting and analyzing the information required we estimate that the adoption of sfas 123r will have an after tax impact of approximately 85 million in fiscal 2006 

  

factors that may affect forwardlooking statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk in the normal course of business our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 

  

interest rate risk 

our only source for longterm credit is a 2900 million syndicated revolving credit facility the total amount outstanding under this facility at september 30 2005 was 896 million this agreement expires in january 2010 and provides for both fixedrate and variablerate borrowings our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we maintain fixed rate debt on a majority of our borrowings and minimize our outstanding borrowings by paying down debt from cash provided from operations 

  

foreign currency risk 

in general our exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating the financial statements of our subsidiaries operating outside the united states which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar into the us dollar we follow the provisions of sfas no 52— foreign currency translation in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

  

page 32 

we believe our exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because in general our various operations invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations in their respective local currencies in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their own functional currencies we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs 

  

concurrent with the acquisition of the babtie group we entered into a forward contract with a large us bank in the notional amount of £399 million approximately 734 million the purpose of the contract is to hedge the company’s exposure to fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on a £399 million intercompany loan between jacobs and one of its subsidiaries based on the terms of the contract we believe the effect of the loan on future earnings at september 30 2005 should be limited to 41 million of expense in addition we entered into a floatingtofixed interest rate swap agreement with another us bank which fixes the effective rate of interest on £340 million then approximately 611 million of bank debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of the babtie group this instrument allows us to receive a floating rate payment tied to the 3month libor plus a spread from the counterparty in exchange for a fixedrate payment from us both of the aforementioned contracts qualify as cash flow hedges under the provisions sfas no 133— accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities

 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures the company’s management with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined by rule 13a15 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” as of september 30 2005 the end of the period covered by this annual report the “evaluation date” based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the evaluation date were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the company in reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act management with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the evaluation date based on the framework established in “ internal control—integrated framework”  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management has concluded that the internal controls of the company over its financial reporting as of the evaluation date were effective 

  

page 33 

changes in internal control there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f of the exchange act during the company’s fourth quarter ended september 30 2005 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

  

limitations on effectiveness of controls the company’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its system of internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed or operated can provide only reasonable but not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of internal control are met the design of the company’s control system reflects the fact that there are resource constraints and that the benefits of such control system must be considered relative to their costs further because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control failures and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the intentional acts of individuals by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions projections of management’s assessments of the current effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting are subject to risks

 item 1 business 

  

general 

jacobs engineering group inc was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware on january 8 1987 on march 4 1987 it succeeded by merger to the business and assets of jacobs engineering group inc a california corporation that in 1974 had succeeded to a business organized originally by dr joseph j jacobs in 1947 unless the context otherwise requires all references herein to “jacobs” or the “registrant” are to jacobs engineering group inc and its predecessors and references to the “company” “we” “us” or “our” are to both jacobs engineering group inc and its consolidated subsidiaries the registrant’s common stock has been publicly held since 1970 and is currently listed on the new york stock exchange 

  

we are one of the largest professional services firms in the united states our business focuses exclusively on providing a broad range of technical professional and construction services to a large number of industrial commercial and governmental clients around the world we provide project services which include engineering design architectural and similar services process scientific and systems consulting services operations and maintenance services and construction services which include directhire construction and construction management services we provide our services through offices and subsidiaries located principally in north america europe asia and australia 

  

we concentrate our services on selected industry groups and markets including oil and gas exploration production and refining us federal programs pharmaceuticals and biotechnology chemicals and polymers buildings which includes projects in the fields of health care and education as well as civic governmental and other buildings infrastructure technology and manufacturing and pulp and paper among others 

  

business strategy 

  

general 

there are four major components of our business strategy a relationshipbased approach to client interactions a strong focus on cost control an organizational structure that facilitates efficient project management and execution and safety 

  

relationshipbased business model 

our relationshipbased business model is central to our sustained growth and profitability we aggressively pursue the development of longterm affiliations and alliances with our clients by working as a partner with our clients on their capital programs we increase our understanding of their overall business needs as well as the unique technical requirements of their projects this allows us the opportunity to provide a greater range of services to our clients we market all of our services to clients for projects where the scope of work required is within our expertise by integrating and bundling our services ie providing design engineering and construction services on the same project we can price contracts more competitively and enhance overall profitability while delivering superior value to our clients our relationshipbased business model also helps us more fully understand the risks inherent in the projects which in turn allows us to manage those risks better our approach also provides us with opportunities to market those services our clients will need in the post startup and commissioning phases of a plant such as operations and maintenance services this model however does not preclude us from undertaking discrete projects that do not significantly conflict with our business strategy we will accept and perform discrete projects for our clients if we can negotiate acceptable pricing and other contract terms and conditions 

  

page 2 

cost control 

another important component of our business strategy is our continual emphasis on cost control as the global economy expands and companies are required to compete against each other across geographic boundaries the company that can provide its clients with cost efficient solutions to their project needs has the advantage our attention to cost control throughout every level of our organization allows us to deliver superior technical professional and construction services safely efficiently and within the cost and time parameters our clients require 

  

organizational structure 

our organizational structure and integrated system for delivering our services is another key component of our business strategy our operating units generally use a matrix organizational structure whereby our project management functions are supported by our various technical engineering design and construction disciplines that are necessary to effectively execute longterm contracts crucial functions such as project controls and procurement are local to each of our major locations and serve operations by providing the specialized services required in addition we actively employ a boundaryless approach to the way we serve our clients our operating groups do not compete against each other for contracts rather our organizational structure encourages our operating groups to work cohesively while simultaneously helping to reduce costs and promote an efficient delivery system for all of our services 

  

safety 

the final key component of our business strategy is our intense and uncompromising focus on safety maintaining safe work environments has long been a mutual and unequivocal condition of the relationship we have with our employees it is also a paramount issue in our dealings with our clients a safe work environment is critical to our longterm success and growth we maintain a centralized quality and safety group to help ensure that we provide services safely and in accordance with standard work processes unsafe job sites and office environments increase employee turnover increase the cost of a project to our clients and raise our operating costs as well safe job sites and office environments on the other hand benefit our clients promote employee morale and enhance the longterm relationships we have with our clients employees and business partners 

  

the role of acquisitions in our business strategy 

our relationshipbased business model is a significant driver of our acquisition activities when we review potential acquisition targets we are conscious of the effect the acquisition may have on our client base we favor acquisitions that allow us to expand or enhance the range of services we provide our clients andor gain access to new geographic areas in which our clients either already operate or plan to expand by expanding into new geographic areas and adding to our existing technical and project management capabilities we strive to position ourselves as a preferred singlesource provider of technical professional and construction services to our major clients the following is a brief description of some of our key mergers and acquisitions over the past five years 

  

   

page 3 

   

   

   

   

services provided 

as we discussed above our business is to provide technical professional and construction services the services we provide generally fall into four broad categories project services which includes engineering design architectural and similar services construction services operations and maintenance services and process scientific and systems consulting services the scope of services we can provide our clients therefore ranges from consulting and conceptual design services which clients often require in the very early stages of a project to complete singleresponsibility designbuildoperate contracts 

  

page 4 

the following table sets forth our revenues from each of our four service categories for each of the five fiscal years ended september 30 in thousands of dollars 

  

   

certain amounts for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 

  

project services 

we employ all of the engineering design architectural and related disciplines needed to design and engineer 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we also employ the requisite scientific technical and program management capabilities necessary to provide program integration testing and evaluation services for clients in the defense and aerospace industries our services include provision of it services to the united states federal government in support of information systems and technology centers and scientifictechnical services for various agencies of the united states federal government in support of environmental programs 

  

in the area of construction management we provide our clients with a wide range of services as an agent for our clients we may act as the program director whereby we oversee on the owner’s behalf the complete planning design and construction phases of the project alternatively our services may be limited to providing construction consulting 

  

also included in the category of “project services” are construction related services such as cost engineering planning scheduling procurement estimating project accounting and quality and safety necessary to support our engineering design construction construction and program management operations and maintenance and consulting services 

  

construction 

we provide traditional field construction services to private and public sector clients in virtually all of the industries to which we provide project services we also provide many of our clients with modular construction technology our modular approach is an advanced form of offsite engineering and design fabrication assembly and field erection a modular approach provides clients with an

alternative approach to traditional methods of engineering and construction which can compress and shorten the construction schedule in the environmental area we provide environmental remedial construction services for a variety of public and private sector clients 

  

historically our field construction activities have focused primarily on those construction projects for which we perform much of the related engineering and design work in doing so we minimize the risks associated with constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared by third parties the financial risk to us of constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared by third parties may be particularly significant on fixedprice contracts therefore we generally avoid this type of project however we continue to pursue constructiononly projects where we can negotiate pricing and other acceptable contract terms 

  

operations and maintenance “om” 

om generally refers to all of the tasks required to operate and maintain large complex facilities on behalf of clients in such situations we can provide key management and support services over all of the facility’s operations including subcontractors and other onsite personnel within the environmental area om often includes engineering and technical support services as well as program management services necessary to remediate contaminated sites within the aerospace and defense areas om often requires us to provide the management and technical support services necessary to operate and maintain engine test facilities weapons integration and hightech simulation and verification centers such om contracts also frequently require us to provide construction support services facilities management and maintenance services utilities operations and maintenance services and property management and disposition services 

  

this category also includes plant maintenance services which generally involves the tasks required to keep a plant typically a refinery or chemical plant in daytoday operation this would include for example the repair and replacement of pumps piping heat exchangers and other equipment as well as “turnaround” work which involves major refurbishment that can only be performed when the plant is shut down since shutdowns are expensive to the owners of the plant turnaround work often requires maximizing the number of skilled craft personnel that can work efficiently on a project on a 24hoursperday sevendaysperweek basis we use sophisticated computer scheduling and programming to complete turnaround projects quickly and we maintain contact with a large pool of skilled craft personnel we can hire as needed on maintenance and turnaround projects 

  

although the gross profit margins that we realize from om services are generally lower than those associated with the other services we provide the costs to support maintenance activities are also generally lower furthermore we view om contracts as presenting a lower financial risk to the company as compared to some of the other services we provides because om contracts are normally costreimbursable in nature additionally although engineering and construction projects may be of a shortterm nature om services often result in longterm relationships with clients for example we have been providing maintenance services at several major process plants for over 30 years this aspect of maintenance services greatly reduces the selling costs in respect of such services 

  

process scientific and systems consulting 

we employ all of the professional and technical expertise necessary to provide a broad range of consulting services including 

  

   

   

page 6 

   

   

   

   

also included in the category of “process scientific and systems consulting” are the professional and program management services required to assist clients such as the united states federal government and its agencies in a wide range of defense and aerospace related programs such services typically are more technical and scientific in nature than are other project services we provide and may involve such tasks as supporting the development and testing of conventional weapons systems weapons modeling and simulations computer systems development maintenance and support evaluation and testing of missioncritical control systems and other highly technical programs and tasks 

  

complementary nature of resources and business systems utilized 

there is a high degree of similarity of the workforces among our service categories for example engineering and design services ie services provided by persons who are degreed and in certain circumstances licensed such as engineers architects scientists and economists exist in all four service categories in addition there is a high degree of similarity among a significant component of the workforces we employ to perform on om and construction projects in providing om and construction services we employ a large number of skilled craft labor personnel these may include welders pipe fitters electricians crane operators and other personnel that work on very large capital projects in the case of projects classified within the construction services category or on smaller capital projects in the case of maintenance projects classified within the om services category 

  

our operating units use a matrix organizational structure our results therefore are dependent on groups representing technical disciplines eg electrical engineering chemical engineering cost engineering aerospace engineering etc supporting project management personnel who maintain the relationship between us and our clients and who are ultimately responsible for delivering projects to our clients safely on time and on budget additionally all of our operating regions and divisions use common tools policies and procedures to manage and run their respective businesses these include practices concerning such things as project review meetings project performance evaluations and project execution plans 

  

the use of technology throughout our organization is uniform whether it is computer aided design and drafting “cadd” applications used by our engineering and design staff or modeling programs used by the scientific and consulting staff or scheduling estimating and cost control applications used by homeoffice personnel in support of our construction and maintenance activities all of the service categories described above are equally vulnerable to changes in technology as they occur in the economy at large 

  

industry groups and markets 

we focus our services on clients that operate in the following industry groups and markets oil and gas exploration production and refining united states federal programs pharmaceuticals and biotechnology chemicals and polymers buildings both public and private sector infrastructure technology and manufacturing and pulp and paper we also provide services to clients in other industries and markets such as food and consumer products and basic resources eg mining minerals and fertilizers among others we believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit crossutilization of our resources and help to mitigate the negative effects of a downturn in a single industry 

  

page 7 

the following table sets forth our revenues from each of these industry groups and markets for each of the five fiscal years ended september 30 in thousands of dollars

backlog 

for information regarding our backlog refer to item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 

  

significant customers 

for the fiscal years ended september 30 2004 2003 2002 2001 and 2000 revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the united states federal government accounted for 223 226 215 190 and 200 respectively of total revenues 

  

financial information about geographic areas 

for financial information regarding geographic areas in which we operate please refer to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements listed in item 15 below 

  

contracts 

while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake our contracts generally fall into three broad categories costreimbursable fixedprice and guaranteed maximum price the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts during each of the five preceding fiscal years ended september 30 

  

   

page 14 

in accordance with industry practice most of our contracts are subject to termination at the discretion of the client contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of termination 

  

when we are directly responsible for engineering design procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client’s plant or facility we reflect the costs of materials equipment and subcontracts in both revenues and costs on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly and we have no associated responsibility for such items these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs the following table presents the approximate amount of such passthrough costs included in revenues for each of the five preceding fiscal years ended september 30 in millions 

  

   

costreimbursable contracts 

costreimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit the profit element may be in the form of a simple markup applied to the labor costs incurred or it may be in the form of a fee or a combination of a markup and a fee the fee element can also take several forms the fee may be a fixed amount as specified in the contract it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred or it may be an incentive fee based on targets milestones or performance factors defined in the contract in general we prefer costreimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price 

  

fixedprice contracts 

fixedprice contracts include both “negotiated fixedprice” contracts and “lump sum bid” contracts under a negotiated fixedprice contract we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client negotiated fixedprice contracts frequently exist in singleresponsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project under lump sum bid contracts we are required to bid against other contractors based on specifications the client furnishes this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks that are reduced by the negotiation process including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications received problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period thus although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us however because of economies that may be realized during the contract term both negotiated fixedprice and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than the other types of contracts over the past five years most of our fixedprice work has been either negotiated fixedprice contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services rather than turn key construction 

  

guaranteed maximum price contracts 

guaranteed maximum price contracts are performed in the same manner as costreimbursable contracts however the total actual cost plus the fee cannot exceed the guaranteed price negotiated with the client if the total actual cost of the contract exceeds the guaranteed maximum price then we will bear at least some if not all of the excess in those cases where the total actual cost and fee are less than the guaranteed price we will often share the savings on a predetermined basis with the client these contracts are not our preferred form of contract because they often contribute to an adversarial relationship with clients which is contrary to our relationshipbased business model 

  

page 15 

competition 

we engage in a highly competitive business some of our competitors are larger than we are or are subsidiaries of larger companies and therefore may possess greater resources than we do furthermore because the technical professional aspects of our business do not usually require large amounts of capital there is relative ease of market entry for a new entrant possessing acceptable professional qualifications accordingly we compete with regional national and international firms within any specific geographic area certain competitors including regional competitors may possess greater resources than we do 

  

the extent of our competition varies according to the industries and markets we serve as well as the geographic areas in which we operate our largest competitors for engineering construction and maintenance services for process plants include the bechtel group inc fluor corporation foster wheeler corp washington group international kellogg brown  root aker kvaerner technip and amec plc in the area of buildings our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr inc hellmuth obata  kassabaum aecom technology turner construction and day  zimmermann in the area of infrastructure our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as parsons brinckerhoff urs corporation hntb and ws atkins in the area of pulp and paper our principal competitors also include bek and in the area of federal programs our principal competitors include several of the companies listed above as well as the shaw group montgomery watson saic ch2m hill boeing northrop grumman lockheed martin corporation and computer sciences corporation 

  

employees 

at september 30 2004 we had approximately 24400 fulltime staff employees including contract staff additionally as of september 30 2004 there were approximately 11000 persons employed in the field on a project basis the number of field employees varies in relation to the number and size of the maintenance and construction projects in progress at any particular time 

  

available information 

we regularly file various reports with the securities and exchange commission “sec” these reports include annual reports on form 10k and quarterly reports on form 10q we also file from time to time current reports on form 8k the public may read and copy any materials we file with the sec at the sec’s public reference room located at 450 fifth street nw washington dc 20549 in order obtain information about the operation of the public reference room a person may call the sec at 18007320330 the sec also maintains a site on the internet that contains reports proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the sec the sec’s website is httpwwwsecgov you may also read and download the various reports we file with the sec from our website httpwwwjacobscom

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

in the normal course of business we are subject to certain contractual guarantees litigation and investigations generally such guarantees relate to project schedules and plant performance most of the litigation involves us as a defendant in workers’ compensation personal injury environmental environmental exposure professional liability and other similar lawsuits in addition as a contractor for many agencies of the united states government we are subject to many levels of audits investigations and claims by or on behalf of the government with respect to contract performance pricing costs cost allocations and procurement practices 

  

management believes after consultation with counsel that such guarantees litigation united states government contractrelated audits investigations and claims should not have any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in addition to the matters described above we are involved in a dispute with a client relating to a large waste incineration project in europe the contract was entered into by one of our subsidiaries several years ago prior to the acquisition of that subsidiary the dispute involves proper waste feed content of residues final acceptance of the plant and costs of operation and maintenance of the plant we have initiated litigation against the client and are seeking in excess of € 400 million approximately 497 million in damages the client has filed a counterclaim against us which we believe is without merit we believe our claims are valid and enforceable and that we will be ultimately successful in obtaining a favorable judgment

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

the purpose of this management’s discussion and analysis “mda” is to provide an overview of the company’s financial condition and results of operations as well as an analysis of the factors that caused certain key elements of our financial statements to change from one year to the next 

  

in this discussion we may make statements that are not based on historical fact all such statements are “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of private securities litigation reform act of 1995 although such statements are based on management’s current estimates and expectations and currently available competitive financial and economic data forwardlooking statements are inherently uncertain and we caution the reader that a variety of factors could cause business conditions and results to differ materially from what is contained in our forwardlooking statements a list of some of the factors most likely to occur that could cause actual results to differ from our forwardlooking statements is presented at the end of this mda 

  

in this mda we use certain terms and abbreviations that are defined as follows 

  

   

overview 

our operating results for fiscal 2004 reflected growth in earnings that was below management’s expectations during the third quarter of fiscal 2004 we had several projects where our work was either suspended or delayed and one project that was cancelled entirely although changes in the timing of when work required by large projects commences is not unusual the magnitude of the delays and cancellation that occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2004 had a significant impact on our results of operations for both the third and fourth fiscal quarters these delays and cancellations contributed to a decline in revenues and hindered our ability to absorb the increase in our sga expenses also contributing to the decrease in revenues during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was a decline in passthrough costs when we are responsible for subcontract labor or thirdparty materials and equipment we reflect the costs of such items in both revenues and costs since passthrough costs which are incurred primarily on projects requiring field services typically do not have 

  

page 21 

significant margins we can experience a decline in revenues without experiencing a corresponding decline in our gross margins and operating profit 

  

the increase in the technical and professional services component of our revenues relative to passthrough costs was the chief reason for the improved gross margins for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 gross margins increased by 388 million or 62 during fiscal 2004 as compared to last year however due to increased ga spending in support of higher homeoffice services our operating profit percentage remained at 43 of revenues for fiscal 2004 the same percentage as fiscal 2003 

  

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 we completed the acquisition of the babtie group for a total cash purchase price of £920 million approximately 1693 million headquartered in scotland the babtie group is a leading provider of technical and professional services to clients in the infrastructure facilities environmental defense and governmental outsourcing markets among others although the babtie group employs approximately 3500 people and generates approximately 3000 million of revenues annually the effect of the acquisition on our fiscal 2004 results of operations was not material 

  

because i the entire value of contracts is added to backlog as soon as the contracts are awarded to us rather than adding the contracts to backlog gradually over time and ii many of our contracts require us to provide services that span over a number of fiscal quarters and sometimes over fiscal years we evaluate our backlog on a yearoveryear basis rather than on a sequential quarteroverquarter basis our backlog at september 30 2004 increased by 4115 million or 58 to 75 billion from 70 billion at september 30 2003 the increase in backlog during fiscal 2004 was attributable primarily to the addition of the babtie group combined with new awards from clients within the oil  gas and refining industries and the us federal program area of our business backlog at september 30 2004 reflects the project cancellation discussed above in addition approximately 1500 million of procurement backlog was removed during the third quarter of fiscal 2004 as well as approximately 1600 million of backlog relating to public sector work when it was determined that we would not receive the full value of the contract award 

  

our cash balances remained strong during fiscal 2004 in spite of the cash used to acquire the babtie group and an increase in acquisitions of property and equipment cash and cash equivalents totaled 1001 million at september 30 2004 compared to 1262 million at september 30 2003 our cash balances combined with a borrowing capacity of 2900 million under our longterm unsecured revolving credit facility present sufficient capital resources for us to fund our ongoing operations 

  

additions to property and equipment totaled 371 million during fiscal 2004 this was 113 million or 438 higher than the amount spent during fiscal 2003 contributing to the increase was certain initiatives to expand office space in several of our larger offices in the united states and united kingdom 

  

critical accounting policies 

in order to better understand changes that may occur to key elements of our financial condition and operating results a reader of this mda should understand the critical accounting policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

  

the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business entity performing longterm engineering and constructiontype contracts requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect both the entity’s results of operations as well as the carrying values of its assets and liabilities although our significant accounting polices are described in note 2 of the notes to 

  

page 22 

consolidated financial statements the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue accounting for contracts and use of joint ventures —in accounting for longterm engineering and constructiontype contracts we follow the provisions of the aicpa’s statement of position 811— accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts  in general we recognize revenues at the time we provide services depending on the commercial terms of the contract we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred or using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion this method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete contracts in progress in making such estimates judgments are required to evaluate contingencies such as potential variances in schedule the cost of materials and labor and productivity and the impact of change orders liability claims contract disputes and achievement of contractual performance standards many of our engineering and construction contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fixed or percentage fee in some of the markets we serve there is an increasing trend towards costreimbursable contracts with incentivefee arrangements in certain instances we base our incentive fees on achievement of target completion dates target costs andor other performance criteria failure to meet these targets or increases in contract costs can result in unrealized incentive fees or nonrecoverable costs which could exceed revenues recognized from the project one such contract is with the us department of energy for the fernald closure project this contract provides for incentive fees based on schedule and cost in addition the terms of the contract stipulate that the incentive fees may not be fully billed to the doe until the completion of the project currently estimated to occur in 2007 at september 30 2004 we had recognized 258 million of deferred fees relating to this contract 

  

we provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known without regard to the percentage of completion 

  

the nature of our business results in clients subcontractors or vendors occasionally presenting claims against us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible similarly and in the normal course of business we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible in those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract we would include in the total estimated costs of the contract and therefore the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract an estimate based on the relevant facts and circumstances available of the additional costs to be incurred in those situations where we have incurred additional costs for which we believe the client is contractually responsible we may present a claim to the client for such costs in such situations we include in revenues the amount of costs incurred without profit to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims 

  

certain costreimbursable contracts with government customers as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment in this situation revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts in those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs not allowable under the terms of the contract we estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly 

  

as is common in the industry we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through various forms of joint ventures for certain of these joint ventures ie where we have an undivided interest in the assets and liabilities of the venture we recognize our proportionate share of joint venture 

  

page 23 

revenues costs and operating profit in our consolidated statements of earnings for other investments in engineering and construction joint ventures we use the equity method of accounting 

  

accounting for stock issued to employees —we account for stockbased employee compensation using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb opinion no 25— accounting for stock issued to employees  accordingly on the date a stock option is granted to an employee we measure compensation cost based on the excess if any of the market price of the company’s common stock over the exercise price of the awarded option 

  

in accordance with current accounting standards we compute a pro forma expense amount for stock options issued and we disclose this pro forma expense amount in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we use the blackscholes option pricing model to compute the pro forma expense amount the blackscholes model however was developed for use in estimating the value of publiclytraded options that have no vesting restrictions and which are fully transferable in addition the blackscholes model requires the use of assumptions in order to compute the hypothetical fair value of an option changes in these assumptions can cause drastically different values being assigned to a stock option accordingly we caution the readers of our consolidated financial statements that the results of applying the blackscholes model are not necessarily a reliable measure of the true fair value of stock options granted to employees 

  

accounting for pension plans —in accounting for pension plans we follow the provisions of sfas no 87— employers’ accounting for pensions sfas 87 requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans’ assets and liabilities these assumptions involve discount rates investment returns and projected salary increases among others we rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in valuing the financial position of the plans and to provide advice regarding the actuarial assumptions used during fiscal 2004 we lowered slightly our expected rate of return on plan assets from a range of 80 to 90 in fiscal 2003 to a range of 60 to 90 in fiscal 2004 we believe this reduction better reflects the longterm returns expected on the plans’ assets considering projected rates of inflation the diversification of the plans’ assets and the expected real rates of market returns changes in the actuarial assumptions may have a material affect on the plans’ assets and liabilities and the associated pension expense management together with our actuaries monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in order to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used 

  

in connection with the fiscal 2001 acquisition of certain engineering and contracting businesses from stork nv we are negotiating the value of certain plan assets and prior service obligations that may be transferred from a multiemployer pension plan into a new singleemployer pension plan we formed during fiscal 2004 for the benefit of our employees in the netherlands if such a transfer were to occur presently we believe the value of the assets we would receive would be less than the value of the prior service pension obligations we would assume included in “other deferred liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2004 is approximately 423 million for the prior service obligations relating to the multiemployer pension plan in the netherlands 

  

accounting for income taxes —we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 109— accounting for income taxes  judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes in the normal course of our business we may engage in numerous transactions every day for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in taxable income or deducted as an expense is uncertain additionally we file income franchise gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service most states in the united states and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the united states although our effective tax rate has been 35 during fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 we continually monitor the 

  

page 24 

appropriateness of the rate and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates 

  

insurance matters litigation claims and contingencies —in the normal course of business we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation generally such guarantees relate to project schedules and plant performance most of the litigation in which we are concerned involves the company as a defendant in workers’ compensation personal injury environmental environmental exposure professional liability and other similar lawsuits we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations however we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under our insurance programs this situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured in addition as a contractor providing services to various agencies of the united states federal government we are subject to many levels of audits investigations and claims by or on behalf of the us federal government with respect to contract performance pricing costs cost allocations and procurement practices 

  

in accordance with sfas no 5— accounting for contingencies  we record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such claims guarantees litigation and audits and investigations we rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in determining the level of reserves to establish for both insurancerelated claims that are known and have been asserted against us as well as for insurancerelated claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates we include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations 

  

testing goodwill for impairment —in accordance with sfas no 142 —goodwill and other intangible assets “sfas 142” the amount of goodwill carried in our consolidated balance sheets is tested annually for possible impairment in conducting the impairment test we may apply in accordance with the provisions of sfas 142 various techniques to estimate the fair value of our reporting units these techniques are inherently subjective and the resulting values are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of our reporting units to a willing third party since the adoption of sfas 142 in fiscal 2002 we have not recorded any impairment loss associated with our goodwill 

  

operations outside the united states —in general our principal exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar into the us dollar we follow the provisions of sfas no 52— foreign currency translation in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

  

we believe our exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because our various operations invoice clients and satisfy their financial obligations primarily in their respective local functional currencies in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currencies we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs 

  

results of operations 

  

general 

our business focuses exclusively on providing technical professional and construction services to a large number of industrial commercial and governmental clients around the world the services we provide generally fall into four broad categories 

  

   

page 25 

   

   

   

the scope of services we can provide our clients therefore ranges from consulting and conceptual design services which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project to complete singleresponsibility designbuildoperate contracts 

  

the following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each year ended september 30 in thousands 

  

   

beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we classify certain elements of revenues as construction that were classified previously as project services in addition certain amounts for fiscal 2002 and 2003 have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2004 presentation 

  

we focus our services on certain industry groups and markets that we believe have sufficient common needs to permit crossutilization of our resources the following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each year ended september 30 in thousands 

  

   

“other” includes projects for clients operating in a number of industries including food and consumer products and basic resources such as mining minerals and fertilizers 

  

fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 

we recorded net earnings of 1290 million or 225 per diluted share for fiscal year ended september 30 2004 compared to net earnings of 1280 million or 227 per diluted share for fiscal 2003 

  

page 26 

total revenues for fiscal 2004 remained relatively unchanged from fiscal 2003 at 46 billion the amount of passthrough costs included in revenues in fiscal 2004 declined by approximately 2236 million or 161 as compared to fiscal 2003 the level of passthrough costs included in revenues and costs will vary between reporting periods depending principally on the amount of procurement that clients choose to do themselves as opposed to using our services as well as on the normal winding down of field services activities on construction and om projects see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of passthrough costs offsetting this decline in field services activity in part was approximately 540 million of revenues of the babtie group which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 the babtie group is a leading provider of technical and professional services to clients in the infrastructure facilities environmental defense and governmental outsourcing markets among others 

  

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts were 855 for fiscal 2004 compared to 864 for fiscal 2003 the percentage relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided in general the percentage improvement in this performance indicator from fiscal 2003 to 2004 was due primarily to a higher portion of our total revenues being derived from technical professional services versus field services 

  

sga expenses for fiscal 2004 increased by 376 million or 88 to 4664 million compared to 4288 million for fiscal 2003 included in sga expenses for fiscal 2004 is approximately 135 million of sga expenses from the babtie group the balance of the increase was due primarily to the effects of foreign currency translation and higher spending in support of our professional technical services activities 

  

operating profit for fiscal 2004 totaled 1983 million relatively unchanged from the fiscal 2003 amount of 1971 million as a percentage of revenues operating profit was 43 for both fiscal 2004 and 2003 

  

interest income increased by 17 million to 31 million for fiscal 2004 compared to 14 million for fiscal 2003 the increase in interest income was due primarily to higher cash balances on deposit during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 interest expense increased by 03 million or 96 to 36 million for fiscal 2004 compared to 33 million for fiscal 2003 the increase in interest expense was due primarily to slightly higher borrowings under our longterm revolving credit facility 

  

we recorded income tax expense of 694 million and 689 million for fiscal 2004 and 2003 respectively our overall effective tax rate was 350 for both fiscal years in the normal course of our business we may engage in numerous transactions every day for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in taxable income or deducted as an expense is uncertain additionally we file income franchise gross receipts and similar tax returns in many jurisdictions our tax returns are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service most states in the united states and by various government agencies representing many jurisdictions outside the united states although our effective tax rate has been 35 for fiscal 2004 and 2003 we continually monitor the appropriateness of the rate and we adjust our income tax expense in the period it is probable that actual results will differ from our estimates 

  

fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 

we recorded net earnings of 1280 million or 227 per diluted share for fiscal year ended september 30 2003 compared to net earnings of 1097 million or 198 per diluted share for fiscal 2002 

  

page 27 

total revenues for fiscal 2003 increased by 599 million or 13 to 46 billion compared to fiscal 2002 our revenues were relatively flat during the current fiscal year primarily attributable to a 1524 million or 99 decline in passthrough costs the amount of passthrough costs included in revenues during fiscal 2003 totaled 14 billion compared to 15 billion during fiscal 2002 

  

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts were 864 for fiscal 2003 compared to 872 for fiscal 2002 the percentage relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided 

  

sga expenses for fiscal 2003 increased by 175 million or 42 to 4288 million compared to 4113 million for fiscal 2002 the increase in sga expenses included the impact of the operations of mcdermott engineers  constructors canada limited including delta catalytic and delta hudson engineering collectively “delta” for a full twelve months in the current fiscal year compared to only eleven months in fiscal 2002 since we completed the acquisition of delta on october 31 2001 had delta’s operations been included for a full twelve months for fiscal 2002 sga expenses would have been higher by an additional 09 million as a percentage of revenues consolidated sga expenses increased to 93 in fiscal 2003 compared to 90 in fiscal 2002 management continues efforts to tighten controls over discretionary spending 

  

despite a relatively flat revenue stream during fiscal 2003 our operating profit increased by 247 million or 144 to 1971 million compared to 1724 million during fiscal 2002 as a percentage of revenues operating profit increased to 43 in fiscal 2003 compared to 38 in fiscal 2002 the increase in our operating profit was due primarily to improved margins 

  

interest expense decreased by 42 million or 566 to 33 million in fiscal 2003 compared to 75 million in fiscal 2002 due to significantly reduced borrowing levels in august 2003 we entered into a new five year 2900 million unsecured revolving bank credit agreement and terminated the existing revolving credit facilities that had an aggregate borrowing capacity of 2750 million the previous facilities that were replaced were scheduled to expire in january 2004 amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities totaled 178 million bearing interest of 29 at september 30 2003 compared to 857 million bearing interest of 38 at september 30 2002 see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our borrowings 

  

we recorded income tax expense of 689 million and 591 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002 respectively our overall effective tax rate was 350 for both fiscal 2003 and 2002 

  

contractual obligations 

the following table sets forth certain information about our contractual obligations as of september 30 2004 in thousands 

  

   

page 28 

   

   

   

backlog 

  

the following table summarizes our total backlog at september 30 2003 2002 and 2001 in millions 

  

   

in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the option of the client however we have not experienced cancellations that have had a material effect on the reported backlog amounts in a situation where a client terminates a contract we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and in certain instances we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein 

  

in fiscal 2002 we began classifying as “field services” backlog certain engineering and scientific and systems consulting activities relating to operations and maintenance contracts that had been classified previously as “technical professional services” backlog backlog for fiscal years 2001 has been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2002 presentation 

  

total backlog at september 30 2004 included approximately 23 billion or 302 of total backlog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies this compares to approximately 19 billion or 277 and 18 billion or 276 of us federal backlog at september 30 2003 and 2002 respectively most of our federal contracts extend beyond one year in general these contracts must be funded annually ie the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by the us congress to the procuring agency and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts 

  

our backlog for fiscal 2004 increased by 4115 million or 58 to 75 billion compared to fiscal 2003 and increased in fiscal 2003 by 3668 million or 55 to 70 billion compared to fiscal 2002 the increase in backlog during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was attributable primarily to the addition of the babtie group combined with new awards from clients within the oil  gas and refining industries and the us federal program area of our business the increase in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was attributable primarily to new awards from clients in the oil  gas and refining industries combined with new us federal program awards 

  

page 29 

we estimate that approximately 37 billion or 492 of total backlog at september 30 2004 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year 

  

effects of inflation 

during fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 approximately 83 82 and 85 respectively of our consolidated revenues were realized from costreimbursable type contracts because a significant portion of our revenues continues to be earned under costreimbursable type contracts the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations continue to be generally low however as we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixedprice and lumpsum work is more prevalent inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future to the extent permitted by competition we intend to continue to emphasize contracts which are either costreimbursable or negotiated fixedprice for contracts with fixedprice and lumpsum terms we closely monitor the actual costs on the project as compared to the original estimates on these projects we also attempt to secure fixedprice commitments from key subcontractors and vendors however due to the competitive nature of our business combined with the fluctuating demands and prices associated with personnel equipment and materials we traditionally need in order to perform on our contracts there can be no guarantee that inflation will not affect our results of operations in the future 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our operations primarily through cash provided by operations at september 30 2004 our principal source of liquidity consisted of 1001 million of cash and cash equivalents and 2112 million of available capacity under our 2900 million revolving credit facility discussed below 

  

during fiscal 2004 our cash and cash equivalents decreased by 261 million to 1001 million this compares to a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of 777 million to 1262 million during fiscal 2003 and to a net decrease of 08 million to 485 million during fiscal 2002 during fiscal 2004 we experienced net cash inflows from operating activities and financing activities of 878 million and 914 million respectively these inflows were offset by net cash outflows from investing activities and the effect of exchange rate changes of 2031 million and 21 million respectively 

  

our operations provided net cash of 878 million during fiscal 2004 this compares to net cash inflows of 1475 million and 1608 million during fiscal 2003 and 2002 respectively the 598 million decrease in cash provided by operations in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was due primarily to a decrease of 381 million relating to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts also contributing to the decline in cash flows from operations was the effects of a 140 million change in deferred income taxes and a 75 million increase in gains from the sales of assets the cash flows associated with which are shown in the investing section of the consolidated statements of cash flows 

  

the net cash we used for investing activities was 2031 million during fiscal 2004 this compares to net cash outflows of 177 million and 925 million during fiscal 2003 and 2002 respectively the net increase of 1854 million in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was due primarily to an increase of 1638 million in cash used for acquisitions also contributing to the increase in cash used for investing activities was a 113 million increase in additions to property and equipment a 107 million increase in investments and other noncurrent assets and a 41 decrease in cash proceeds from the sales of investments offsetting these increases in part was a 45 million increase in proceeds from sales of property and equipment 

  

our financing activities resulted in net cash inflows of 914 million during fiscal 2004 this compares to net cash outflows of 550 million and 647 million during fiscal 2003 and 2002 respectively the 1463 million increase in cash flows from financing activities during fiscal 2004 as 

  

page 30 

compared to fiscal 2003 was due primarily to a 547 million increase in borrowings net of repayments under our longterm credit facilities combined with a 774 million reduction during fiscal 2004 of cash used to payoff shortterm indebtedness 

  

we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future we had 1001 million in cash and cash equivalents at september 30 2004 compared to 1262 million at september 30 2003 our consolidated working capital position at september 30 2004 was 3976 million compared to 3587 million at september 30 2003 we have a longterm unsecured revolving credit facility providing up to 2900 million of debt capacity under which only 780 million was utilized at september 30 2004 in the form of direct borrowings we believe that the capacity terms and conditions of our longterm revolving credit facility is adequate for our working capital and general business requirements as well as the working capital needs associated with the acquisition of the babtie group we also had at september 30 2004 386 million of borrowing capacity available to us through committed shortterm credit facilities 

  

under our stock repurchase program we are authorized by our board of directors to buyback up to 60 million shares of the common stock of the company in the open market repurchases of common stock are financed from existing credit facilities and available cash balances from inception of the program through september 30 2004 we have repurchased a total of 3732400 shares of common stock in the open market at a total cost of 590 million no shares of common stock were repurchased during fiscal 2004 and 2003 substantially all shares of common stock held in treasury were eventually reissued for our employee stock purchase and incentive stock plans 

  

factors that may affect forwardlooking statements 

as mentioned above there are a variety of factors that could cause business conditions and results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements contained in this mda including in no particular order the following

the preceding list is not allinclusive and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise readers of this management’s discussion and analysis should also read our most recent annual report on form 10k for a further description of our business legal proceedings and other information that describes factors that could cause actual results to differ from such forwardlooking statements 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk in the normal course of business our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 

  

interest rate risk 

our only source for longterm credit is a 2900 million syndicated revolving credit facility the total amount outstanding under this facility at september 30 2004 was 788 million this agreement expires in august of 2008 and provides for both fixedrate and variablerate borrowings our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we maintain fixed rate debt on a majority of our borrowings and minimize our outstanding borrowings by paying down debt from cash provided from operations 

  

foreign currency risk 

in general our exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating the financial statements of our subsidiaries operating outside the united states which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar into the us dollar we follow the provisions of sfas no 52— foreign currency translation in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

  

we believe our exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because in general our various operations invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations in their respective local currencies in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their own functional currencies we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs 

  

in connection with the acquisition of the babtie group we entered into a forward contract with a large us bank in the notional amount of £399 million approximately 734 million the purpose of the contract was to hedge the company’s foreign currency exchange exposure on a £399 million intercompany loan between jacobs and one of its subsidiaries regardless of the degree to which the value of british sterling may decline against the us dollar the maximum potential effect on our future earnings will be limited to 50 million the forward contract qualifies as a cash flow hedge under the provisions sfas no 133— accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities

 item 1 business 

  

general 

jacobs engineering group inc was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware on january 8 1987 on march 4 1987 it succeeded by merger to the business and assets of jacobs engineering group inc a california corporation that in 1974 had succeeded to a business organized originally by dr joseph j jacobs in 1947 unless the context otherwise requires all references herein to “jacobs” or the “registrant” are to jacobs engineering group inc and its predecessors and references to the “company” “we” “us” or “our” are to both jacobs engineering group inc and its consolidated subsidiaries the registrant’s common stock has been publicly held since 1970 and is currently listed on the new york stock exchange 

  

we are one of the largest professional services firms in the united states our business focuses exclusively on providing a broad range of technical professional and construction services to a large number of industrial commercial and governmental clients around the world we provide project services which include engineering design architectural and similar services process scientific and systems consulting services operations and maintenance services and construction services which include directhire construction and construction management services we provide our services through offices and subsidiaries located in north america europe asia and australia 

  

we concentrate our services on selected industry groups and markets including oil and gas exploration production and refining us federal programs pharmaceuticals and biotechnology chemicals and polymers buildings which includes projects in the fields of health care and education as well as civic governmental and other buildings infrastructure technology and manufacturing and pulp and paper among others 

  

business strategy 

  

general 

there are four major components of our business strategy a relationshipbased approach to client interactions a strong focus on cost control an organizational structure that facilitates efficient project management and execution and safety 

  

relationshipbased business model 

our relationshipbased business model is central to our sustained growth and profitability we aggressively pursue the development of longterm affiliations and alliances with our clients by working as a partner with our clients on their capital programs we increase our understanding of their overall business needs as well as the unique technical requirements of their projects this allows us the opportunity to provide a greater range of services to our clients we market all of our services to clients for projects where the scope of work required is within our expertise by integrating and bundling our services ie providing design engineering and construction services on the same project we can price contracts more competitively and enhance overall profitability while delivering superior value to our clients our relationshipbased business model also helps us more fully understand the risks inherent in the projects which in turn allows us to manage those risks better our approach also provides us with opportunities to market those services our clients need in the post startup and commissioning phases of a plant such as operations and maintenance services this model however does not preclude us from undertaking discrete projects that do not significantly conflict with our business strategy we will accept and perform discrete projects for our clients if we can negotiate acceptable pricing and other contract terms 

  

page 2 

cost control 

another important component of our business strategy is our continual emphasis on cost control as the global economy expands and companies providing technical professional and construction services are required to compete against each other across geographic boundaries the company that can provide its clients with cost efficient solutions to their project needs has the advantage our attention to cost control throughout every level of our organization allows us to deliver superior technical professional and construction services safely efficiently and within the cost and time parameters our clients require 

  

organizational structure 

our organizational structure and integrated system for delivering our services is another key component of our business strategy our operating units use a matrix organizational structure whereby our project management functions are supported by our various technical engineering design and construction disciplines that are necessary to effectively execute longterm engineering and construction contracts crucial functions such as project controls and procurement are local to each of our major offices and serve operations by providing specialized services required by projects in addition we actively employ a boundaryless approach to the way we serve our clients our operating groups do not compete against each other for contracts rather our organizational structure encourages our operating groups to work cohesively while simultaneously helping to reduce costs and promote an efficient delivery system for all of our services 

  

safety 

the final key component of our business strategy is our intense and uncompromising focus on safety maintaining safe work environments has long been a mutual and unequivocal condition of the relationship we have with our employees it is also a paramount issue in our dealings with our clients a safe work environment is critical to our longterm success and growth we maintain a centralized quality and safety group to help ensure that the services we provide are delivered safely and in accordance with standard work processes unsafe job sites and office environments increase employee turnover increase the cost of a project to our clients and raise our operating costs as well safe job sites and office environments on the other hand benefit our clients promote employee morale and enhance the longterm relationships we have with our clients employees and business partners 

  

the role of acquisitions in our business strategy 

our relationshipbased business model is a significant driver of our acquisition activities when we review potential acquisition targets we are conscious of the effect the acquisition will have on our client base we favor acquisitions that allow us to expand or enhance the range of services we provide our clients andor gain access to new geographic areas in which our clients either already operate or plan to expand by expanding into new geographic areas and adding to our existing technical and project management capabilities we strive to position ourselves as a preferred singlesource provider of technical professional and construction services to our major clients the following is a brief description of some of our key mergers and acquisitions over the past few years 

  

   

   

page 3 

   

   

   

services provided 

as we discuss above our business is to provide technical professional and construction services the services we provide generally fall into four broad categories project services which includes engineering design architectural and similar services construction services operations and maintenance services and process scientific and systems consulting services the scope of services we can provide our clients therefore ranges from consulting and conceptual design services which clients often require in the very early stages of a project to complete singleresponsibility designbuildoperate contracts 

  

the following table sets forth our revenues from each of our four service categories for each of the five fiscal years ended september 30 in thousands of dollars 

  

   

project services 

we employ all of the engineering design architectural and related disciplines needed to design and engineer modern process plants including projects for clients in the chemicals and polymers 

  

page 4 

pharmaceuticals and biotechnology oil  gas refining food and consumer products and basic resources industries buildings including facilities in the health care education and criminal justice markets as well as other buildings for clients in the private sector infrastructure projects including highways roads bridges and other transportation systems and facilities technology and manufacturing facilities for clients in the semiconductor electronics automotive aerospace and defense industries pulp and paper plants and other facilities we also employ many of the requisite scientific technical and program management capabilities necessary to provide program integration testing and evaluation services for clients in the defense and aerospace industries for the united states department of defense “dod” in support of information systems for weapons acquisition centers and for various agencies of the united states federal government in support of environmental programs 

  

we are capable of providing our clients with a variety of value engineering services including “safety in design” through safety in design we integrate best practices hazard analysis and risk assessment methods early in the design phase of projects taking those steps necessary to eliminate or mitigate injury and damage during the construction startup testing and commissioning and operations phases of a project 

  

in the area of construction management we provide our clients with a wide range of services as an agent for our clients we may act as the program director whereby we oversee on the owner’s behalf the complete planning design and construction phases of the project alternatively our services may be limited to providing construction consulting 

  

also included in the category of “project services” are construction related services such as cost engineering planning scheduling procurement estimating project accounting and quality and safety necessary to support our engineering design construction construction and program management operations and maintenance and consulting services 

  

construction 

we provide traditional field construction services to private and public sector clients in virtually all of the industries to which we provide project services we also provide many of our clients with modular construction technology our modular approach is an advanced form of offsite engineering and design fabrication assembly and field erection a modular approach provides clients with an alternative approach to traditional methods of engineering and construction which can compress and shorten the construction schedule in the environmental area we provide environmental remedial construction services for a variety of public and private sector clients 

  

historically our field construction activities have focused primarily on those construction projects for which we perform much of the related engineering and design work by focusing our construction efforts on such projects we minimize the risks associated with constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared by third parties the financial risk to us of constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared by third parties may be particularly significant on fixedprice contracts therefore we generally avoid these projects however we continue to pursue constructiononly projects where we can negotiate pricing and other acceptable contract terms 

  

operations and maintenance “om” 

om generally refers to all of the tasks required to operate and maintain large complex facilities on behalf of clients in such situations we can provide key management and support services over all of the facility’s operations including subcontractors and other onsite personnel within the environmental area om often includes engineering and technical support services as well as program management services necessary to remediate contaminated sites within the aerospace and defense areas om often requires us to provide the management and technical support services 

  

page 5 

necessary to operate and maintain engine test facilities weapons integration and hightech simulation and verification centers such om contracts also frequently require us to provide facilities management and maintenance services utilities operations and maintenance services property management and disposition service and construction support services 

  

this category also includes plant maintenance services which generally involve the tasks required to keep a plant typically a refinery or chemical plant in daytoday operation this includes the repair and replacement of pumps piping heat exchangers and other equipment as well as “turnaround” work which involves major refurbishment that can only be performed when the plant is shut down since shutdowns are expensive to the owners of the plant turnaround work often requires maximizing the number of skilled craft personnel that can work efficiently on a project on a 24hoursperday sevendaysperweek basis we use sophisticated computer scheduling and programming to complete turnaround projects quickly and we maintain contact with a large pool of skilled craft personnel we can hire as needed on maintenance and turnaround projects 

  

although the gross profit margins that we realize from om services are generally lower than those associated with the other services we provide the costs to support maintenance activities are also generally lower furthermore om contracts present less financial risks to us since they are normally costreimbursable in nature additionally although engineering and construction projects may be of a shortterm nature om services often result in longterm relationships with clients for example we have been providing maintenance services at several major process plants for over 30 years this aspect of maintenance services greatly reduces the selling costs in respect of such services 

  

process scientific and systems consulting 

we employ all of the professional and technical expertise necessary to provide a broad range of consulting services including performing pricing studies market analyses and financial projections necessary in determining the feasibility of a project performing gasoline reformulation modeling analyzing and evaluating layout and mechanical designs for complex processing plants analyzing automation and control systems analyzing designing and executing biocontainment strategies developing and performing process protocols with respect to federal drug administrationmandated qualification and validation requirements providing consultation on proposed railway and airport expansion projects and performing geological and metallurgical studies 

  

also included in the category of “process scientific and systems consulting” are the professional and program management services required to assist clients such as the united states federal government and its agencies in a wide range of defense and aerospace related programs such services typically are more technical and scientific in nature than are other project services we provide and may involve such tasks as supporting the development and testing of conventional weapons systems weapons modeling and simulations computer systems development maintenance and support evaluation and testing of missioncritical control systems and other highly technical programs and tasks 

  

complementary nature of resources and business systems utilized 

there is a high degree of similarity of the workforces among our service categories for example engineering and design services ie services provided by persons who are degreed and in certain circumstances licensed such as engineers architects scientists and economists exist in all four service categories in addition there is a high degree of similarity among a significant component of the workforces we employ to perform on om and construction projects in providing om and construction services we employ a large number of skilled craft labor personnel these include welders pipe fitters electricians crane operators and other personnel that work on very large capital projects in the case of projects classified within the construction services category or on smaller capital projects in the case of maintenance projects classified within the om services category 

  

page 6 

our operating units use a matrix organizational structure our results therefore are dependent on groups representing technical disciplines eg cost engineering electrical engineering mechanical engineering supporting project management personnel who maintain the relationship between us and our clients and who are ultimately responsible for delivering projects to our clients safely on time and on budget additionally all of our operating regions and divisions use common tools policies and procedures to manage and run their respective businesses these include practices concerning such things as project review meetings project performance evaluations and project execution plans 

  

the use of technology throughout our organization is highly uniform whether it is pcbased computer aided design and drafting “cadd” applications used by our engineering and design staff or pcbased modeling programs used by the scientific and consulting staff or pcbased scheduling estimating and cost control applications used by homeoffice personnel in support of our construction and maintenance activities all of the service categories described above are equally vulnerable to changes in technology as they occur in the economy at large 

  

industry groups and markets 

we focus our services on clients that operate in the following industry groups and markets oil and gas exploration production and refining united states federal programs pharmaceuticals and biotechnology chemicals and polymers buildings both public and private sector infrastructure technology and manufacturing and pulp and paper we also provide services to clients in other industries and markets such as food and consumer products and basic resources eg mining minerals and fertilizers among others we believe these industry groups and markets have sufficient common needs to permit crossutilization of our resources and help to mitigate the negative effects of a downturn in a single industry 

  

the following table sets forth our revenues from each of these industry groups and markets for each of the five fiscal years ended september 30 in thousands of dollars

historically revenues from our hydrocarbon business related primarily to projects associated with petroleum refining and the processes and technologies required for the conversion of crude oil 

  

page 7 

and gas into petroleum fuels chemical feedstocks and lubricants more recently and particularly in connection with the acquisitions of stork and delta our services and the types of projects we perform have expanded to include the upstream and downstream sectors of the oil and gas industry these projects include heavy oil processing projects eg tar sands extraction projects projects involving oil recovery through steam injection and gas treating gas gathering and gas storage projects including extraction of commercially valuable elements of the gas stream 

  

government regulations often influence the volume of business activity in this market group certain regulations are stimulating need for project services by companies in the refining industry the requirement for lower sulfur fuels drives numerous awards for tier ii gasoline and ultra low sulfur diesel projects additionally consent decrees between the us environmental protection agency “epa” and various refining companies are resulting in additional project services work for us particularly for nitrous oxide nox emission reductions we are actively involved in such regulatorybased projects 

  

we have also used our modular construction capabilities on a number of projects in the refining and petroleum industry in the us and european refining markets many projects involve the revamp of existing processing units or the addition of new processes to an existing refinery as a result of the close proximity of processing units in these refineries we believe the use of modular construction can decrease congestion at the construction site modular construction can also provide cost and project execution benefits in remote locations 

  

we provide maintenance services to our clients in the refining industry we have also established a number of formal alliances with various clients in the refining industry some of these alliances are both domestic us and international in scope 

  

also included in this revenue category are power generation and cogeneration power projects while this is not a major focus for us we provide design engineering procurement construction and construction management and maintenance services to our clients in the power generation and supply industry typical projects in this area include simple and combined cycle power projects cogeneration power plants aeroderivative and industrial gas turbines and emergency power generation stations

pulp and paper projects encompass many areas of a mill including pulping and bleaching papermaking chemical recovery material handling and power and steam generation in the area of papermaking our expertise includes tissue and towel coated and uncoated fine papers newsprint and linerboard our expertise and skill set also include the converting and packaging of paper products for distribution and consumer use we have been instrumental in the design and installation of stateoftheart facilities for recycled fiber deinking and pulp bleaching chemical recovery and power generation are also integral components of the papermaking process we have broad experience in these areas and have applied our expertise in the engineering and construction of such facilities for clients in the pulp and paper industry 

  

a significant portion of our work relates to assisting our clients in their compliance with environmental regulations and standards that affect the pulp and paper industry we monitor all of the key environmental regulations affecting our clients and offer services including compliance studies permitting support and design of pollution control systems we provide fully integrated services ranging from strategic studies and conceptual designs to total installed cost estimates and environmental design services in support of our clients’ projects we also provide complete permitting services in support of all of our projects including associated air modeling as an example of this integrated service approach to projects we were recently awarded a job with an international manufacturer of pulp and paper products our charge is to develop a compliance plan for the us epa cluster rule at multiple sites we will support our clients’ internal capital appropriation processes and then provide detailed design services our management of this program should allow our client to control the emission of methanol and total reduced sulfide gases and comply with the epa standard for hazardous air pollutants from kraft pulp mills we are also providing similar services for compliance with criteria air pollutant standards and hazardous air pollutant emission limits from industrial boilers for many of our clients 

  

like certain other markets we have established formal alliances with various clients in the pulp and paper industry such alliances have allowed us to expand the types of services we provide our clients while improving the overall quality and consistency of the engineering procurement construction construction management and maintenance services that our clients receive 

  

other 

included in “other” are projects not classified into any of the other industry and market categories this would include projects for clients in food and consumer products as well as basic resources such as mining minerals and fertilizers among other industries and markets

revenues from operations outside the united states 

for the fiscal years ended september 30 2003 2002 2001 2000 and 1999 revenues from operations outside the united states comprised approximately 353 333 223 164 and 158 respectively of total revenues for fiscal 1999 substantially all such foreign revenues related to our offices in the united kingdom ireland france spain and italy with a small portion relating to our operations in india as a result of the acquisition of the stork ec businesses parts of which we completed in fiscal 2000 and fiscal 2001 we expanded our european operations into the netherlands belgium and germany and we acquired operations in southeast asia as a result of the acquisition of the gibb businesses which we completed in fiscal 2001 we further expanded our operations in the united kingdom and acquired businesses in other european countries finally as a result of the acquisition of delta completed in october 2001 we further expanded our business in north america to include canada although we have foreign operations located elsewhere around the world in addition to those in europe canada and asia revenues earned over the past five years from these other operations were not material 

  

contracts 

while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the contracts we undertake our contracts generally fall into three broad categories costreimbursable fixedprice and guaranteed maximum price the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues represented by these types of contracts during each of the five preceding fiscal years ended september 30 

  

   

in accordance with industry practice most of our contracts are subject to termination at the discretion of the client contracts typically provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through the date of such termination 

  

when we are directly responsible for engineering design procurement and construction of a project or the maintenance of a client’s plant or facility we reflect the costs of materials equipment and subcontracts in both revenues and costs on other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly these amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs the following table presents the approximate amount of such passthrough costs included in revenues for each of the five preceding fiscal years ended september 30 in millions 

  

   

costreimbursable contracts 

costreimbursable contracts generally provide for reimbursement of costs incurred plus an amount of profit the profit element may be in the form of a simple markup applied to the labor costs incurred on a contract or it may be in the form of a fee or a combination of a markup and a fee the fee element can also take several forms the fee may be a fixed amount as specified in the contract it may be an amount based on a percentage of the costs incurred or it may be an incentive fee based on targets milestones or performance factors defined in the contract in general we prefer costreimbursable contracts because we believe the primary reason for awarding a contract to us should be our technical expertise and professional qualifications rather than price 

  

page 14 

fixedprice contracts 

fixedprice contracts include both “negotiated fixedprice” contracts and “lump sum bid” contracts under a negotiated fixedprice contract we are selected as the contractor first and then we negotiate a price with our client negotiated fixedprice contracts frequently exist in singleresponsibility arrangements where we perform some portion of the work before negotiating the total price of the project under lump sum bid contracts we are required to bid against other contractors based on specifications the client furnishes this type of pricing presents certain inherent risks that are reduced by the negotiation process including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period thus although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client the lump sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to us however because of economies that may be realized during the contract term both negotiated fixedprice and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit potential than the other types of contracts over the past five years most of our fixedprice work has been either negotiated fixedprice contracts or lump sum bid contracts for project services rather than turn key construction 

  

guaranteed maximum price contracts 

guaranteed maximum price “gmax” contracts are performed in the same manner as costreimbursable contracts however the total actual cost plus the fee cannot exceed the guaranteed price negotiated with the client if the total actual cost of the contract exceeds the guaranteed maximum price then we will bear at least some if not all of the excess in those cases where the total actual cost and fee are less than the guaranteed price we will often share the savings on a predetermined basis with the client these contracts are not our preferred form of contract because they often contribute to an adversarial relationship with clients which is contrary to our relationshipbased business model 

  

competition 

we engage in a highly competitive business some of our competitors are larger than us or are subsidiaries of larger companies and therefore may possess greater resources than we do furthermore because the technical professional aspects of our business do not usually require large amounts of capital there is relative ease of market entry for a new potential entrant possessing acceptable professional qualifications accordingly we compete with regional national and international firms within any specific geographic area certain competitors including regional competitors may possess greater resources than we do 

  

the extent of our competition varies according to the industries and markets we serve as well as the geographic areas in which we operate our largest competitors for engineering construction and maintenance services for process plants include bechtel group inc fluor corporation foster wheeler corp kellogg brown  root aker kvaerner technip and amec plc in the area of buildings our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as hdr inc hellmuth obata  kassabaum aecom technology turner construction and day  zimmermann in the area of infrastructure our competitors include several of the competitors previously mentioned as well as parsons brinckerhoff urs corporation hntb and ws atkins in the area of pulp and paper our principal competitors include bek and amec plc and in the area of us federal programs our principal competitors include several of the companies listed above as well as the shaw group montgomery watson saic ch2m hill roy f weston lockheed martin corporation and computer sciences corporation 

  

employees 

at september 30 2003 we had approximately 21100 fulltime staff employees including contract staff additionally as of september 30 2003 there were approximately 12600 persons

in addition to these properties we lease smaller project offices located throughout the united states and in certain other countries around the world we maintain sales offices at many of our principal locations the majority of our offices and locations are leased we also rent a portion of our construction equipment on a shortterm basis 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

in the normal course of business we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation generally such guarantees relate to project schedules and plant performance most of the litigation involves us as a defendant in workers’ compensation personal injury environmental environmental exposure professional liability and other similar lawsuits in addition as a contractor for many agencies of the united states government we are subject to many levels of audits investigations and claims by or on behalf of the government with respect to contract performance pricing costs cost allocations and procurement practices our income franchise and similar tax returns and filings are also subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service most states within the united states as well as by various government agencies representing jurisdictions outside the united states within which we operate 

  

management believes after consultation with counsel that such guarantees litigation united states government contractrelated audits investigations and claims and income tax audits and investigations should not have any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in addition to the matters described above we are involved in a dispute with a client relating to a large waste incineration project in europe the contract was entered into by one of our subsidiaries several years ago prior to the acquisition of that subsidiary the dispute involves proper waste feed content of residues final acceptance of the plant and costs of operation and maintenance of the plant we have initiated litigation against the client and are seeking in excess of 400 million in damages we believe our claims are valid and enforceable and that we will be ultimately successful in obtaining a favorable judgment

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and 

results of operations 

  

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of any business entity performing longterm engineering and constructiontype contracts requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect both the entity’s results of operations as well as the carrying values of its assets and liabilities although our significant accounting polices are described in note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the following discussion is intended to describe those accounting policies most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

page 19 

revenue accounting for contracts —in accounting for longterm engineering and constructiontype contracts we follow the provisions of the aicpa’s statement of position 811— accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts  in general we recognize revenues at the time we provide services depending on the commercial terms of the contracts we recognize revenues either when costs are incurred or using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion contract losses are provided for in their entirety in the period they become known without regard to the percentageofcompletion 

  

the nature of our business results in clients subcontractors or vendors occasionally presenting claims against us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur or for which they believe they are not contractually responsible similarly and in the normal course of business we may present claims to our clients for costs we have incurred for which we believe we are not contractually responsible in those situations where a claim against us may result in additional costs to the contract we would include in the total estimated costs of the contract and therefore the estimated amount of margin to be earned under the contract an estimate based on the relevant facts and circumstances available of the additional costs to be incurred in those situations where we have incurred additional costs for which we believe the client is contractually responsible we may present a claim to the client for such costs we will include in revenues the amount of costs incurred without profit to the extent it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue and the amount of such additional revenue can be reliably estimated costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in revenues using substantially the same criteria used for claims 

  

certain costreimbursable contracts with the us federal government as well as certain commercial clients provide that contract costs are subject to audit and adjustment in this situation revenues are recorded at the time services are performed based upon the amounts we expect to realize upon completion of the contracts in those situations where an audit indicates that we may have billed a client for costs not allowable under the terms of the contract we will estimate the amount of such nonbillable costs and adjust our revenues accordingly 

  

as is common in the industry we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through partnerships and joint ventures for certain of these contracts ie where we have an undivided interest in the assets and liabilities of the venture we recognize our proportionate share of joint venture revenues costs and operating profit in our consolidated statement of earnings for other investments in engineering and construction joint ventures we use the equity method of accounting 

  

insurance matters litigation claims and contingencies —in the normal course of business we are subject to certain contractual guarantees and litigation generally such guarantees relate to project schedules and plant performance most of the litigation involves the company as a defendant in workers’ compensation personal injury environmental environmental exposure professional liability and other similar lawsuits we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations however we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles limits and retentions under our insurance programs this situation may subject us to some future liability for which we are only partially insured or completely uninsured additionally our income franchise and similar tax returns and filings are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service most states in the united states as well as by various government agencies representing jurisdictions outside the united states in which we operate 

  

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 5— accounting for contingencies  we record in our consolidated balance sheets amounts representing our estimated liability relating to such claims guarantees litigation and audits and investigations we rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in determining the level of reserves to establish for both insurance 

  

page 20 

related claims that are known and have been asserted against us as well as for insurancerelated claims that are believed to have been incurred based on actuarial analysis but have not yet been reported to our claims administrators as of the respective balance sheet dates we include any adjustments to such insurance reserves in our consolidated results of operations 

  

testing goodwill for impairment —in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 —goodwill and other intangible assets “sfas 142” the amount of goodwill carried on our consolidated balance sheet is tested annually for possible impairment in conducting the impairment test we may apply in accordance with the provisions of sfas 142 various techniques to estimate the fair value of our reporting units these techniques are inherently subjective and the resulting values are not necessarily representative of the values we might obtain in a sale of our reporting units to a willing third party since the adoption of sfas 142 in fiscal 2002 we have not recorded any impairment loss associated with our goodwill 

  

operations outside the united states —in general our principal exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar into the us dollar we follow the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 52— foreign currency translation in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

  

we believe our exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because our various operations invoice clients and satisfy their financial obligations primarily in their respective local currencies in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currencies we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs 

  

accounting for pensions 

as more fully explained in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we sponsor various defined benefit pension plans the one remaining us pension plan which was acquired in connection with our 1999 merger with sverdrup corporation was frozen in 1999 allowing no new participants to enter our other pension plans cover employees of certain of our international subsidiaries we account for these plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 87— employers’ accounting for pensions sfas 87 requires the use of assumptions and estimates in order to calculate periodic pension cost and the value of the plans’ assets and liabilities these assumptions involve discount rates investment returns and projected salary increases among others we rely on qualified actuaries to assist us in valuing the financial position of the plans and to provide advice regarding the actuarial assumptions used during fiscal 2003 we reduced our expected rate of return on plan assets from a range of 8 to 95 in fiscal 2002 to a range of 8 to 9 in fiscal 2003 we believe this reduction better reflects the longterm returns expected on the plans’ assets considering projected rates of inflation the diversification of the plans’ assets and the expected real rates of market returns changes in the actuarial assumptions may have a material affect on the plans’ assets and liabilities and the associated pension expense management together with our actuaries monitors trends in the marketplace within which our pension plans operate in order to assure the fairness of the actuarial assumptions used 

  

also discussed in note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements is our obligation to form a pension plan and an earlyretirement plan “vut” for substantially all of our employees located in the netherlands these plans will replace existing programs sponsored by stork nv when the replacement plans are designed and formed we will negotiate with both stork nv and the trustees of the existing multiemployer plans to set a value of the assets to be transferred into the replacement plans although we have not finalized the design of the replacement pension and vut plans we 

  

page 21 

expect that the value of the assets that will be transferred will be less than the value of the benefit obligations we will agree to assume such “prior service cost” will be amortized against earnings over the future estimated service period of our employees in the netherlands 

  

results of operations 

our business is focused exclusively on providing technical professional and construction services to a large number of industrial commercial and governmental clients around the world the services we provide generally fall into four broad categories project services which includes engineering design architectural and similar services construction services which includes revenues earned from traditional field construction activities as well as modular construction activities operations and maintenance “om” services which includes revenues from contracts requiring us to operate and maintain large complex facilities on behalf of clients as well as contracts involving process plant maintenance services and activities and process scientific and systems consulting services which includes revenues earned from providing a wide variety of scientific and consulting services to clients 

  

the scope of services we can provide our clients therefore ranges from consulting and conceptual design services which are often required by clients in the very early stages of a project to complete singleresponsibility designbuildoperate contracts 

  

the following table sets forth our revenues by type of service for each year ended september 30 in thousands 

  

   

beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2002 we classify certain elements of revenues as construction that were classified previously as project services consequently we reclassified approximately 1104 million of project services revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2002 to construction revenues revenues for fiscal 2001 have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2002 and 2003 presentation 

  

we focus our services on certain industry groups and markets that we believe have sufficient common needs to permit crossutilization of our resources the following table sets forth our revenues by these industry groups and markets for each year ended september 30 in thousands 

  

   

“other” includes projects for clients operating in a number of industries including food and consumer products and basic resources such as mining minerals and fertilizers

fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 

we recorded net earnings of 1280 million or 227 per diluted share for fiscal year ended september 30 2003 compared to net earnings of 1097 million or 198 per diluted share for fiscal 2002 

  

total revenues for fiscal 2003 increased by 599 million or 13 to 46 billion compared to fiscal 2002 our revenues were relatively flat during the current fiscal year primarily attributable to a 1524 million or 99 decline in passthrough costs the amount of passthrough costs included in revenues during fiscal 2003 totaled 14 billion compared to 15 billion during fiscal 2002 the level of passthrough costs included in revenues and costs will vary between reporting periods depending principally on the amount of procurement that clients choose to do themselves as opposed to using our services as well as on the normal winding down of field services activities on construction and om projects see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of passthrough costs 

  

as a percentage of revenues direct costs of contracts were 864 for fiscal 2003 compared to 872 for fiscal 2002 the percentage relationship between direct costs of contracts and revenues will fluctuate between reporting periods depending on a variety of factors including the mix of business during the reporting periods being compared as well as the level of margins earned from the various types of services provided 

  

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for fiscal 2003 increased by 175 million or 42 to 4288 million compared to 4113 million for fiscal 2002 the increase in sga expenses included the impact of the operations of mcdermott engineers  constructors canada limited including delta catalytic and delta hudson engineering collectively “delta” for a full twelve months in the current fiscal year compared to only eleven months in fiscal 2002 since we completed the acquisition of delta on october 31 2001 had delta’s operations been included for a full twelve months for fiscal 2002 sga expenses would have been higher by an additional 09 million as a percentage of revenues consolidated sga expenses increased to 93 in fiscal 2003 compared to 90 in fiscal 2002 management continues efforts to tighten controls over discretionary spending 

  

despite a relatively flat revenue stream during fiscal 2003 our operating profit defined as revenues less direct costs of contracts and sga expenses increased by 247 million or 144 to 1971 million compared to 1724 million during fiscal 2002 as a percentage of revenues operating profit increased to 43 in fiscal 2003 compared to 38 in fiscal 2002 the increase in our operating profit was due primarily to improved margins 

  

interest expense decreased by 42 million or 566 to 33 million in fiscal 2003 compared to 75 million in fiscal 2002 due to significantly reduced borrowing levels in august 2003 we entered into a new five year 2900 million unsecured revolving bank credit agreement and terminated the existing revolving credit facilities that had an aggregate borrowing capacity of 2750 million the previous facilities that were replaced were scheduled to expire in january 2004 amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facilities totaled 178 million bearing interest of 29 at september 30 2003 compared to 857 million bearing interest of 38 at september 30 2002 see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our borrowings 

  

we recorded income tax expense of 689 million and 591 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002 respectively our overall effective tax rate was 350 for both fiscal 2003 and 2002 

  

fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 

on april 1 2002 we completed a twoforone stock split which was distributed in the form of a 100 stock dividend to stockholders of record on march 1 2002 see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the stock split transaction 

  

page 23 

on october 31 2001 we completed the acquisition of delta as more fully explained in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements delta provides engineering construction and maintenance services to clients in a variety of industries with significant revenues attributable to clients in the upstream oil and gas petroleum refining energy and other industries 

  

during fiscal 2001 we completed the purchase from lawgibb group inc of substantially all of its international engineering and construction management business the “gibb” businesses and finalized the second phase of the twopart transaction to acquire from stork nv the netherlands certain engineering and contracting businesses “stork phase ii” see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the stork and gibb transactions our operating results for fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 were not significantly impacted by the operations of gibb and stock phase ii 

  

we recorded net earnings of 1097 million or 198 per diluted share for the fiscal year ended september 30 2002 compared to net earnings of 878 million or 161 per diluted share for fiscal 2001 

  

effective october 1 2001 we eliminated the amortization of goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142— goodwill and other intangible assets  our results of operations for prior years have not been restated goodwill amortization on a pretax basis was 76 million 49 million aftertax in fiscal 2001 see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of sfas 142 

  

total revenues for fiscal 2002 increased by 5987 million or 151 to 46 billion compared to total revenues of 40 billion in fiscal 2001 approximately 124 or 5641 million of revenues in fiscal 2002 were generated by delta’s operations 

  

sga expenses for fiscal 2002 increased by 505 million or 140 to 4113 million compared to 3608 million for fiscal 2001 the increase in sga expenses during fiscal 2002 reflects the inclusion of the operations of delta gibb and stork phase ii which contributed a combined total of 402 million to sga expenses excluding the impact of the delta and gibb acquisitions and the impact of eliminating goodwill amortization in fiscal 2002 sga expenses increased by 316 million or 93 in fiscal 2002 as a percentage of revenues consolidated sga expenses was 90 in fiscal 2002 compared to 91 in fiscal 2001 

  

during fiscal 2002 our operating profit increased by 285 million or 198 to 1724 million compared to 1439 million in fiscal 2001 the increase in our operating profit for fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was due primarily to increases in business volume combined with the elimination of goodwill amortization and with keeping direct costs of contracts and sga expenses as percentages of revenues at approximately the same levels as fiscal 2001 operating profit was 38 of revenues in fiscal 2002 compared to 36 of revenues in fiscal 2001 excluding the impact of goodwill amortization our operating profit would have been 38 of revenues in fiscal 2001 

  

during fiscal 2002 interest expense decreased by 42 million or 360 to 75 million compared to interest expense of 117 million during fiscal 2001 the decrease in interest expense was due to significantly reduced borrowing levels at september 30 2002 we had total debt of 917 million compared to 1840 million at september 30 2001 we financed the delta acquisition in october 2001 with a new shortterm 500 million credit facility by september 2002 we had converted this credit facility to a longterm 450 million facility due in january 2004 at september 30 2002 this longterm facility had an outstanding balance of 281 million bearing interest of 34 at september 30 2002 and 2001 outstanding borrowings and the associated interest rates under the 2300 million revolving credit facility were 576 million bearing interest of 40 and 1643 million bearing interest of 41 respectively see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our borrowings 

  

page 24 

we recorded income tax expense of 591 million and 504 million in fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively our overall effective tax rate was 350 for fiscal 2002 compared to an effective tax rate of 365 for fiscal 2001 

  

backlog 

backlog represents the total dollar amount of revenues we expect to record in the future as a result of performing work under contracts that have been awarded to us our policy with respect to om contracts however is to include in backlog the amount of revenues we expect to receive for one succeeding year regardless of the remaining life of the contract for federal programs other than federal om contracts our policy is to include in backlog the full contract award whether funded or unfunded and exclude option periods 

  

in accordance with industry practice substantially all of our contracts are subject to cancellation or termination at the option of the client however we have not experienced cancellations that have had a material effect on the reported backlog amounts in a situation where a client terminates a contract we would ordinarily be entitled to receive payment for work performed up to the date of termination and in certain instances we may be entitled to allowable termination and cancellation costs while management uses all information available to it to determine backlog our backlog at any given time is subject to changes in the scope of services to be provided as well as increases or decreases in costs relating to the contracts included therein 

  

the following table summarizes our total backlog at september 30 2003 2002 and 2001 in millions 

  

   

in fiscal 2002 we began classifying as “field services” backlog certain engineering and scientific and systems consulting activities relating to operations and maintenance contracts that had been classified previously as “technical professional services” backlog backlog for fiscal years 2001 has been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2002 presentation 

  

total backlog at september 30 2003 included approximately 19 billion or 277 of total backlog relating to work to be performed either directly or indirectly for the us federal government and its agencies this compares to approximately 18 billion or 276 and 19 billion or 324 of us federal backlog at september 30 2002 and 2001 respectively most of our federal contracts extend beyond one year in general these contracts must be funded annually ie the amounts to be spent under the contract must be appropriated by congress to the procuring agency and then the agency must allot these sums to the specific contracts 

  

our backlog for fiscal 2003 increased by 3668 million or 55 to 70 billion compared to fiscal 2002 and increased in fiscal 2002 by 7617 million or 129 to 67 billion compared to fiscal 2001 the increase in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was attributable primarily to new awards from clients in the oil  gas and refining industries combined with new us federal program awards the increase in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 was also attributable primarily to oil  gas and refining backlog added as a result of the delta acquisition also contributing to the increase in backlog from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 were new awards in both the civil and infrastructure and the us federal programs sectors of our business 

  

we estimate that approximately 29 billion or 415 of total backlog at september 30 2003 will be realized as revenues within the next fiscal year

during fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 approximately 82 85 and 81 respectively of our consolidated revenues were realized from costreimbursable type contracts because a significant portion of our revenues continues to be earned under costreimbursable type contracts the effects of inflation on our financial condition and results of operations continue to be generally low however as we expand our business into markets and geographic areas where fixedprice and lumpsum work is more prevalent inflation may have a larger impact on our results of operations in the future to the extent permitted by competition we intend to continue to emphasize contracts which are either costreimbursable or negotiated fixedprice for contracts with fixedprice and lumpsum terms we closely monitor the actual costs on the project as compared to the original estimates on these projects we also attempt to secure fixedprice commitments from key subcontractors and vendors however due to the competitive nature of our business combined with the fluctuating demands and prices associated with personnel equipment and materials we traditionally need in order to perform on our contracts there can be no guarantee that inflation will not affect our results of operations in the future 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

we finance our operations primarily through cash provided by operations at september 30 2003 our principal source of liquidity consisted of 1262 million of cash and cash equivalents and a new fiveyear 2900 million revolving credit facility discussed below 

  

during fiscal 2003 our cash and cash equivalents increased by 777 million to 1262 million this compares to a net decrease of 08 million to 485 million during fiscal 2002 and to a net decrease of 166 million to 493 million during fiscal 2001 during fiscal 2003 we experienced net cash inflows from operating activities and the effect on cash of exchange rate changes of 1475 million and 28 million respectively these inflows were offset by net cash outflows from investing and financing activities of 177 million and 550 million respectively 

  

our operations provided net cash of 1475 million during fiscal 2003 this compares to net cash inflows of 1608 million and 151 million during fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively the 132 million decrease in cash provided by operations in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was due primarily to a decrease in inflows of 391 million relating to the timing of cash receipts and payments within our working capital accounts partially offset by an increase in net earnings of 183 million and an increase in inflows relating to deferred income taxes of 67 million in determining the amount we fund our defined benefit pension plans we consider various factors including the minimum amounts required under applicable law the tax deductibility of any contribution we make and the effect of the funding on the future returns on plan assets although management continues to evaluate and monitor our future funding options and requirements we expect the funding amounts to range from approximately 61 million in fiscal 2004 to 133 million in fiscal 2006 

  

the net cash we used for investing activities was 177 million during fiscal 2003 this compares to net cash outflows of 925 million and 636 million during fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively the net decrease of 749 million in cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was due primarily to a decrease of 435 million in net cash used for acquisitions a net decrease in other noncurrent assets of 210 million a decrease in additions to property and equipment of 114 million and an increase of 39 million in proceeds from sales of investments these inflows were partially offset by an increase of 29 million in purchases of investments and a decrease in disposals of property and equipment of 21 million 

  

our financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 550 million during fiscal 2003 this compares to net cash outflows of 647 million and net cash inflows of 322 million during fiscal 2002 and 2001 respectively the 97 million net decrease in cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was due primarily to decreases in repayments of longterm 

  

page 26 

borrowings and purchases of common stock for treasury of 3642 million and 20 million respectively and an increase of 62 million in proceeds from issuance of common stock these inflows were partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from longterm borrowings of 2427 million and a net reduction in shortterm borrowings of 1048 million our total borrowing activity for fiscal 2003 resulted in net repayments of 770 million compared to net repayments of 936 million in fiscal 2002 and net additional borrowings of 171 million in fiscal 2001 

  

we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations and service our debt for the foreseeable future at september 30 2003 we had 1262 million in cash and cash equivalents and a consolidated working capital position of 3587 million at september 30 2002 we had 485 million in cash and cash equivalents and a consolidated working capital position of 2345 million on august 20 2003 we signed a new fiveyear 2900 million unsecured revolving bank credit agreement and terminated all existing revolving credit facilities the previous revolving credit facilities had an aggregate borrowing capacity of 2750 million and were scheduled to expire in january 2004 management believes that the capacity terms and conditions of the new facility will be sufficient for the company’s working capital and general business requirements we also have 461 million available through committed shortterm credit facilities at september 30 2003 05 million and 178 million were outstanding in the form of direct borrowings under the 461 million and 2900 credit facilities respectively see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on our borrowings 

  

under our stock repurchase program we are authorized by our board of directors to buyback up to 60 million shares of the common stock of the company in the open market repurchases of common stock are financed from existing credit facilities and available cash balances from inception of the program through september 30 2002 we have repurchased a total of 3732400 shares of common stock in the open market at a total cost of 590 million no shares of common stock were repurchased during fiscal 2003 substantially all shares of common stock held in treasury were eventually reissued for our employee stock purchase and incentive stock plans 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

in november 2002 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued interpretation no 45— guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others —“fin 45” fin 45 requires that upon issuance of a guarantee the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee in addition fin 45 requires additional disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 and the disclosure requirements of fin 45 are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december 15 2002 we adopted the disclosure requirements of fin 45 in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 

  

in december 2002 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 148— accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure “sfas 148” sfas 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to fair value based accounting for stockbased compensation sfas also amends the disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 —accounting for stockbased compensation “sfas 123” by requiring disclosures in both interim and annual financial statements as allowed by sfas 123 we have elected to continue to account for stock issued to our employees and outside directors in accordance with apb opinion no 25— accounting for stock issued to employees “apb 25” we adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas 123 as amended by sfas 148 in the second quarter of fiscal 2003 

  

in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 —consolidation of variable interest entities “fin46” which is an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 51— consolidated 

  

page 27 

financial statements “arb 51” fin 46 requires a variable interest entity “vie” to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if certain criteria are met the provisions of fin 46 were immediately applicable to vies created after january 31 2003 in october 2003 the fasb deferred the effective date of fin 46 for vies created before february 1 2003 to the first reporting period ending after december 15 2003 as is common to the industry we execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through partnerships and joint ventures in general we account for these investments in accordance with emerging issues task force issue 0001— investor balance sheet and income statement display under the equity method for investments in certain partnerships and other ventures “eitf 0001” and aicpa’s statement of position 811— accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts “sop 811” we are a partner in two joint ventures which may require consolidation in accordance with fin 46 the first joint venture provides engineering design construction and construction management services in connection with the upgrade and rehabilitation of a municipal wastewater treatment plant at september 30 2003 this joint venture had total assets and total liabilities of 270 million and 216 million respectively the second joint venture performs capital projects and provides operations services testing analysis and support services to a us military engineering and design center the contract between this second joint venture and the us federal government was not executed until october 2003 and accordingly the assets and liabilities of this second joint venture were not material at september 30 2003 although we continue to evaluate the applicability of fin 46 to our joint ventures we believe that most of our joint ventures are either not vies or if the joint ventures are vies we are not the primary beneficiary 

  

on april 30 2003 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 149— amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities “sfas 149” sfas 149 clarifies and amends financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under statement of accounting standards no 133— accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities “sfas 133” sfas 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified and for hedging relationships designated after june 30 2003 we do not believe that the adoption of sfas 149 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

on may 15 2003 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 150— accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity “sfas 150” sfas 150 establishes standards for classifying and measuring as liabilities certain financial instruments that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity and that have been presented either entirely as equity or between the liabilities section and the equity section of the balance sheet sfas 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 sfas 150 does not have a material impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations 

  

forwardlooking statements 

statements included in this management’s discussion and analysis that are not based on historical facts are “forwardlooking statements” as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 such statements are based on management’s current estimates expectations and projections about the issues discussed the industries in which our clients operate and the services we provides by their nature such forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties we have tried wherever possible to identify such statements by using words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “project” “intend” “plan” “believe” and words and terms of similar substance in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance we caution the reader that a variety of factors could cause business conditions and results to differ materially from what is contained in our forwardlooking statements including the following

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk in the normal course of business our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 

  

interest rate risk 

our only source for longterm credit is a revolving credit agreement for 2900 million the total amounts outstanding under this facility at september 30 2003 was 179 million this agreement expires in august of 2008 and provides for both fixedrate and variablerate borrowings our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we maintain fixed rate debt on a majority of our borrowings and minimize our outstanding borrowings by paying down debt from cash provided from operations 

  

foreign currency risk 

in general our exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating the financial statements of our subsidiaries operating outside the united states which are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar into the us dollar we follow the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 52 – foreign currency translation in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

  

we believe our exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because in general our various operations invoice 

  

page 29 

customers and satisfy their financial obligations in their respective local currencies in situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their own functional currencies we strive to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs

             in fiscal 1999 we completed our merger with the sverdrup
              corporation sverdrup as a result of this transaction
              sverdrup which is headquartered in st louis missouri became a
              whollyowned subsidiary of jacobs sverdrup provides engineering
              architecture construction and scientific services for the
              development design construction and operation of buildings
              infrastructure projects and advanced technical systems for public
              and private sector clients in the united states and
              internationally at the time of the merger sverdrup employed more
              than 5600 people in offices located throughout the united states
              and in selected countries abroad the sverdrup transaction
              expanded our business opportunities in several key markets added
              professional staff as well as presence in new geographies it
              also added civil and defense capabilities to the companys range
              of professional services

             in fiscal 1997 we acquired the serete group of companies the
              acquisition of the serete group which is headquartered in paris
              france provided us with an established business presence in
              france spain and italy the acquisition added professional staff
              and enhanced our existing engineering capabilities this
              transaction also expanded our client base in several key market
              groups

             also in fiscal 1997 the company increased its ownership interest
              and became the majority owner of humphreys  glasgow consultants
              limited which is headquartered in mumbai india through
              humphreys  glasgow consultants limited we gained access to the
              southern asia market expanded our client base and added
              professional staff to the organization

         in addition to the particular advantages described above these mergers
and acquisitions have allowed us to grow our relationships with our major
clients by expanding into new geographic areas and by adding to our existing
technical and project management capabilities we strive to position ourselves
as a preferred singlesource provider of technical professional services to
our major clients

services provided

         as discussed above our business is to provide technical professional
services the services we provide can be generally classified into four broad
categories project services which includes engineering design architectural
and other related services process scientific and systems consulting
services operations and maintenance om services and construction
services the scope of services we can provide our clients therefore range
from consulting services which are often required by clients in the very early
stages of a project to complete singleresponsibility designbuildoperate
contracts

its four service categories for each of the five fiscal years ended september 30

         project services
         
         we employ all of the engineering and related disciplines needed to
design and engineer modern process plants including projects for clients in the
chemicals and polymers pharmaceuticals and biotechnology oil  gas refining
food and consumer products and the basic resources industries industrial and
commercial buildings including facilities in the health care education and
criminal justice markets as well as commercial buildings for clients in the
private sector infrastructure projects including highways roads bridges and
other transportation facilities technology and manufacturing facilities for
clients in the semiconductor electronics automotive aerospace and defense
industries pulp and paper plants and other facilities we also employ many of
the requisite scientific technical and program management capabilities
necessary to provide program integration testing and evaluation services for
clients in the defense and aerospace industries and in support of environmental
programs primarily for agencies of the us federal government

         also included in the category of project services are construction
management services as well as all of the related support services necessary
for the proper and effective delivery of the companys engineering and other
homeoffice services among these are cost engineering planning scheduling
procurement estimating project accounting and quality and safety in the
area of construction management we provide our clients with a wide range of
services as an agent for our clients we may act as the program director
whereby we oversee on behalf of the owner of the project the complete
planning design and construction phases of the project or our services may be
limited to providing construction consulting

         process scientific and systems consulting
         
         we employ all of the professional and technical expertise necessary to
provide a broad range of consulting services including performing pricing
studies market analyses and financial projections necessary in determining the
feasibility of a project performing gasoline reformulation modeling analyzing
and evaluating layout and mechanical designs for complex processing plants
analyzing automation and control systems analyzing designing and executing
biocontainment strategies developing and performing process protocols in
respect of federal drug administration mandated qualificationvalidation
requirements and performing geological and metallurgical studies

         also included in process scientific and systems consulting are the
professional and program management services required in order to assist clients
for example the us federal government and its agencies in a wide range of
defense and aerospace related programs such services typically are more
technical and scientific in nature than are other project services provided by
the company and may involve such tasks as supporting the development and
testing of conventional weapons systems weapons modeling and simulations
computer systems development maintenance and support evaluations and testing
of missioncritical control systems and other highly technical programs and
tasks

         operations  maintenance om
         
         om activities generally refer to all of the tasks required to operate
and maintain large complex facilities on behalf of clients in such situations
we typically provide key management and support services over all of the
facilitys operations including subcontractors and other onsite personnel
within the environmental area om activities often include engineering and
technical support services as well as program management services necessary to
remediate contaminated sites within the aerospace and defense areas om
activities often require us to provide all of the management and technical
support services necessary to operate and maintain engine test facilities
weapons integration and hightech simulation and verification centers such om
contracts also frequently require us to provide facilities management and
maintenance services utilities operations and maintenance services property
management and disposition and construction support services

                                     page 3

        also included in this category are plant maintenance services plant
maintenance services generally involve all of the tasks required to keep a plant
typically a refinery or chemical plant in daytoday operation including the
repair and replacement of pumps piping heat exchangers and other equipment it
also includes turnaround work which involves major refurbishment which can
only be performed when the plant is shut down since shutdowns are expensive to
the owners of the plant turnaround work will often require maximizing the
number of skilled craft personnel that can work efficiently on a project on a 24
hours per day seven days per week basis we utilize sophisticated computer
scheduling and programming to complete turnaround projects quickly and we
maintain contact with a large pool of skilled craft personnel we can hire as
needed on maintenance and turnaround projects

        although the gross profit margins that can be realized from om services
are generally lower than those associated with the other services we provide
the costs to support maintenance activities are also generally lower
furthermore since om contracts are normally costreimbursable in nature they
present less financial risk to the company additionally although engineering
and construction projects may be of a shortterm nature om services often
result in longterm relationships with clients for example the company has
been providing maintenance services at several major process plants for over 30
years this aspect of maintenance services greatly reduces the selling costs in
respect of such services

         construction
         
         we provide traditional field construction services to private and
public sector clients in virtually all of the industries to which we provide
project services we can also provide our clients with advanced construction
technology actr actr is an advanced form of offsite engineering and
design fabrication assembly and field erection actr provides clients with
an alternative approach to traditional methods of engineering and construction
which can compress and shorten the construction schedule as well as help to
reduce costs in the environmental area recent contract awards from clients in
the public sector require us to perform environmental remedial construction
services

         historically the companys field construction activities have been
focused primarily on those construction projects for which we performed the
related engineering and design work by focusing our construction efforts on
such projects we seek to avoid the risk of constructing complex plants and
facilities based on designs prepared by third parties the financial risk to the
company of constructing complex plants and facilities based on designs prepared
by third parties may be particularly significant on fixedprice contracts

         we actively market all of our services to clients for projects where
the scope of services required is within our fields of expertise we believe
that by integrating and bundling our services ie providing design
engineering and construction services on the same project we can price our
services more competitively and can enhance the overall contract profitability
we also believe that clients benefit from such an approach because they can look
to the company as a singlesource provider of designbuild services however we
will continue to pursue constructiononly projects where we can negotiate
pricing and other contract terms we find acceptable

customers


     for the fiscal years ended september 30 2001 2000 1999 1998 and 1997
revenues earned directly or indirectly from agencies of the us federal
government accounted for 173 177 174 121 and 120 respectively of
total revenues due to the amount of passthrough costs see contracts below
that may be incurred on construction and maintenance projects it is not unusual
for a client in the private sector to account for more than 10 of consolidated
revenues in any given year such was the case in fiscal 1997 when one client in
the private sector accounted for 153 of total revenues

foreign operations


     for the fiscal years ended september 30 2001 2000 1999 1998 and 1997
revenues from the companys operations outside the united states comprised
approximately 223 164 158 202 and 235 respectively of total
revenues for fiscal years 1997 through 1999 substantially all such revenues
related to the companys offices in the united kingdom ireland france spain
and italy with a small portion relating to the companys operations in india
as a result of the stork acquisition parts of which were completed in fiscal
2000 and fiscal 2001 we expanded our european operations into the netherlands
belgium and germany and we acquired operations in south east asia as a result
of the gibb acquisition which was completed in fiscal 2001 we further
expanded our business in the united kingdom and acquired operations in the
middle east revenues earned over the past five years from the companys
operations in mexico south america and australia were not material

contracts


     while there is considerable variation in the pricing provisions of the
contracts undertaken by the company our contracts can generally be grouped into
three broad categories costreimbursable fixedprice and guaranteed maximum
price the following table sets forth the percentages of total revenues
represented by these types of contracts during each of the five fiscal years
ended september 30



                                             2001           2000           1999          1998           1997
                                                                                        
                                                                                         
 costreimbursable                            81             77            73           81             82
 fixedprice                                  16              18             22            18              16
 guaranteed maximum price                      3               5              5             1               2


     in accordance with industry practice most of the companys contracts are
subject to termination at the discretion of the client contracts typically
provide for reimbursement of costs incurred and payment of fees earned through
the date of such termination

                                    page 11

     when we are directly responsible for engineering design procurement and
construction of a project or the maintenance of a process plant we reflect the
costs of materials equipment and subcontracts in both revenues and costs on
other projects where the client elects to pay for such items directly these
amounts are not reflected in either revenues or costs the following table
presents the approximate amount of such passthrough costs included in revenues
for each of the five fiscal years ended september 30 in millions



                       2001              2000            1999             1998            1997
                                       
                                                                       
                   12729          14421        11670         10664          9196


     costreimbursable contracts
     

     costreimbursable contracts provide for reimbursement of costs incurred by
the company plus a predetermined fee or a fee based on a percentage of the
costs incurred the company prefers this type of contract since it believes that
the primary basis for its selection should be its technical expertise and
professional qualifications rather than price considerations

     fixedprice contracts
     

     fixedprice contracts include both negotiated fixedprice contracts and
lump sum bid contracts under a negotiated fixedprice contract the company
is first selected as the contractor and then the contract price is negotiated
negotiated fixedprice contracts frequently exist in singleresponsibility
arrangements where the company has the opportunity to perform engineering and
design work before negotiating the total price of the project under lump sum
bid contracts the company must bid against other contractors based upon
specifications furnished by the client this type of pricing presents certain
inherent risks including the possibility of ambiguities in the specifications
problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur
over the contract period that are reduced by the negotiation process thus
although both types of contracts involve a firm price for the client the lump
sum bid contract provides the greater degree of risk to the company however
because of economies that may be realized during the contract term both
negotiated fixedprice and lump sum bid contracts may offer greater profit
potential than the other types of contracts over the past five years most of
the companys fixed price work has been either negotiated fixedprice contracts
or lumpsum bid contracts for services rather than turnkey construction

     guaranteed maximum price contracts
     

     guaranteed maximum price contracts are performed in the same manner as
costreimbursable contracts however the total actual cost plus the fee cannot
exceed the guaranteed price negotiated with the client if the total actual cost
of the contract exceeds the guaranteed maximum price then the company will bear
all or a portion of the excess in those cases where the total actual cost and
fee are less than the guaranteed price the company will often share the savings
on a predetermined basis with the client

contractual guarantees and litigation generally such guarantees relate to
project schedules and plant performance most of the litigation involves the
company as a defendant in workers compensation personal injury and other
similar lawsuits in addition as a contractor for many agencies of the united

     for the purposes of complying with the amendments to the rules governing

undersigned registrant hereby undertakes as follows which undertaking shall be
incorporated by reference into the registrants registration statements on form

     insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act
of 1933 may be permitted to directors officers and controlling persons of the
registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise the registrant
has been advised that in the opinion of the securities and exchange commission
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the securities act
of 1933 and is therefore unenforceable in the event that a claim for
indemnification against such liabilities other than the payment by the
registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director officer or controlling
person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action suit or
proceeding is asserted by such director officer or controlling person in
connection with the securities being registered the registrant will unless in
the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the act and will
be governed by final adjudication of such issue
