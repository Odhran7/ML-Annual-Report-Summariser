we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that covid19 including the potential of new variants which may be more contagious or severe and may be less responsive to vaccines or treatments will have on our operations going forward due to uncertainties which will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will in turn depend on the currently unknowable duration and spread of the covid19 pandemic actions taken to limit the spread and the public’s willingness to comply with such actions the availability and efficacy of a vaccine and positive treatments for covid19 and the impact of governmental regulations that might be imposed in response to the pandemic numerous state local and foreign jurisdictions have imposed and others in the future may impose shelterinplace orders quarantines executive orders and similar government orders and restrictions for their residents to control the spread of covid19 such orders restrictions and changes in consumer behavior have negatively impacted our operations especially in our stores and supply chain in addition to these more nearterm impacts we are unable to accurately predict the full impact covid19 will have on our longerterm operations as well particularly with respect to our current mix of merchandise offerings eventbased categories and store traffic trends 

to the extent covid19 adversely affects our business operations financial condition and operating results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section such as those relating to our level of indebtedness our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness 

our net sales operating income cash and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis 

we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

seasonal fluctuations also affect our cash and inventory levels since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new trends are confirmed by customer purchases we must carry a significant amount of inventory especially before the holiday season selling period if we are not successful in selling inventory we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits from the separation which could harm our business 

on august 2 2021 we completed the separation of the bath  body works and victoria’s secret businesses we may incur significant additional expenses and challenges in connection with the separation of the victoria’s secret business which may include expenses and challenges related to our separation from the victorias secret information technology environment we are now a smaller and less diversified business than before the separation which could make us more vulnerable to changing market and economic conditions additionally a potential loss of synergies from the separation could negatively impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that are expected to result from the separation and the anticipated benefits of the separation are based on a number of assumptions some of which may prove incorrect if we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the separation or if such benefits are delayed our business could be harmed 

table of contents 

the separation could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders 

we received an opinion of counsel to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the spinoff and certain related transactions qualify for taxfree treatment under certain sections of the internal revenue code however the opinion relies on certain assumptions representations and undertakings including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business and the opinion would not be valid if such assumptions representations and undertakings were incorrect furthermore the opinion is not binding on the internal revenue service irs or the courts if notwithstanding receipt of the opinion the spinoff or certain related transactions are determined to be taxable we would be subject to a substantial tax liability in addition if the spinoff is taxable each holder of our common stock who received shares of victorias secret  co in connection with the spinoff would generally be treated as receiving a taxable dividend in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received 

even if the spinoff otherwise qualifies as a taxfree transaction the distribution would be taxable to us but not to our stockholders in certain circumstances if future significant acquisitions of our stock or the stock of victorias secret  co are determined to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the spinoff in this event the resulting tax liability could be substantial in connection with the spinoff we entered into a tax matters agreement with victorias secret  co pursuant to which victorias secret  co agreed to not enter into any transaction that could cause the spinoff or any related transactions to be taxable to us without our consent and to indemnify us for any tax liability resulting from any such transaction in addition these potential tax liabilities may discourage delay or prevent a change of control of us 

victoria’s secret  co continues to provide information technology services to us on a transitional basis and we may incur significant costs to perform these services ourselves following the transition period any inadequacy interruption integration failure or security failure of this technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 

our ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems we rely heavily on applications related to pointofsale ecommerce merchandising planning sourcing logistics inventory management data security and support systems including human resources and finance currently supplied to us by victoria’s secret  co pursuant to the tsa that we entered into in connection with the separation victoria’s secret  co is not in the business of providing information technology outsourcing services and does not have experience providing such services for thirdparties victorias secret  co may not successfully execute all of these services during the transition period or we may have to expend significant efforts andor costs materially in excess of those estimated by us to transition such services to our information technology systems and we may experience delays in such transition period any interruption in or deficiency of these services could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

turnover in company leadership or other key positions may have an adverse impact on company performance 

we may experience changes in key leadership or key positions in the future the departure of key leadership personnel can result in the loss of significant knowledge and experience this loss of knowledge and experience can be mitigated through successful hiring and transition but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such efforts attracting and retaining qualified senior leadership may be more challenging under adverse business conditions failure to attract and retain the right talent or to smoothly manage the transition of responsibilities resulting from such turnover could affect our ability to meet our challenges and may cause us to miss performance objectives or financial targets or disrupt our relationships with our customers or other thirdparties 

on february 22 2022 our board appointed then board chair sarah e nash as executive chair effective may 12 2022 ms nash will be appointed interim ceo and andrew m meslow will step down as ceo and as a member of the board due to health reasons our board is in the process of retaining a national search firm to assist in identifying a permanent ceo such leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage and an inadequate transition may cause disruption to our business including to our relationships with our associates and other thirdparties 

we may be impacted by our ability to attract develop and retain qualified associates and manage laborrelated costs 

we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer which requires us to have highly trained and engaged associates our success depends in part upon our ability to attract develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified associates including store personnel and talented merchants the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas competition for such qualified individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand delayed store openings significant increases in associate turnover rates or significant increases in laborrelated costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents 

an increase in the costs of associate wages benefits and insurance including workers’ compensation general liability property and health could adversely affect our operating results in particular labor shortages and the current competitive labor market have increased competition for qualified associates which has compelled and may continue to compel us to pay higher wages to attract or retain qualified associates such increases in costs may result from general economic or competitive conditions or from government imposition of higher minimum wages at the federal state or local level including in connection with the increases in state minimum wages that have recently been enacted by various states moreover there may be a longterm trend toward higher wages in developing markets any increase in such operating expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space 

most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers sales at these stores are derived in part from the volume of traffic in those retail areas our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area including “destination” retail stores to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by factors that we cannot control such as economic downturns or changes in consumer demographics in a particular area consumer trends away from brickandmortar retail toward online shopping competition from internet and other retailers and other retail areas where we do not have stores significant health hazards or pandemics the closing of other stores or the decline in popularity or safety in the shopping areas where our stores are located and the deterioration in the financial condition of the operators or developers of the shopping areas in which our stores are located 

part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs additionally we are dependent upon the suitability of the lease spaces that we currently use the leases that we enter into are generally noncancelable leases with initial terms of 10 years if we determine that it is no longer economical to operate a store and decide to close it we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our continued growth and success depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions 

our continued growth and success depends in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new stores into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our international operations and our plans for international expansion include risks that could impact our results and reputation 

we intend to continue to operate internationally and further expand into international markets through partner arrangements the risks associated with international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brand our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market any of these difficulties may lead to disruption in the overall timing of our international expansion efforts or increased costs further entry into other markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence other risks include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets volatility in the geopolitical landscape restrictions on the repatriation of funds held internationally disruptions or delays in shipments occurrence of significant health hazards or pandemics changes in diplomatic and trade relationships political instability and foreign governmental regulation such expansions will also have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance   

further our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates see “fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations” below 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents 

our licensees franchisees and wholesalers could take actions that could harm our business or brand images 

we have global representation through independently owned stores operated by our partners although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective partners the level of control we can exercise over our partners is limited and the quality and success of their operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control for example our partners may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel further we have no control as to whether our partners comply with federal and local law our brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our partners do not operate successfully these risks could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our direct channel business includes risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results 

our direct channel also referred to as digital or ecommerce is subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results risks include but are not limited to the difficulty in recreating the instore experience through our direct channels domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it outside our control our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in technology and logistics in order to appeal to existing and potential customers who increasingly rely on multiple channels to meet their shopping needs and the failure of and risks related to the systems that operate our web infrastructure websites and the related support systems including computer viruses theft of customer information privacy concerns telecommunication failures and electronic breakins and similar disruptions 

our failure to maintain efficient and uninterrupted ordertaking and fulfillment operations could also have a material adverse effect on our results we utilize thirdparty service providers for order management and fulfillment services if these thirdparty service providers do not maintain efficient and uninterrupted service we may experience merchandise delivery delays loss of sales cancellation charges or excessive promotional activity to clear inventory further we may have difficulty replacing these thirdparty service providers and there can be no assurance we can do so in a timely manner or on terms favorable to us the satisfaction of our online customers depends on their timely receipt of merchandise if we encounter difficulties with the distribution facilities or if the facilities were to shut down for any reason including as a result of fire natural disaster or work stoppage we could face shortages of inventory incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers and cause customer dissatisfaction 

any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to protect our reputation could have a material effect on our brand image 

our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand image our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity any negative publicity including information publicized through traditional or social media platforms and similar venues such as blogs websites and other forums may affect our reputation and brand and consequently reduce demand for our merchandise even if such publicity is unverified or inaccurate 

failure to comply with or the perception that the company has failed to comply with ethical social product labor privacy and environmental standards or related political considerations could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions including boycotts failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls to maintain the security of customer associate thirdparty and company information or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

our ability or perceived inability to complete environmental social and governance initiatives may have a material effect on our reputation 

there has been an increased focus including from investors the general public and us and foreign governmental and nongovernmental organizations on environmental social and governance esg initiatives including with respect to climate change greenhouse gases packaging and waste human rights sustainable supply chain practices animal health and welfare deforestation and land energy and water use as part of our ongoing efforts we established an esg function to provide direction and help coordinate esg work throughout the company there may be increased public pressure to expand our disclosures in these areas make commitments set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them which could expose us to market operational and execution costs or risks the metrics we disclose whether they are based on the standards we set for ourselves or those set by others may influence our reputation and the value of our brand our failure to achieve progress on our metrics on a timely basis or at all could adversely affect our business financial performance and growth by electing to set and share publicly these metrics and expand upon our disclosures our business may also face increased scrutiny related to esg activities as a result we could damage our reputation and the value of our brand if we fail to act responsibly in the areas in which we report any harm to our reputation resulting from setting these metrics expanding our 

table of contents 

disclosure or our failure or perceived failure to meet such metrics or disclosures could adversely affect our business financial performance and growth 

we could also be affected by the physical effects of climate change and other environmental issues to the extent such issues adversely affect the general economy adversely impact our supply chain or our stores or increase the costs of our products and other supplies needed for our operations in addition future us and international legislative and regulatory efforts to combat climate change or other environmental considerations could result in increased regulation and additional taxes and other expenses in a manner that adversely affects our business 

if our marketing advertising and promotional programs are unsuccessful or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are our results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected 

customer traffic and demand for our merchandise are influenced by our advertising marketing and promotional activities the name recognition and reputation of our brand and the location of and service offered in our stores and through our direct business although we use marketing advertising and promotional programs to attract customers through various media including social media websites mobile applications email and print some of our competitors may expend more for their programs than we do or use different approaches than we do which may provide them with a competitive advantage our programs may not be effective or could require increased expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to adequately maintain enforce and protect our trade names trademarks and patents could have an impact on our brand images and ability to penetrate new markets 

we believe that our trade names trademarks and patents are important assets and an essential element of our strategy we have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names trademarks and patents and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries there can be no assurance that we will obtain such applied for registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement or other violation of our intellectual property rights by others in particular the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if any thirdparty copies our products or our stores in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation it could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

third parties may assert rights in or ownership of our trademarks and other intellectual property rights or trademarks that are similar to our trademarks or claim that we are infringing misappropriating or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights we may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction and may be required to enter into costly license agreements be required to pay significant royalties settlements costs or damages be required to rebrand our products andor be prevented from selling some of our products 

our ability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segments of the retail industry could impact our results 

the retail industry is highly competitive we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers including individual and chain specialty stores department stores and discount retailers in addition to the traditional storebased retailers we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through online channels brand image marketing design price service assortment quality image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the storebased and online channels 

some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing and other resources available and trends across our product categories may favor our competitors we rely to a greater degree than some of our competitors on physical locations in retail centers therefore declines in traffic to such locations may affect us more significantly than our competitors some of our competitors sell their products in stores that are located in the same retail centers as our stores in addition to competing for sales we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in retail centers 

increased competition combined with declines in store andor online website traffic could result in price reductions increased marketing expenditures and loss of pricing power and market share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to manage the life cycle of our brand and to remain current with trends and launch new product lines successfully could impact the image and relevance of our brand 

our success depends in part on management’s ability to effectively manage the life cycle of our brand and to anticipate and respond to changing preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate salable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer we are dependent on certain product categories and a decline in consumer demand in these product categories could negatively effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows customer demands and trends change rapidly if we are unable to successfully anticipate identify or react to changing 

table of contents 

preferences or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines our sales will be lower potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold inventory in response we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by our ability to adequately source distribute and sell merchandise and other materials on a global basis 

we source merchandise and other materials directly in domestic and international markets we distribute merchandise and other materials globally to our partners in international locations and to our stores many of our imports and exports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements including existing or potential duties tariffs or safeguard quotas we compete with other companies for production facilities 

we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business on a global basis for example 

• political instability environmental hazards or natural disasters which could negatively affect international economies financial markets and business activity 

• significant health hazards or pandemics which could result in closed factories andor stores reduced workforces scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas 

• imposition of new or retaliatory trade duties sanctions or taxes and other charges on imports or exports 

• evolving new or complex legal and regulatory matters 

• volatility in currency exchange rates 

• local business practice and political issues including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards which may result in adverse publicity or threatened or actual adverse consumer actions including boycotts 

• delays or disruptions in shipping and transportation and related pricing impacts 

• disruption due to labor disputes and 

• changing expectations regarding product safety due to new legislation or other factors 

we also rely upon thirdparty transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments including shipments to and from our distribution centers to our stores and to our customers our utilization of these delivery services for shipments is subject to risks including increases in labor costs and fuel prices which would increase our shipping costs and associate strikes and inclement weather which may impact our transportation providers’ ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs further the rapid increase in demand for online shopping has led to increased pressure on the capacity of our fulfillment network 

the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains and created significant volatility of financial markets the covid19 pandemic continues to impact our supply chain partners including thirdparty manufacturers logistics providers and other vendors current vessel container and other transportation shortages labor shortages and port congestion globally have delayed and may continue to delay inventory orders and in turn deliveries to our customers and availability in our stores and ecommerce sites disruptions or delays in shipments may have negative impacts to pricing of certain components of our products the pandemic continues to have the potential to significantly impact our supply chain if the factories that manufacture our products the distribution centers where we manage our inventory or the operations of our logistics and other service providers are disrupted are temporarily closed or experience worker shortages in addition the impact of covid19 on macroeconomic conditions may impact the proper functioning of financial and capital markets foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates even after the covid19 global pandemic has subsided we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession that has occurred or may occur in the future 

we rely on a number of vendor and distribution facilities located in the same vicinity making our business susceptible to local and regional disruptions or adverse conditions 

to achieve the necessary speed and agility in producing our home fragrance body care products and soaps and sanitizer products we rely heavily on vendor and distribution facilities in close proximity to our headquarters in central ohio as a result of geographic concentration of the vendor and distribution facilities that we rely upon our operations are susceptible to local and regional factors such as accidents system failures economic and weather conditions natural disasters demographic and population changes and other unforeseen events and circumstances any significant interruption in the operations of these facilities could lead to inventory issues or increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents 

a change in the relationship with our key vendors could have a material effect on our business 

we rely on a limited number of vendors to support our inventory purchasing needs in fiscal year 2021 our largest vendor supplied approximately 12 of our total merchandise purchases and our largest five vendors supplied approximately 35 of our total merchandise purchases on a combined basis our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and on our vendors’ ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms for example financial or operational difficulties that our vendors may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source products from them 

we may be impacted by our vendors’ ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner meet quality standards and comply with applicable laws and regulations 

we purchase products from thirdparty vendors factors outside our control such as production shipping delays quality problems or natural disasters could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales cancellation charges or excessive markdowns 

in addition quality problems could result in product liability judgments or widespread product recalls that may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability competition reaction and consumer attitudes even if product liability claims are unsuccessful or are not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertions could adversely impact our reputation with existing and potential customers and our brand image 

our business could also suffer if our thirdparty vendors fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations while our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our associates and thirdparty compliance auditors visit and monitor the operations of our thirdparty vendors we do not control these vendors or their practices the violation of labor environmental or other laws by thirdparty vendors used by us or the divergence of a thirdparty vendor’s or partner’s labor or environmental practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales profits assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition our royalty arrangements are calculated based on sales in local currency and as such we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations although we may use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency risks these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the shortterm negative impacts of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations financial condition and cash flows hedging would generally not be effective in offsetting the longterm impact of sustained shifts in foreign exchange rates on our business results as a result the fluctuation in the value of the us dollar against other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results may be affected by fluctuations in product input costs 

product input costs including freight labor and raw materials fluctuate subject to price volatility caused by any fluctuation in aggregate supply and demand or other external conditions such as weather and climate conditions energy costs or natural events or disasters taxes and tariffs including as a result of trade disputes industry demand inflationary conditions labor shortages transportation issues fuel costs product recalls governmental regulation and other factors all of which are beyond our control and in many instances are unpredictable these factors may result in an increase in our production costs we may not be able to or may elect not to pass these increases on to our customers which may adversely impact our profit margins these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results may be affected by fluctuations in energy costs 

energy costs have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future due to changes in factors beyond our control such as weather and climate conditions or natural events or disasters taxes and tariffs including as a result of trade disputes industry demand inflationary conditions labor shortages transportation issues fuel costs political conflicts and wars governmental regulation and other factors these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase products from our manufacturers a continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents 

our results may be impacted by our ability to adequately protect our assets from loss and theft 

our assets are subject to loss including those caused by illegal or unethical conduct by associates customers vendors or unaffiliated third parties we have experienced events such as inventory shrinkage in the past and we cannot assure that incidences of loss and theft will decrease in the future or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce these losses higher rates of loss or increased security costs to combat theft could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by increases in the cost of mailing paper printing or other order fulfillment logistics 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and promotional mailings we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to recover these costs or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing mailing delivery and order fulfillment systems we may face unexpected costs in transportation warehousing or other logisticsrelated services these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we selfinsure certain risks and may be impacted by unfavorable claims experience 

we are selfinsured for various types of insurable risks including associate medical benefits workers’ compensation property general liability and automobile up to certain stoploss limits claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile any adverse claims experience could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we significantly rely on our and our thirdparty service providers including victorias secret  co ability to implement and sustain information technology systems and to protect associated data and system availability 

our success depends in part on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our and our thirdparty services providers and vendors information technology systems our information technology systems as well as those of our service providers and vendors are vulnerable to damage interruption or breach from a variety of sources including cyberattacks ransomware attacks telecommunication failures malicious human acts and natural disasters moreover despite maintaining comprehensive measures some of our systems ecommerce environments servers and those of our service providers and vendors are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses and similar disruptive problems such incidents could disrupt our operations including our ability to timely ship and track product orders and project inventory requirements and lead to interruptions or delays in our supply chain additionally these types of problems could result in an actual or perceived breach of confidential customer merchandise financial associate or other important information including personal information which could result in damage to our reputation costly litigation customer complaints negative publicity breach notification obligations regulatory or administrative sanctions inquiries orders or investigations indemnity obligations damages for contract breach or penalties for violations of applicable laws or regulations the increased use of smartphones tablets and other mobile devices may also heighten these and other operational risks despite the precautions we have taken unanticipated problems or events may nevertheless cause failures in or unauthorized access to our and our thirdparty services providers’ and vendors information technology systems sustained or repeated system disruptions that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores impact our customers’ ability to access our websites and mobile applications in a timely manner or expose confidential customer information merchandise financial or other important information including personal information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

as a result of the separation we have entered into a multiyear tsa with victorias secret  co for information technology services and systems to support the daytoday needs for most areas of technology over time we will transition the information technology capabilities from victorias secret  co to implement pointofsale mobile applications merchandising planning sourcing logistics inventory management human resources and financial systems on to our own platforms some of which are yet to be established 

as systems are provided supported and managed by victorias secret  co and eventually transitioned to us we will be required to establish a number of new information technology systems as well as make hardware software and code modifications and upgrades to certain existing information technology systems for pointofsale ecommerce mobile apps merchandising planning sourcing logistics inventory management data security and support systems including human resources and finance modifications involve replacing existing systems with successor systems making changes to existing systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing and modifying our information technology systems including risks relative to data integrity and system disruptions information technology system disruptions or data corruption if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition to our own systems networks and databases we use thirdparty service providers to store transmit and otherwise process certain of this information on our behalf and our thirdparty service providers are subject to similar cybersecurity risks

due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations we may be held responsible for any cybersecurity incidents attributed to our service providers as they relate to the information we share with them or to which they are granted access although we contractually require these service providers to implement and maintain a standard of security such as implementing reasonable measures we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in their systems 

any significant compromise or breach of our data security including the security of customer associate thirdparty or company information could have a material adverse effect on our reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in the operation of our business we collect use transmit and otherwise process a large volume of personal and other confidential proprietary and sensitive information information systems are susceptible to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks breaches or failures of security involving our information systems including those provided managed and supported by victorias secret  co or those of any of our external service providers have occurred and in the future may occur any significant compromise or breach of our data security media reports about such an incident whether accurate or not or our failure to make adequate or timely disclosures to the public or law enforcement agencies following any such event whether due to delayed discovery or a failure to follow existing protocols could significantly damage our reputation with our customers associates investors and other third parties cause the disclosure of personal confidential proprietary or sensitive customer associate thirdparty or company information cause interruptions to our operations and distraction to our management cause our customers to stop shopping with us and result in significant legal regulatory and financial liabilities and lost revenues compounding these risks is the complexity of our information systems which are a collection of our and our thirdparty service providers’ systems 

while we train our associates and have implemented systems processes and security measures to protect our physical facilities and information technology systems against unauthorized access and prevent data loss there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security threats despite these measures we have been and may in the future be vulnerable to targeted or random attacks on our systems that could lead to security breaches phishing attacks denial of service attacks acts of vandalism computer viruses malware ransomware misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or similar events our systems and facilities are also subject to compromise from internal threats such as theft misuse unauthorized access or other improper actions by associates thirdparty service providers and other third parties with otherwise legitimate access to our systems websites mobile applications or facilities which risks may be heightened as a result of workfromhome policies and technologies implemented in the wake of the covid19 pandemic furthermore because the methods of cyberattack and deception change frequently are increasingly complex and sophisticated and can originate from a wide variety of sources including nationstate actors despite our reasonable efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems websites and mobile applications it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate detect appropriately react and respond to or implement effective preventative measures against all cybersecurity incidents 

we have and may in the future be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against respond to and recover from any potential attempted or existing cybersecurity incidents as cybersecurity incidents continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities in addition our remediation efforts may not be successful or may not be completed in a timely manner the inability to implement maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows moreover there could be public announcements regarding any cybersecurity incidents and any steps we take to respond to or remediate such incidents and if securities analysts or investors perceive these announcements to be negative it could among other things have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock 

while we currently maintain cybersecurity insurance such insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to breaches failures or other data securityrelated incidents and we cannot be certain that cyber insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

risks related to our common stock 

our stock price may be volatile 

our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry any guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe are reasonably attainable at the time guidance is given if or when we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us outside investment analysts or others our stock price could be adversely affected investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk 

table of contents 

the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of listed companies in particular our common stock may in the future be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock further influencing volatility in its market price public perception and other factors outside of our control may additionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention regardless of actual operating performance 

if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends or repurchase our shares at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be impacted 

our quarterly cash dividends and share repurchase programs have historically been part of our capital allocation strategy although our board increased the annual dividend to 080 per share beginning with the quarterly dividend paid in march 2022 and authorized a new 15 billion share repurchase program in february 2022 we are not required to declare dividends or make any share repurchases under our share repurchase programs in the future in 2020 we didnt repurchase any of our shares and we suspended our quarterly cash dividends due to the effects of the covid19 pandemic our board will determine our future levels of dividend payments and share repurchase authorizations if any giving consideration to our levels of profit and cash flow capital requirements current and forecasted liquidity the restrictions placed upon us by our borrowing arrangements as well as financial and other conditions which may be beyond our control any reduction or failure to pay dividends or repurchase our shares after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation investor confidence in us and our stock price 

shareholder activism could cause us to incur significant expense hinder execution of our business strategy and impact our stock price 

shareholder activism which can take many forms and arise in a variety of situations could result in substantial costs and divert management’s and our board’s attention and resources from our business additionally such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future adversely affect our relationships with our associates customers or service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel also we may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters including for thirdparty advisors our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events risks and uncertainties of any shareholder activism 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our ability to maintain our credit ratings could affect our ability to access capital and could increase our interest expense 

the credit rating agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings a deterioration in our capital structure or the quality and stability of our earnings could result in a downgrade of our credit ratings any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive if our ability to access capital becomes constrained our interest costs will likely increase which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows additionally changes to our credit ratings could affect our future interest costs 

we may be unable to service or refinance our debt or maintain compliance with restrictive covenants in our debt instruments including our assetbacked revolving credit facility 

we currently have substantial indebtedness our assetbacked revolving credit facility contains a covenant and negative covenants that under certain circumstances require maintenance of a certain financial ratio and also under certain conditions restrict our ability to pay dividends repurchase common shares and make other restricted payments as defined in the agreement our cash flow from operations provides the primary source of funds for our debt service payments if our cash flow from operations declines we may be unable to service or refinance our current debt if we fail to comply with any covenant including our financial covenant it could result in an event of default and our lenders could terminate the commitments under our assetbacked revolving credit facility and make the entire debt incurred thereunder immediately due and payable or we may be forced to sell assets restructure our indebtedness or seek additional equity capital which would dilute our stockholders’ interests 

table of contents 

the interest rates on our credit facilities may be impacted by the phaseout of libor and the transition to the secured overnight financing rate “sofr” 

interest rates on us borrowings under our assetbacked revolving credit facility abl facility are based on libor on july 27 2017 the uk’s financial conduct authority the authority that administers libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2023 it remains unclear what rate or rates may develop as accepted alternatives to libor or what the effect of such changes will be on the markets for liborbased financial instruments as of the date hereof the current recommended replacement for usdlibor is sofr while we currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under our abl facility any transition away from libor as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate is complex and will affect the cost of servicing any future debt under our abl facility although the abl facility provides for alternative base rates the composition and characteristics of such alternative base rates are not the same as those of libor and the consequences of the phaseout of libor cannot be entirely predicted at this time 

risks related to law and regulation 

changes in laws regulations or technology platform rules relating to data privacy and security or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or contractual or other obligations relating to data privacy and security could have a material adverse effect on our reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we are and may increasingly become subject to various laws directives industry standards and regulations as well as contractual obligations relating to data privacy and security in the jurisdictions in which we operate the legal and regulatory environment related to data privacy and security is increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future these laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and it is possible that they will be interpreted and applied in ways that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in the us privacy and data protection are regulated at federal state and local levels various federal and state regulators including governmental agencies like the consumer financial protection bureau and the federal trade commission have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations concerning personal information and data security and have prioritized privacy and information security violations for enforcement actions certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope or offer greater individual rights with respect to personal information than federal international or other state laws and such laws may differ from each other all of which may complicate compliance efforts 

laws range from the “sectoral” variety ie laws that govern specific practices services or technologies to omnibus laws ie laws that comprehensively seek to govern all aspects of data processing practices as an online and brickandmortar retailer we are subject to both 

in north america we are subject to sectoral laws that impose different enforcement regimes whether via government agencies or classaction litigants with fines and statutory damages that can result in significant exposure when applied to large customer segments illustrative of the sectoral variety are laws that govern telephonic communications eg the federal telephone consumer protection act email communications eg the federal controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing act and canada’s antispam legislation the use of biometric technology eg the illinois biometric information privacy act the printing of payment card digits on a store receipt eg the federal fair and accurate credit transactions act the use of call recordings eg federal and state laws governing consent for recordings the collection of consumer information at retail point of sale eg the california songbeverly act and the collection of driver’s license information eg state laws governing the scanning of government id’s 

we are further subject to omnibus privacy and data protection laws for example the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which broadly governs data privacy practices increases privacy rights for california residents and imposes obligations on companies that process their personal information went into effect on january 1 2020 among other things the ccpa requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to california consumers and provide such consumers new data protection and privacy rights including the ability to optout of certain data sharing arrangements of personal information and the ability to access and delete personal information the ccpa provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of certain classifications of personal information this private right of action may increase the likelihood of and risks associated with data breach litigation furthermore in november 2020 california voters passed the california privacy rights act of 2020 “cpra” effective beginning january 1 2023 the cpra imposes additional obligations on companies covered by the legislation and will significantly modify the ccpa including by expanding california residents’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information the cpra also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the ccpa and cpra other states and countries have passed comprehensive data privacy laws that are similar to the ccpa and cpra further complicating the legal landscape and similar legislation is pending in more states in addition laws in all 50 us states require businesses to provide notice to 

table of contents 

consumers and in some cases to regulators when certain classifications of personal information have been accessed or acquired as a result of a data breach state laws are changing rapidly and there is discussion in congress of a new comprehensive federal data privacy law to which we would become subject if it is enacted which may add additional complexity variation in requirements restrictions and potential legal risk require additional investment of resources in compliance programs impact strategies and the availability of previously useful data and could result in increased compliance costs or changes in business practices and policies 

while most of our international operations are conducted through franchise license and wholesale arrangements we are also subject to certain international laws regulations and standards in certain international jurisdictions and may be subject to additional international laws regulations and standards whether existing or enacted in the future that apply broadly to the collection use retention security disclosure transfer and other processing of personal information one set of laws applicable to us is canada’s personal information protection and electronic documents act “pipeda” which became effective on january 1 2001 as well as substantially similar provincial privacy laws these privacy statutes broadly govern the entire lifecycle of personal information enumerating principles that govern accountability purpose consent limitations on collection use disclosure and retention accuracy safeguards transparency right to access and complainthandling certain of the statutes also contain a mandatory breach notification regime federal and provincial authorities enforce these laws privacy regulators have an express obligation to investigate complaints and have the authority to initiate investigations under pipeda the office of the privacy commissioner of canada has the power to require an organization to enter into a compliance agreement and failure to comply may result in a court order or court proceedings a complainant may also appeal to federal court and the court has broad authority including awarding damages similarly the eu general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 greatly increased the european commission’s jurisdictional reach of its laws and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data and the gdpr serves and has served as a model for other jurisdictions’ data protection laws eu member states are tasked under the gdpr to enact and have enacted certain implementing legislation that adds to andor further interprets the gdpr requirements and depending on the extent and degree to which we conduct business in the european economic area “eea” and united kingdom potentially extends our obligations and potential liability for failing to meet such obligations the gdpr together with national legislation regulations and guidelines of the eu member states and the united kingdom governing the processing of personal data impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect use retain protect disclose transfer and otherwise process personal data and other international jurisdictions are expected to pass similar laws that may include even more stringent requirements changes in such international laws or changes in our business strategy such as direct expansions into additional jurisdictions may cause us to incur additional compliance costs increase our risks of being subject to lawsuits complaints andor regulatory investigations or fines or restrict our ability to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate or may in the future operate such international laws and our compliance with such laws could impact the manner in which we do business and the geographical location or segregation of our relevant operations and could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs such as costs related to organizational changes implementing additional protection technologies and training associates and engaging consultants which are likely to increase over time in addition such requirements may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies distract management or divert resources from other initiatives and projects all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any applicable federal state or similar foreign laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security could result in damage to our reputation and our relationship with our customers as well as proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies or customers including classaction privacy and dataprotection litigation in certain jurisdictions which could subject us to significant fines sanctions awards penalties or judgments any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by our ability to comply with regulatory requirements 

we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements our policies procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable foreign and domestic laws and regulations including those required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act the sec and the new york stock exchange nyse among others although we have put in place policies and procedures aimed at ensuring legal and regulatory compliance our associates subcontractors vendors licensees franchisees and other third parties could take actions that violate these laws and regulations any violations of such laws or regulations could have an adverse effect on our reputation market price of our common stock results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

it can be difficult to comply with sometimes conflicting regulations in local national or foreign jurisdictions as well as new or changing regulations also changes in such laws could make operating our business more expensive or require us to change the way we do business for example changes in product safety or other consumer protection laws could lead to increased costs for certain merchandise or additional labor costs associated with readying merchandise for sale it may be difficult for us to 

table of contents 

oversee regulatory changes impacting our business and our responses to changes in the law could be costly and may negatively impact our operations 

we may be adversely impacted by certain compliance or legal matters 

we along with third parties we do business with are subject to complex compliance and litigation risks actions filed against us from time to time include commercial tort intellectual property customer employment wage and hour data privacy securities anticorruption and other claims including purported class action lawsuits in addition notwithstanding our adoption of cdcrecommended guidelines and preventative efforts to ensure the health and safety of our customers and associates it is possible that our customers and associates may contract covid19 while at our stores or facilities which could subject us to litigation the cost of defending against these types of claims against us or the ultimate resolution of such claims whether by settlement or adverse court decision may harm our business further potential claimants may be encouraged to bring suits based on a settlement from us or adverse court decisions against us we cannot currently assess the likely outcome of such suits but if the outcome were negative it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition we may be impacted by litigation trends including class action lawsuits involving consumers and stockholders that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation the market price of our common stock results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by changes in taxation trade and other regulatory requirements 

we are subject to income tax in local national and international jurisdictions in addition our products are subject to import and excise duties andor sales or valueadded taxes in many jurisdictions we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the irs and other tax authorities and governmental bodies we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations fluctuations in tax rates and duties changes in tax legislation or regulation or adverse outcomes of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

there is increased uncertainty with respect to tax policy and trade relations between the us and other countries including as a result of any executive action taken or legislative priorities set by the current us presidential administration major developments in tax policy or trade relations such as the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

executive and 2021 overview 

the transformation of our business that started in 2020 continued into 2021 with the successful separation of l brands inc into bath  body works inc and victoria’s secret  co as separate standalone companies in august 2021 the separation enables us to pursue growth strategies best suited to our customer base and strategic objectives with a goal to return the highest value to our stockholders we have a demonstrated record of consistent sales and operating income growth as well as a proven ability to respond quickly to evolving customer tastes with a highspeed sourcing and logistics model with high brand awareness and an increasingly loyal and growing customer base we believe we are well positioned for continued growth in north america as well as globally

2022 outlook 

we believe that the bath  body works brand is strong with continued opportunities for growth in 2022 we are investing in the business to support longterm growth and there are macroeconomic factors such as inflation that will impact our results the following macroeconomic pressures and investments could impact our results of operations and cash flows in 2022 

• we are lapping two years of extraordinary growth in the business since 2019 sales have increased by 46 and operating income has increased by 93 the first quarter of 2021 benefited from customers receiving government stimulus payments 

• we are experiencing increased inflationary pressures in raw materials energy and fuel costs as well as transportation and wage rates we estimate that these increased and incremental costs could range between 150 million and 175 million throughout 2022 while we have strategically raised prices and are carefully managing promotional activity to partially offset these costs we plan to be thoughtful about customer response to additional price increases 

• we continue to invest in the customer experience and plan to introduce our loyalty program to the balance of our us chain starting in summer 2022 we expect that the loyalty program will drive sales and customer retention deepening our relationships with customers over the longterm the introduction of the program will result in an initial revenue deferral for our customers’ accumulated points until they are used and 

• we are experiencing some deleverage and incremental project costs as we build and separate our own technology function to support our standalone business we are also investing in a new companyoperated fulfillment center to complement our existing thirdparty network

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

we did not adopt any new accounting standards during 2021 that had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows in addition as of march 18 2022 there are no new accounting standards not yet adopted that are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements on an ongoing basis management evaluates its accounting policies estimates and judgments including those related to inventories valuation of longlived store assets claims and contingencies income taxes and revenue recognition management bases our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may 

table of contents 

differ from these estimates management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position 

inventories 

inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value on an average cost basis 

we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of inventory on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

we also record inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory these estimates are based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends 

management believes that the assumptions used in these estimates are reasonable and appropriate a 10 increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net income from continuing operations by approximately 2 million for 2021 a 10 increase or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net income from continuing operations by approximately 1 million for 2021 

valuation of longlived store assets 

longlived store assets which include leasehold improvements store related assets and operating lease assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable store assets are grouped at the lowest level for which they are largely independent of other assets or asset groups if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset group are less than the carrying value we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset group for operating lease assets we determine the fair value of the assets by comparing the contractual rent payments to estimated market rental rates an individual asset within an asset group is not impaired below its estimated fair value the fair value of longlived store assets are determined using level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy 

when a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life 

claims and contingencies 

we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits taxes insurance regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business our determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the consolidated financial statements is based on management’s view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency we consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seek input from both internal and external experts with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business we accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible as opposed to probable or if an estimate is not reasonably determinable disclosure of a material claim or contingency is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our consolidated statements of income loss in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 

significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities in determining our provision for income taxes we consider permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates our effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings 

we follow the authoritative guidance included in asc 740 income taxes  which contains a twostep approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals 

table of contents 

or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and for which actual outcomes may differ from forecasted outcomes our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 

our income tax returns like those of most companies are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified we adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue based on the amount we expect to receive when control of the goods or services is transferred to our customer we recognize sales upon customer receipt of merchandise which for direct channel revenues reflect an estimate of shipments that have not yet been received by our customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times our shipping and handling revenues are included in net sales with the related costs included in costs of goods sold buying and occupancy in our consolidated statements of income loss we also provide a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience net sales exclude sales and other similar taxes collected from customers 

we offer a loyalty program that allows customers to earn points based on purchasing activity as customers accumulate points and reach point thresholds they can use the points to purchase merchandise in stores or online we allocate revenue to points earned on qualifying purchases and defer recognition until the points are redeemed the amount of revenue deferred is based on the relative standalone selling price method which includes an estimate for points not expected to be redeemed based on historical experience 

we sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers we do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards we recognize revenue from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer in addition we recognize revenue on unredeemed gift cards where the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions gift card breakage gift card breakage revenue is recognized in proportion and over the same period as actual gift card redemptions we determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns gift card breakage is included in net sales in our consolidated statements of income loss 

we also recognize revenues associated with franchise license wholesale and sourcing arrangements revenue recognized under franchise and license arrangements generally consists of royalties earned and recognized upon sale of merchandise by franchise and license partners to retail customers revenue is generally recognized under wholesale and sourcing arrangements at the time the title passes to the partner 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates we may use derivative financial instruments like foreign currency forward contracts crosscurrency swaps and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

foreign exchange rate risk 

our canadian dollar denominated earnings are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all our merchandise sold in canada is sourced through us dollar transactions although we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset risks associated with our operations in canada these measures may not succeed in offsetting all the shortterm impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally may not be effective in offsetting the longterm impact of sustained shifts in foreign currency rates 

further although our royalty arrangements with our international partners are denominated in us dollars the royalties we receive in us dollars are calculated based on sales in the local currency as a result our royalties in these arrangements are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations

all our longterm debt as of january 29 2022 has fixed interest rates we will from time to time adjust our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap arrangements our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows 

fair value of financial instruments 

as of january 29 2022 we believe that the carrying values of accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of their short maturity 

the following table provides a summary of the principal value and estimated fair value of outstanding publicly traded debt as of january 29 2022 and january 30 2021 

 

a the estimated fair value is based on reported transaction prices the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange

in addition to the other information set forth in this report the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results the risks described below are not our only risks additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business operating results andor financial condition in a material way 

risks related to our business 

our net sales profit results and cash flows are sensitive to and may be affected by general economic conditions consumer confidence spending patterns significant health hazards or pandemics weather or other market disruptions 

our net sales profit cash flows and future growth may be affected by negative local regional national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers’ ability or willingness to spend including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war terrorism or the threat thereof in addition market disruptions due to natural disasters significant health hazards or pandemics or other major events or the prospect of these events could also impact consumer spending and confidence levels extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located particularly in markets where we have multiple stores could adversely affect our business purchases of our products may decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak in such circumstances we may increase the number of promotional sales which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the decision by the uk to leave the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” has increased the uncertainty in the economic and political environment in europe on december 24 2020 the uk and eu reached a postbrexit trade and cooperation agreement that contains new rules governing the new relationship between the uk and the eu including with respect to trade travel and immigration among other things our business in the uk may be adversely impacted by ongoing uncertainty fluctuations in currency exchange rates changes in trade policies or changes in labor immigration tax data 

table of c ontents 

privacy or other laws any of these effects among others could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the novel coronavirus global pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

in march 2020 the coronavirus pandemic was declared a global pandemic by the world health organization this pandemic has negatively affected the us and global economies disrupted global supply chains and financial markets and led to significant travel and transportation restrictions including mandatory closures and orders to “shelterinplace” the actions that governments around the world have taken to contain the spread of covid19 have resulted in a period of disruption including closure of our stores limited store operating hours reduced customer traffic and consumer spending and delays in manufacturing and shipping of products and raw materials during this period we are focused on protecting the health and safety of our customers employees contractors suppliers and other business partners we are also working with our suppliers to minimize potential disruptions while managing our business in response to a changing dynamic our business operations and financial performance for 2020 have been materially impacted by the covid19 pandemic all of our stores in north america were closed on march 17 2020 and almost all remained closed as of the beginning of the second quarter we reopened our stores by the end of the second quarter 2020 in accordance with local restrictions and where we believed we could provide for the safety and wellbeing of our employees and customers due to the uncertainty of covid19 and the speed at which the pandemic continues to impact our markets we are continuing to assess the situation including governmentimposed restrictions market by market 

we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that covid19 will have on our operations going forward due to uncertainties which will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will in turn depend on the currently unknowable duration and spread of the covid19 pandemic actions taken to limit the spread and the public’s willingness to comply with such actions the availability and efficacy of a vaccine and positive treatments for covid19 and the impact of governmental regulations that might be imposed in response to the pandemic numerous state and local jurisdictions have imposed and others in the future may impose shelterinplace orders quarantines executive orders and similar government orders and restrictions for their residents to control the spread of covid19 such orders restrictions and changes in consumer behavior have negatively impacted our operations especially in our stores in addition to these more nearterm impacts we are unable to accurately predict the full impact covid19 will have on our longerterm operations as well particularly with respect to our current mix of merchandise offerings eventbased categories and store traffic trends 

to the extent covid19 adversely affects our business operations financial condition and operating results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “risk factors” section such as those relating to our high level of indebtedness our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness 

our net sales operating income cash and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis 

we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

seasonal fluctuations also affect our cash and inventory levels since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases we must carry a significant amount of inventory especially before the holiday season selling period if we are not successful in selling inventory we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the proposed separation of the victoria’s secret business and related operations could negatively impact our business and contingent liabilities from the divestiture of such business could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

on february 4 2021 we announced that we are currently targeting august 2021 to complete the separation of the victoria’s secret and bath  body works businesses we are considering all options including a spinoff of the victoria’s secret business into a public company or a private sale of the victoria’s secret business the separation poses risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business for example we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all and unanticipated developments could delay prevent or otherwise adversely affect any such separation including but not limited to market disruptions in general or financial market conditions or potential problems or delays in obtaining various regulatory and tax approvals or clearances in addition the separation may dilute our earnings per share have other adverse financial and accounting impacts and distract management in addition we may be required to indemnify buyers or any spunoff entity against known and unknown contingent liabilities in connection with the separation of the victoria’s 

table of c ontents 

secret business the resolution of these contingencies may have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations uncertainty about the effect of the separation of the victoria’s secret business on employees commercial partners and vendors may have an adverse effect on us these uncertainties may impair our ability to retain and motivate key personnel and could cause commercial partners vendors and others that deal with us to defer or decline entering into contracts with us or seek to change existing business relationships with us in addition if key employees depart because of uncertainty about their future roles and the potential complexities of any potential separation of victoria’s secret our business could be harmed if we are unable to separate the victoria’s secret business we will continue to be subject to the risks of operating such business we may incur significant expenses and challenges in connection with the separation of the victoria’s secret business which may include expenses and challenges related to the separation of victorias secret from our current information technology environment in addition we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that are expected to result from such separation and the anticipated benefits of such separation are based on a number of assumptions some of which may prove incorrect 

retained or contingent liabilities from businesses that we divest could adversely affect our financial results 

in the fourth quarter of 2018 we completed the sale of la senza to an affiliate of regent lp a global private equity firm as a result of the la senza divestiture we may incur unexpected contingent liabilities including with respect to leases assumed by the buyer our divestiture activities may also present financial and operational risks those risks may include difficulties separating personnel financial and other systems and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyer any of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

turnover in company leadership or other key positions may have an adverse impact on company performance 

we may experience further changes in key leadership or key positions in the future the departure of key leadership personnel can result in the loss of significant knowledge and experience this loss of knowledge and experience can be mitigated through successful hiring and transition but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such efforts attracting and retaining qualified senior leadership may be more challenging under adverse business conditions failure to attract and retain the right talent or to smoothly manage the transition of responsibilities resulting from such turnover could affect our ability to meet our challenges and may cause us to miss performance objectives or financial targets or disrupt our relationships with our customers 

we may be impacted by our ability to attract develop and retain qualified associates and manage laborrelated costs 

we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer which requires us to have highly trained and engaged associates our success depends in part upon our ability to attract develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified associates including store personnel and talented merchants the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas competition for such qualified individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand delayed store openings significant increases in associate turnover rates or significant increases in laborrelated costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space 

most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers sales at these stores are derived in part from the volume of traffic in those retail areas our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area including “destination” retail stores to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by factors that we cannot control such as economic downturns or changes in consumer demographics in a particular area consumer trends away from brickandmortar retail toward online shopping competition from internet and other retailers and other retail areas where we do not have stores significant health hazards or pandemics the closing of other stores or the decline in popularity or safety in the shopping areas where our stores are located and the deterioration in the financial condition of the operators or developers of the shopping areas in which our stores are located 

part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs some of our store locations require significant upfront capital investment and have material lease commitments additionally we are dependent upon the suitability of the lease spaces that we currently use the leases that we enter into are generally noncancelable leases with initial terms of 10 years if we determine that it is no longer economical to operate a store and decide to close it we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term 

table of c ontents 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new stores into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our international operations and our plans for international expansion include risks that could impact our results and reputation 

we intend to continue to operate internationally and further expand into international markets including mainland china through partner arrangements andor companyoperated stores the risks associated with international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market any of these difficulties may lead to disruption in the overall timing of our international expansion efforts or increased costs further entry into other markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence other risks include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets volatility in the geopolitical landscape restrictions on the repatriation of funds held internationally disruptions or delays in shipments occurrence of significant health hazards or pandemics changes in diplomatic and trade relationships political instability and foreign governmental regulation such expansions will also have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance 

  

further our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates see “fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations” below 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our licensees franchisees and wholesalers could take actions that could harm our business or brand images 

we have global representation through independently owned stores operated by our partners although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective partners the level of control we can exercise over our partners is limited and the quality and success of their operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control for example our partners may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel further we have no control as to whether our partners comply with federal and local law our brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our partners do not operate successfully these risks could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our direct channel businesses include risks that could have an effect on our results 

our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results risks include but are not limited to the difficulty in recreating the instore experience through our direct channels domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it outside our control our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in technology and logistics in order to appeal to existing and potential customers who increasingly rely on multiple channels to meet their shopping needs the failure of and risks related to the systems that operate our web infrastructure websites and the related support systems including computer viruses theft of customer information privacy concerns telecommunication failures and electronic breakins and similar disruptions 

our failure to maintain efficient and uninterrupted ordertaking and fulfillment operations could also have a material adverse effect on our results the satisfaction of our online customers depends on their timely receipt of merchandise if we encounter difficulties with the distribution facilities or if the facilities were to shut down for any reason including as a result of fire natural disaster or work stoppage we could face shortages of inventory incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers and cause customer dissatisfaction 

any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition and cash flows 

table of c ontents 

our ability to protect our reputation could have a material effect on our brand images 

our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity any negative publicity including information publicized through traditional or social media platforms and similar venues such as blogs websites and other forums may affect our reputation and brand and consequently reduce demand for our merchandise even if such publicity is unverified or inaccurate 

failure to comply with or the perception that the company has failed to comply with ethical social product labor privacy and environmental standards or related political considerations could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions including boycotts failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls to maintain the security of customer associate thirdparty and company information or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

if our marketing advertising and promotional programs are unsuccessful or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are our revenue or results of operations may be adversely affected 

customer traffic and demand for our merchandise are influenced by our advertising marketing and promotional activities the name recognition and reputation of our brands and the location of and service offered in our stores although we use marketing advertising and promotional programs to attract customers through various media including social media websites mobile applications email print and television some of our competitors may expend more for their programs than we do or use different approaches than we do which may provide them with a competitive advantage our programs may not be effective or could require increased expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations 

our ability to adequately maintain enforce and protect our trade names trademarks and patents could have an impact on our brand images and ability to penetrate new markets 

we believe that our trade names trademarks and patents are important assets and an essential element of our strategy we have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names trademarks and patents and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries there can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement or other violation of our intellectual property rights by others in particular the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if any thirdparty copies our products or our stores in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation it could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

third parties may assert rights in or ownership of our trademarks and other intellectual property rights or trademarks that are similar to our trademarks or claim that we are infringing misappropriating or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights we may be unable to successfully resolve these type of conflicts to our satisfaction and may be required to enter into costly license agreements be required to pay significant royalty settlements costs or damages required to rebrand our products andor be prevented from selling some of our products 

our ability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could impact our results 

the retail industry is highly competitive we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers including individual and chain specialty stores department stores and discount retailers in addition to the traditional storebased retailers we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through online channels brand image marketing design price service assortment quality image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the storebased and online channels 

some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing and other resources available and trends across our product categories may favor our competitors we rely to a greater degree than some of our competitors on physical locations in shopping malls and centers and so declines in traffic to such locations may affect us more significantly than our competitors some of our competitors sell their products in stores that are located in the same shopping malls and centers as our stores in addition to competing for sales we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls and centers 

increased competition combined with declines in mall andor online website traffic could result in price reductions increased marketing expenditures and loss of pricing power and market share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

our ability to manage the life cycle of our brands and to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could impact the image and relevance of our brands 

our success depends in part on management’s ability to effectively manage the life cycle of our brands and to anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate salable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer we are dependent on certain product categories and a decline in consumer demand in these product categories could negatively effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly if we are unable to successfully anticipate identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines our sales will be lower potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold inventory in response we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by our ability to adequately source distribute and sell merchandise and other materials on a global basis 

we source merchandise and other materials directly in international markets and in our domestic market we distribute merchandise and other materials globally to our partners in international locations and to our stores many of our imports and exports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements including existing or potential duties tariffs or safeguard quotas we compete with other companies for production facilities 

we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business on a global basis for example 

• political instability environmental hazards or natural disasters which could negatively affect international economies financial markets and business activity 

• significant health hazards or pandemics which could result in closed factories reduced workforces scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas 

• imposition of new or retaliatory trade duties sanctions or taxes and other charges on imports or exports 

• evolving new or complex legal and regulatory matters 

• volatility in currency exchange rates 

• local business practice and political issues including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards which may result in adverse publicity or threatened or actual adverse consumer actions including boycotts 

• potential delays or disruptions in shipping and transportation and related pricing impacts 

• disruption due to labor disputes and 

• changing expectations regarding product safety due to new legislation or other factors 

we also rely upon thirdparty transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments including shipments to and from our distribution centers to our stores and to our customers our utilization of these delivery services for shipments is subject to risks including increases in labor costs and fuel prices which would increase our shipping costs and associate strikes and inclement weather which may impact our transportation providers’ ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs further the rapid increase in demand for online shopping has led to increased pressure on the capacity of our fulfillment network 

for example the covid19 global pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets the covid19 global pandemic resulted in the temporary shutdown of many of our supply chain facilities the pandemic continues to have the potential to significantly impact our supply chain if the factories that manufacture our products the distribution centers where we manage our inventory or the operations of our logistics and other service providers are disrupted temporarily closed or experience worker shortages we may also see disruptions or delays in shipments and negative impacts to pricing of certain components of our products in addition the impact of covid19 on macroeconomic conditions may impact the proper functioning of financial and capital markets foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates even after the covid19 global pandemic has subsided we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur in the future

we rely on a number of vendor and distribution facilities located in the same vicinity making our business susceptible to local and regional disruptions or adverse conditions 

to achieve the necessary speed and agility in producing our beauty personal care and home fragrance products we rely heavily on vendor and distribution facilities in close proximity to our headquarters in central ohio as a result of geographic concentration of the vendor and distribution facilities that we rely upon our operations are susceptible to local and regional factors such as accidents system failures economic and weather conditions natural disasters demographic and population changes and other unforeseen events and circumstances any significant interruption in the operations of these facilities could lead to inventory issues or increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales profits assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition our royalty arrangements are calculated based on sales in local currency and as such we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations although we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency risks these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the shortterm negative impacts of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations hedging would generally not be effective in offsetting the longterm impact of sustained shifts in foreign exchange rates on our business results as a result the fluctuation in the value of the us dollar against other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by our vendors’ ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner meet quality standards and comply with applicable laws and regulations 

we purchase products from thirdparty vendors factors outside our control such as production or shipping delays or quality problems could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales cancellation charges or excessive markdowns 

in addition quality problems could result in a product liability judgment or a widespread product recall that may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability competition reaction and consumer attitudes even if the product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertions could adversely impact our reputation with existing and potential customers and our brand image 

our business could also suffer if our thirdparty vendors fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations while our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our associates visit and monitor the operations of our thirdparty vendors we do not control these vendors or their practices the violation of labor environmental or other laws by thirdparty vendors used by us or the divergence of a thirdparty vendor’s or partner’s labor or environmental practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results may be affected by fluctuations in product input costs 

product input costs including freight labor and raw materials fluctuate these fluctuations may result in an increase in our production costs we may not be able to or may elect not to pass these increases on to our customers which may adversely impact our profit margins these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to adequately protect our assets from loss and theft 

our assets are subject to loss including those caused by illegal or unethical conduct by associates customers vendors or unaffiliated third parties we have experienced events such as inventory shrinkage in the past and we cannot assure that incidences of loss and theft will decrease in the future or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce these losses higher rates of loss or increased security costs to combat theft could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results may be affected by fluctuations in energy costs 

energy costs have fluctuated in the past these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase products from our manufacturers a continual rise in energy costs could

adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by increases in the cost of mailing paper printing or other order fulfillment logistics 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and promotional mailings we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to recover these costs or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing mailing delivery and order fulfillment systems we may face unexpected costs in transportation warehousing or other logisticsrelated services these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we selfinsure certain risks and may be impacted by unfavorable claims experience 

we are selfinsured for various types of insurable risks including associate medical benefits workers’ compensation property general liability and automobile up to certain stoploss limits claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile any adverse claims experience could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we significantly rely on our and our thirdparty service providers ability to implement and sustain information technology systems and to protect associated data and system availability 

our success depends in part on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our and our thirdparty services providers and vendors information technology systems our information technology systems as well as those of our service providers and vendors are vulnerable to damage interruption or breach from a variety of sources including cyberattacks ransomware attacks telecommunication failures malicious human acts and natural disasters moreover despite maintaining comprehensive measures some of our systems ecommerce environments servers and those of our service providers and vendors are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses and similar disruptive problems such incidents could disrupt our operations including our ability to timely ship and track product orders and project inventory requirements and lead to interruptions or delays in our supply chain additionally these types of problems could result in an actual or perceived breach of confidential customer merchandise financial employee or other important information including personal information which could result in damage to our reputation costly litigation customer complaints negative publicity breach notification obligations regulatory or administrative sanctions inquiries orders or investigations indemnity obligations damages for contract breach or penalties for violations of applicable laws or regulations the increased use of smartphones tablets and other mobile devices may also heighten these and other operational risks despite the precautions we have taken unanticipated problems or events may nevertheless cause failures in or unauthorized access to our and our thirdparty services providers’ and vendors information technology systems sustained or repeated system disruptions that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores impact our customers’ ability to access our websites in a timely manner or expose confidential customer information merchandise financial or other important information including personal information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition from time to time we make hardware software and code modifications and upgrades to our information technology systems for pointofsale ecommerce mobile apps merchandising planning sourcing logistics inventory management and support systems including human resources and finance modifications involve replacing existing systems with successor systems making changes to existing systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing and modifying our information technology systems including risks relative to data integrity and system disruptions information technology system disruptions or data corruption if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition to our own systems networks and databases we use thirdparty service providers to store transmit and otherwise process certain of this information on our behalf and our thirdparty service providers are subject to similar cybersecurity risks due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations we may be held responsible for any cybersecurity incident attributed to our service providers as they relate to the information we share with them or to which they are granted access although we contractually require these service providers to implement and maintain a standard of security such as implementing reasonable measures we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in their systems

any significant compromise or breach of our data security including the security of customer associate thirdparty or company information could have a material adverse effect on our reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in the operation of our business we collect use transmit and otherwise process a large volume of personal and other confidential proprietary and sensitive information information systems are susceptible to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks any significant compromise or breach of our data security media reports about such an incident whether accurate or not or our failure to make adequate or timely disclosures to the public or law enforcement agencies following any such event whether due to delayed discovery or a failure to follow existing protocols could significantly damage our reputation with our customers associates investors and other third parties cause the disclosure of personal confidential proprietary or sensitive customer associate thirdparty or company information cause interruptions to our operations and distraction to our management cause our customers to stop shopping with us and result in significant legal regulatory and financial liabilities and lost revenues 

while we train our associates and have implemented systems processes and security measures to protect our physical facilities and information technology systems against unauthorized access and prevent data loss there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security threats despite these measures we may be vulnerable to targeted or random attacks on our systems that could lead to security breaches phishing attacks denial of service attacks acts of vandalism computer viruses malware ransomware misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or similar events our systems and facilities are also subject to compromise from internal threats such as theft misuse unauthorized access or other improper actions by employees thirdparty service providers and other third parties with otherwise legitimate access to our systems website or facilities which risks may be heightened as a result of workfromhome policies and technologies implemented in the wake of the covid19 pandemic furthermore because the methods of cyberattack and deception change frequently are increasingly complex and sophisticated and can originate from a wide variety of sources including nationstate actors despite our reasonable efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and website it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate detect appropriately react and respond to or implement effective preventative measures against all cybersecurity incidents 

we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against respond to and recover from any potential attempted or existing cybersecurity incidents as cybersecurity incidents continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities in addition our remediation efforts may not be successful or may not be completed in a timely manner the inability to implement maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flow moreover there could be public announcements regarding any cybersecurity incidents and any steps we take to respond to or remediate such incidents and if securities analysts or investors perceive these announcements to be negative it could among other things have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock 

while we currently maintain cybersecurity insurance such insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to breaches failures or other data securityrelated incidents and we cannot be certain that cyber insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

risks related to our common stock 

our stock price may be volatile 

our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry any guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe are reasonably attainable at the time guidance is given if or when we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us outside investment analysts or others our stock price could be adversely affected investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk 

the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of listed companies in particular our common stock may in the future be traded by short sellers which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock further influencing volatility in its market price public perception and other factors outside of our control may additionally impact the stock price of companies like us that garner a disproportionate degree of public attention regardless of actual operating performance 

table of c ontents 

if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be impacted 

in march 2021 our board of directors reinstated our annual dividend at  060 per share beginning with the quarterly dividend to be paid in june 2021 our dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future this ability may be subject to certain economic financial competitive and other factors that are beyond our control our board of directors may at its discretion decrease the level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation investor confidence in us and our stock price 

shareholder activism could cause us to incur significant expense hinder execution of our business strategy and impact our stock price 

shareholder activism which can take many forms and arise in a variety of situations could result in substantial costs and divert management’s and our board’s attention and resources from our business additionally such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future adversely affect our relationships with our associates customers or service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel also we may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters including for thirdparty advisors our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events risks and uncertainties of any shareholder activism 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our ability to maintain our credit rating could affect our ability to access capital and could increase our interest expense 

the credit rating agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings a deterioration in our capital structure or the quality and stability of our earnings could result in a downgrade of our credit rating any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive if our ability to access capital becomes constrained our interest costs will likely increase which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows additionally changes to our credit rating could affect our future interest costs 

we may be unable to service or refinance our debt or maintain compliance with restrictive covenants in our debt instruments including our assetbacked revolving credit facility 

we currently have substantial indebtedness our assetbacked revolving credit facility contains a covenant which under certain circumstances requires maintenance of a certain financial ratio and also under certain conditions restrict our ability to pay dividends repurchase common shares and make other restricted payments as defined in the agreement our cash flow from operations provides the primary source of funds for our debt service payments if our cash flow from operations declines we may be unable to service or refinance our current debt if we fail to comply with any covenant including our financial covenant it could result in an event of default and our lenders could terminate the commitments under our assetbacked revolving credit facility as well as certain foreign borrowing facilities and make the entire debt incurred thereunder immediately due and payable or we may be forced to sell assets restructure our indebtedness or seek additional equity capital which would dilute our stockholders’ interests 

risks related to law and regulation 

changes in laws regulations or technology platform rules relating to data privacy and security or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or contractual or other obligations relating to data privacy and security could have a material adverse effect on our reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we are and may increasingly become subject to various laws directives industry standards and regulations as well as contractual obligations relating to data privacy and security in the jurisdictions in which we operate the regulatory environment related to data privacy and security is increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future these laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and it is possible that they will be interpreted and applied in ways that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in the us various federal and state regulators including governmental agencies like the consumer financial protection bureau and the federal trade commission have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations concerning 

table of c ontents 

personal information and data security and have prioritized privacy and information security violations for enforcement actions certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope or offer greater individual rights with respect to personal information than federal international or other state laws and such laws may differ from each other all of which may complicate compliance efforts for example the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which increases privacy rights for california residents and imposes obligations on companies that process their personal information went into effect on january 1 2020 among other things the ccpa requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to california consumers and provide such consumers new data protection and privacy rights including the ability to optout of certain data sharing arrangements of personal information and the ability to access and delete personal information the ccpa provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information this private right of action may increase the likelihood of and risks associated with data breach litigation furthermore in november 2020 california voters passed the california privacy rights act of 2020 “cpra” effective beginning january 1 2023 the cpra imposes additional obligations on companies covered by the legislation and will significantly modify the ccpa including by expanding california residents’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information the cpra also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the ccpa and cpra other states such as virginia also plan to pass data privacy laws that are similar to the ccpa cpra and gdpr described below further complicating the legal landscape in addition laws in all 50 us states require businesses to provide notice to consumers and in some cases to regulators whose personal information has been accessed or acquired as a result of a data breach state laws are changing rapidly and there is discussion in congress of a new comprehensive federal data privacy law to which we would become subject if it is enacted which may add additional complexity variation in requirements restrictions and potential legal risk require additional investment of resources in compliance programs impact strategies and the availability of previously useful data and could result in increased compliance costs or changes in business practices and policies 

we are also subject to international laws regulations and standards in many jurisdictions which apply broadly to the collection use retention security disclosure transfer and other processing of personal information for example the eu general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 greatly increased the european commission’s jurisdictional reach of its laws and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data eu member states are tasked under the gdpr to enact and have enacted certain implementing legislation that adds to andor further interprets the gdpr requirements and potentially extends our obligations and potential liability for failing to meet such obligations the gdpr together with national legislation regulations and guidelines of the eu member states and the united kingdom governing the processing of personal data impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect use retain protect disclose transfer and otherwise process personal data in particular the gdpr includes obligations and restrictions concerning data transparency and consent the overall rights of individuals to whom the personal data relates the transfer of personal data out of the european economic area eea or the united kingdom security breach notifications and the security and confidentiality of personal data the gdpr authorizes fines for certain violations of up to 4 of global annual revenue or €20 million whichever is greater recent legal developments in europe have created further complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from the eea and the united kingdom to the united states most recently in july 2020 the court of justice the european union “cjeu” invalidated the euus privacy shield framework “privacy shield” under which personal data could be transferred from the eea to the united states while the cjeu upheld the adequacy of standard contractual clauses a standard form of contract approved by the european commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism and potential alternative to the privacy shield it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances further the united kingdom’s decision to leave the eu has created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the united kingdom as of january 1 2021 we are also subject to the uk gdpr and uk data protection act of 2018 which retains the gdpr in the united kingdom’s national law these recent developments will require us to review and amend the legal mechanisms by which we make andor receive personal data transfers as supervisory authorities issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms including circumstances where the standard contractual clauses and other mechanisms cannot be used andor start taking enforcement action we could suffer additional costs complaints andor regulatory investigations or fines or if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate it could affect the manner in which we do business the geographical location or segregation of our relevant operations and could adversely affect our financial results 

all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs such as costs related to organizational changes implementing additional protection technologies training associates and engaging consultants which are likely to increase over time in addition such requirements may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies distract management or divert resources from other initiatives and projects all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any applicable federal state or similar foreign laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security could result in damage to our reputation and our relationship with our customers as well as proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies or customers including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions which could subject us to significant fines sanctions awards

it can be difficult to comply with sometimes conflicting regulations in local national or foreign jurisdictions as well as new or changing regulations also changes in such laws could make operating our business more expensive or require us to change the way we do business for example changes in product safety or other consumer protection laws could lead to increased costs for certain merchandise or additional labor costs associated with readying merchandise for sale it may be difficult for us to oversee regulatory changes impacting our business and our responses to changes in the law could be costly and may negatively impact our operations 

we may be adversely impacted by certain compliance or legal matters 

we along with third parties we do business with are subject to complex compliance and litigation risks actions filed against us from time to time include commercial tort intellectual property customer employment wage and hour data privacy securities anticorruption and other claims including purported class action lawsuits in addition notwithstanding our adoption of cdcrecommended guidelines and preventative efforts to ensure the health and safety of our customers and employees it is possible that our customers and employees may contract covid19 while at our stores or facilities which could subject us to litigation the cost of defending against these types of claims against us or the ultimate resolution of such claims whether by settlement or adverse court decision may harm our business further potential claimants may be encouraged to bring suits based on a settlement from us or adverse court decisions against us we cannot currently assess the likely outcome of such suits but if the outcome were negative it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows

there is increased uncertainty with respect to tax policy and trade relations between the us and other countries including as a result of any executive action taken or legislative priorities set by the current biden administration major developments in tax policy or trade relations such as the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

we and certain of our 100 owned subsidiaries guarantee and pledge collateral to secure a revolving credit facility the credit agreement in april 2020 we entered into an amendment and restatement the amendment of the credit agreement to convert our credit facility into an assetbacked revolving credit facility the amendment maintains the aggregate commitments at 1 billion and maintains the expiration date in august of 2024 the abl facility allows borrowings and letters of credit in us dollars or canadian dollars 

availability under the abl facility is the lesser of i the borrowing base determined primarily based on our eligible us and canadian credit card receivables accounts receivable inventory and eligible real property or ii the aggregate commitment if at any time the outstanding amount under the abl facility exceeds the lesser of i the borrowing base and ii the aggregate commitment we will be required to prepay the outstanding amounts under the abl facility to the extent of such excess in addition at any time that our consolidated cash balance exceeds 350 million we will be required to prepay outstanding amounts under the abl facility to the extent of such excess as of january 30 2021 our borrowing base was 853 million but we were unable to draw upon the abl facility as our consolidated cash balance exceeded 350 million 

the abl facility supports our letter of credit program we had 63 million of outstanding letters of credit as of january 30 2021 that reduced our availability under the abl facility 

as of january 30 2021 the abl facility fees related to committed and unutilized amounts were 030 per annum and the fees related to outstanding letters of credit were 175 per annum in addition the interest rate on outstanding us dollar borrowings was the london interbank offered rate libor plus 175 per annum the interest rate on outstanding canadian dollardenominated borrowings was the canadian dollar offered rate cdor plus 175 per annum 

the abl facility requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 100 to 100 during an event of default or any period commencing on any day when specified excess availability is less than the greater of 1 100 million or 2 15 of the maximum borrowing amount as of january 30 2021 we were not required to maintain this ratio 

in march 2020 in an abundance of caution and as a proactive measure in response to the covid19 pandemic we elected to borrow 950 million from our revolving facility which was repaid upon the completion of the amendment as of january 30 2021 there were no borrowings outstanding under the abl facility 

foreign facilities

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

credit losses 

in june 2016 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201613 financial instruments  credit losses which requires the use of a forwardlooking expected loss impairment model for accounts receivable and certain other financial instruments we adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2020 the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

guarantor reporting 

in march 2020 the sec issued a final rule financial disclosures about guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities and affiliates whose securities collateralize a registrant’s securities  that simplifies the disclosure requirements related to registered securities under rule 310 of regulation sx the rule replaces the requirement to provide condensed consolidating financial information with a requirement to present summarized financial information of the issuers and guarantors it also requires qualitative disclosures with respect to information about guarantors the terms and conditions of guarantees and the factors that may affect payment these disclosures may be provided outside the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements we early adopted the reporting requirements of the rule in the first quarter of 2020 and elected to provide these disclosures in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

impact of inflation 

while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required we believe the effects of inflation if any on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor 

table of c ontents 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements on an ongoing basis management evaluates its accounting policies estimates and judgments including those related to inventories longlived assets claims and contingencies income taxes and revenue recognition management bases our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position 

inventories 

inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value on an average cost basis 

we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of inventory on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

we also record inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory these estimates are based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends 

management believes that the assumptions used in these estimates are reasonable and appropriate a 10 increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 5 million for 2020 a 10 increase or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 4 million for 2020 

valuation of longlived assets 

longlived store assets 

longlived store assets which include leasehold improvements store related assets and operating lease assets subsequent to the adoption of asc 842 leases  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable store assets are grouped at the lowest level for which they are largely independent of other assets or asset groups if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset group are less than the carrying value we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset group for operating lease assets we determine the fair value of the assets by comparing the contractual rent payments to estimated market rental rates an individual asset within an asset group is not impaired below its estimated fair value the fair value of longlived store assets are determined using level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy 

in 2020 we executed a rationalization of the victoria’s secret companyoperated store footprint we permanently closed 241 stores in north america in 2020 given the closures in 2020 as well as the negative operating results of certain victorias secret stores in 2020 2019 and 2018 we reviewed the longlived store assets for potential impairment in all periods presented we determined that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying values for certain victorias secret asset groups and as a result determined the estimated fair values of the store asset groups using estimated discounted future cash flows and estimated market rental rates 

the following table provides pretax longlived store asset impairment charges included in the consolidated statement of income loss for 2020 2019 and 2018 



our fair value estimates incorporated significant assumptions and judgments including but not limited to estimated future cash flows discount rates and market rental rates the use of different assumptions or judgments in our assessment could materially 

table of c ontents 

increase or decrease the fair value of our store assets and accordingly could materially increase or decrease any related impairment charge sustained declines in our business performance could result in a material impairment charge in a future period 

when a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life 

goodwill 

goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change we have the option to either first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that each reporting units fair value is less than its carrying value including goodwill or to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment which requires a comparison of the reporting units fair value to its carrying value including goodwill if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit our reporting units are determined in accordance with the provisions of asc 350 intangibles  goodwill and other during 2019 we impaired the goodwill at the victoria’s secret and victoria’s secret greater china reporting units resulting in pretax impairment charges of 720 million as a result only the bath  body works reporting unit has goodwill as of january 30 2021 

as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment over the bath  body works reporting unit we performed a qualitative assessment and determined that the bath  body works reporting units fair value was greater than its carrying value including goodwill declines in our market capitalization or in our business performance could result in a material impairment charge in a future period 

trade names 

the bath  body works and victorias secret trade names are intangible assets with indefinite lives intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change we have the option to either first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired or to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment which requires a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value to determine if the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount we will estimate the fair value usually determined by the relief from royalty method under the income approach and compare that value with its carrying amount if the carrying value of the trade name exceeds its fair value we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference 

as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 we performed our annual impairment assessments of the bath  body works and victorias secret trade names to estimate the fair value of the trade names we used the relief from royalty method under the income approach the annual assessments concluded that the fair values of the trade names were in excess of their respective carrying values 

the use of different assumptions or judgments in our impairment assessment of our trade names including with respect to the estimated future cash flows the discount rate used to discount such estimated future cash flows to their net present value and royalty rates used for the relief from royalty method could materially increase or decrease the fair value of our trade names a 50 reduction to our assumed royalty rate would not have resulted in a material impairment charge in 2020 

claims and contingencies 

we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits taxes insurance regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business our determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the consolidated financial statements is based on management’s view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency we consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seek input from both internal and external experts with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business we accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible as opposed to probable or if an estimate is not reasonably determinable disclosure of a material claim or contingency is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and 

table of c ontents 

liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our consolidated statement of income loss in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 

significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities in determining our provision for income taxes we consider permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates our effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings 

we follow the authoritative guidance included in asc 740 income taxes  which contains a twostep approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and for which actual outcomes may differ from forecasted outcomes our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 

our income tax returns like those of most companies are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified we adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue based on the amount we expect to receive when control of the goods or services is transferred to our customer we recognize sales upon customer receipt of merchandise which for direct channel revenues reflect an estimate of shipments that have not yet been received by our customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times our shipping and handling revenues are included in net sales with the related costs included in costs of goods sold buying and occupancy in our consolidated statements of income loss we also provide a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience net sales exclude sales and other similar taxes collected from customers 

we offer certain loyalty programs that allow customers to earn points based on purchasing activity as customers accumulate points and reach point thresholds they can use the points to purchase merchandise in stores or online we allocate revenue to points earned on qualifying purchases and defer recognition until the points are redeemed the amount of revenue deferred is based on the relative standalone selling price method which includes an estimate for points not expected to be redeemed based on historical experience 

we sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers we do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards we recognize revenue from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer in addition we recognize revenue on unredeemed gift cards where the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions gift card breakage gift card breakage revenue is recognized in proportion and over the same period as actual gift card redemptions we determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns gift card breakage is included in net sales in our consolidated statements of income loss 

revenue earned in connection with victoria’s secrets private label credit card arrangement is primarily recognized based on credit card sales and usage and is included in net sales in the consolidated statements of income loss 

we also recognize revenues associated with franchise license wholesale and sourcing arrangements revenue recognized under franchise and license arrangements generally consists of royalties earned and recognized upon sale of merchandise by franchise and license partners to retail customers revenue is generally recognized under wholesale and sourcing arrangements at the time the title passes to the partner 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates we may use derivative financial instruments like 

table of c ontents 

foreign currency forward contracts crosscurrency swaps and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

foreign exchange rate risk 

we have operations in foreign countries which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations our canadian dollar and chinese yuan denominated earnings are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all our merchandise sold in canada and greater china is sourced through us dollar transactions although we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset risks associated with our operations in canada these measures may not succeed in offsetting all the shortterm impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally may not be effective in offsetting the longterm impact of sustained shifts in foreign currency rates 

further although our royalty arrangements with our international partners are denominated in us dollars the royalties we receive in us dollars are calculated based on sales in the local currency as a result our royalties in these arrangements are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

interest rate risk 

our investment portfolio primarily consists of interestbearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which specifies permitted types of investments specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk our investment portfolio is comprised of us government obligations us treasury and aaarated money market funds commercial paper and bank deposits given the shortterm nature and quality of investments in our portfolio we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates 

all our longterm debt as of january 30 2021 has fixed interest rates we will from time to time adjust our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap arrangements our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows 

fair value of financial instruments 

as of january 30 2021 we believe that the carrying values of accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of their short maturity 

the following table provides a summary of the principal value and estimated fair value of outstanding publicly traded debt as of january 30 2021 and february 1 2020

company response to coronavirus 

we are closely monitoring the outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus that was first detected in wuhan china and has since spread globally the coronavirus has been declared by the world health organization to be a “pandemic” has spread to many countries including the us and is impacting worldwide economic activity a public health epidemic including the coronavirus poses the risk that we or our employees contractors suppliers and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an unknown period of time related industries in the us and across the world may be adversely affected including manufacturing and textile production the situation and preventative or protective actions that governments around the world have taken to contain the spread of the coronavirus have resulted in a period of disruption including closure of stores where our products are sold limited store operating hours reduced customer traffic and consumer spending labor shortages and delays in manufacturing and shipping of products and raw materials in the us china and other countries to the extent the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens we may have difficulty obtaining the materials necessary for the manufacturing of our products factories which produce our products may remain closed for sustained periods of time and industrywide shipment of products may be negatively impacted further if the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens consumer behavior may be altered for an extended period of time which would impact our cash and liquidity and financial condition the coronavirus and resulting economic disruption has also led to significant volatility in the capital markets and may adversely impact our stock price and ability to access cash any one adverse effect of the coronavirus or a combination of adverse effects could materially impact our results and financial condition 

subsequent to february 1 2020  we announced actions in response to the continued spread of the coronavirus 

on march 16 2020 in an abundance of caution and as a proactive measure we elected to borrow 950 million from our secured revolving credit facility secured revolving facility leaving our availability under the secured revolving facility at 22 million  

on march 17 2020 we announced the temporary closure of all bath  body works victoria’s secret and pink stores in the united states and canada through march 29 2020 associates will continue to receive pay and benefits through april 4 2020 which is one week longer than originally announced 

based on the continued spread of the coronavirus and stayathome orders by government officials across the country we are extending the closure of our stores beyond the initial march 29th date as the situation continues to evolve rapidly we are not currently able to predict the timing of store reopenings however we are monitoring the situation closely and will provide updates as appropriate we continue to serve customers through our direct channels 

in an effort to further strengthen our financial flexibility and efficiently manage through the pandemic we are proactively taking the following additional actions 

 as of march 27 2020 we currently have more than 2 billion in cash which includes the 950 million borrowed under the secured revolving facility on march 16 2020 our secured revolving facility has certain financial covenants including a debt to consolidated ebitda covenant which may be breached as early as the end of the fiscal quarter ending may 2 2020 if we were to violate a covenant our lenders would have the right to accelerate our secured revolving facility indebtedness demand cash collateral in respect of the letters of credit issued thereunder and terminate the funding commitments available thereunder while we believe that we would be able to obtain temporary waivers for any such breach of a covenant to prevent an acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness or obtain a replacement credit facility we cannot conclude with certainty that we would have the ability to obtain necessary waivers or negotiate less restrictive debt covenants with our lenders we are in active conversations with the lenders under our credit facility to obtain a replacement credit facility that does not contain a debt to consolidated ebitda financial covenant or a temporary waiver in respect of such financial covenant in our existing secured revolving facility we believe that our current cash balance along with the actions taken as outlined above provides us with sufficient current liquidity

 item 1a risk factors 

we caution that any forwardlooking statements as such term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 contained in this report or made by our company or our management involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors many of which are beyond our control accordingly our future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forwardlooking statements words such as “estimate” “project” “plan” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “planned” “potential” and any similar expressions may identify forwardlooking statements risks associated with the following factors among others in some cases have affected and in the future could affect our financial performance and actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forwardlooking statements included in this report or otherwise made by our company or our management 



 we are not under any obligation and do not intend to make publicly available any update or other revisions to any of the forwardlooking statements contained in this report to reflect circumstances existing after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of future events even if experience or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by those forwardlooking statements will not be realized 

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10k other filings or in any other discussions of our business the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and item 8  financial statements and supplementary data 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results the risks described below are not our only risks additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business operating results andor financial condition in a material way 

our net sales profit results and cash flows are sensitive to and may be affected by general economic conditions consumer confidence spending patterns weather significant health hazards or pandemics or other market disruptions 

our net sales profit cash flows and future growth may be affected by negative local regional national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers’ ability or willingness to spend including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war terrorism or the threat thereof in addition market disruptions due to natural disasters significant health hazards or pandemics or other major events or the prospect of these events could also impact consumer spending and confidence levels extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located particularly in markets where we have multiple stores could adversely affect our business purchases of women’s intimate and other apparel beauty and personal care products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak in such circumstances we may increase the number of promotional sales which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we are closely monitoring the outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus that was first detected in wuhan china and has since spread globally the coronavirus has been declared by the world health organization to be a “pandemic” has spread to many countries including the us and is impacting worldwide economic activity a public health epidemic including the coronavirus poses the risk that the we or our employees contractors suppliers and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an unknown period of time related industries in the us and across the world may be adversely effected including manufacturing and textile production the situation and preventative or protective actions that governments around the world have taken to contain the spread of the coronavirus have resulted in a period of disruption including closure of stores where our products are sold limited store operating hours reduced customer traffic and 

consumer spending labor shortages or the extended furlough of our employees and delays in manufacturing and shipping of products and raw materials in the us china and other countries to the extent the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens we may have difficulty obtaining the materials necessary for the manufacturing of our products factories which produce our products may remain closed for sustained periods of time and industrywide shipment of products may be negatively impacted further if the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens consumer behavior may be altered for an extended period of time which would impact our cash and liquidity and financial condition the coronavirus and resulting economic disruption has also led to significant volatility in the capital markets and may adversely impact our stock price and ability to access cash any one adverse effect of the coronavirus or a combination of adverse effects could materially impact our results and financial condition our actual results could differ materially from our guidance due to this risk and other uncertainties and factors 

recently the decision by the uk to leave the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” has increased the uncertainty in the economic and political environment in europe ongoing uncertainty remains as to what kind of postbrexit agreement between the uk and the european union if any may be approved by the uk parliament our business in the uk may be adversely impacted by this uncertainty fluctuations in currency exchange rates changes in trade policies or changes in labor immigration tax or other laws 

our net sales operating income cash and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis 

we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

seasonal fluctuations also affect our cash and inventory levels since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases we must carry a significant amount of inventory especially before the holiday season selling period if we are not successful in selling inventory we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we have entered into an agreement pursuant to which we will transfer certain assets and liabilities relating to our business conducted under the victoria’s secret and pink brands the “victoria’s secret business” to a newly formed subsidiary “victoria’s secret holdco” and sell 55 of the equity interests of victoria’s secret holdco to an affiliate of sycamore partners management lp “sycamore” the proposed vs transaction involves risks including risks that the proposed transaction may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits 

the vs transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020 subject to customary closing conditions including 1 the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the hartscott rodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 as amended 2 the receipt of approval under the competition act of canada 3 the absence of any applicable law injunction or other judgment that prohibits the closing and iv the completion of certain restructuring transactions in addition each of our and sycamore’s obligation to complete the vs transaction is subject to among other things the accuracy of the other party’s representations and warranties in the transaction agreement subject in most cases to “material” and “material adverse effect” qualifications and the other party’s compliance with its covenants and agreements in the transaction agreement in all material respects the transaction agreement provides that we or sycamore may choose not to proceed with the vs transaction if the vs transaction has not been completed by august 20 2020 which date may be extended by either party to november 20 2020 under certain circumstances where the restructuring transactions have not been completed pending governmental approvals 

the satisfaction of the required conditions could delay the consummation of the proposed transaction with sycamore or prevent it from occurring further there can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the proposed transaction will be satisfied or waived or that the proposed transaction will be consummated with respect to regulatory approvals there can be no assurance that the required regulatory approvals will be received in a timely manner or at all or that such approvals will not contain adverse conditions failure to consummate the proposed transaction in a timely manner or at all could negatively impact the market price of our common stock as well as our future business and its financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

assuming the vs transaction is completed there can be no assurance that we will be able to realize the anticipated value and benefits therefrom and the vs transaction may adversely affect our business the proposed transaction will result in a smaller less diversified and more narrowly focused business than before the vs transaction which makes us more vulnerable to changing market and economic conditions additionally a potential loss of synergies from separating the businesses could negatively impact our balance sheet profit margins or earnings and the price of our common stock may not be equal to or 

greater than the value of our common stock had the vs transaction not occurred if we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the vs transaction or do not achieve them in the time we expect our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the vs transaction is pending 

uncertainty about the effect of the vs transaction on employees commercial partners and vendors may have an adverse effect on us these uncertainties may impair our ability to retain and motivate key personnel and could cause commercial partners vendors and others that deal with us to defer or decline entering into contracts with us or seek to change existing business relationships with us certain of our contracts contain restrictions that may give rise to a right of termination or cancellation in connection with the vs transaction in addition if key employees depart because of uncertainty about their future roles and the potential complexities of the vs transaction our business could be harmed furthermore the transaction agreement contains restrictions on our ability take certain actions relating to the victoria’s secret business outside the ordinary course of business prior to the closing which may delay or prevent us from undertaking certain actions or business opportunities that may arise prior to the closing 

turnover in company leadership or other key positions may have an adverse impact on company performance 

upon the consummation of the vs transaction our current chief executive officer ceo will step down and a new ceo will be appointed leslie h wexner will step down from his position as our ceo and chairman of the board after leading the company for more than five decades mr wexner will remain a member of the board as chairman emeritus andrew meslow the current chief executive officer of bath  body works will become our new ceo and will be appointed as a member of the board sarah e nash a member of the board will be appointed as the chair of the board effective upon closing additionally current lead independent director allan tessler as well as directors gordon gee and raymond zimmerman will retire as of the date of the annual meeting and upon mr tesslers retirement ms nash will serve as lead independent director such leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage and an inadequate transition of our ceo may cause disruption to our business including to our relationships with vendors and employees 

we may well experience further changes in key leadership or key positions in the future the departure of key leadership personnel especially a longserving ceo can take from the company significant knowledge and experience this loss of knowledge and experience can be mitigated through successful hiring and transition but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such efforts attracting and retaining qualified senior leadership may be more challenging under adverse business conditions failure to attract and retain the right talent or to smoothly manage the transition of responsibilities resulting from such turnover would affect our ability to meet our challenges and may cause us to miss performance objectives or financial targets or disrupt our relationships with our customers 

we may be impacted by our ability to attract develop and retain qualified associates and manage laborrelated costs 

we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer which requires us to have highly trained and engaged associates our success depends in part upon our ability to attract develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified associates including store personnel and talented merchants the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas competition for such qualified individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand delayed store openings significant increases in associate turnover rates or significant increases in laborrelated costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

retained or contingent liabilities from businesses that we divest could adversely affect our financial results our continued involvement with victoria’s secret holdco is also subject to various arrangements and conditions outside of our control could affect our future results 

in the fourth quarter of 2018 we completed the sale of la senza to an affiliate of regent lp a global private equity firm and in the first quarter of 2020 we signed a transaction agreement with sycamore to effect the vs transaction as a result of the la senza divestiture and upon the consummation of the vs transaction we may incur unexpected contingent liabilities including with respect to leases assumed by the buyer our divestiture activities may also present financial and operational risks those risks may include difficulties separating personnel financial and other systems and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyer of la senza andor victoria’s secret holdco any of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition we will continue to have financial involvement with victoria’s secret holdco after the closing including through our 45 interest in victoria’s secret holdco transition services agreements and guarantees 

under these arrangements performance by victoria’s secret holdco or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future results 

our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space 

most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers sales at these stores are derived in part from the volume of traffic in those retail areas our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area including “destination” retail stores to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by factors that we cannot control such as economic downturns or changes in consumer demographics in a particular area consumer trends away from brickandmortar retail toward online shopping competition from internet and other retailers and other retail areas where we do not have stores significant health hazards or pandemics the closing of other stores or the decline in popularity or safety in the shopping areas where our stores are located and the deterioration in the financial condition of the operators or developers of the shopping areas in which our stores are located 

part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs some of our store locations require significant upfront capital investment and have material lease commitments additionally we are dependent upon the suitability of the lease spaces that we currently use the leases that we enter into are generally noncancelable leases with initial terms of 10 years if we determine that it is no longer economical to operate a store and decide to close it we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new stores into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our plans for international expansion include risks that could impact our results and reputation 

we intend to further expand into international markets including mainland china through partner arrangements andor companyowned stores the risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market any of these difficulties may lead to disruption in the overall timing of our international expansion efforts or increased costs further entry into other markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence other risks include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets volatility in the geopolitical landscape restrictions on the repatriation of funds held internationally disruptions or delays in shipments occurrence of significant health hazards or pandemics changes in diplomatic and trade relationships political instability and foreign governmental regulation for example in december 2019 a strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in wuhan china resulting in temporary store closures and a decrease in consumer traffic in china to date this virus has begun to spread globally we expect the coronavirus to negatively impact our results of operations particularly in the greater china business and our plans for expansion in china though the extent and duration of this impact remain uncertain to the extent the impact of the coronavirus continues or worsens we may have difficulty obtaining the materials necessary for the manufacturing of our products factories which produce our products may remain closed for sustained periods of time and industrywide shipment of products may be negatively impacts such expansions will also have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance 

we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners in addition certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store openings and sales and their compliance with federal and local law we cannot ensure the profitability or success of our expansion into international markets 

  

further our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates see “fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations” below 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our licensees franchisees and wholesalers could take actions that could harm our business or brand images 

we have global representation through independently owned stores operated by our partners although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective partners the level of control we can exercise over our partners is limited and the quality and success of their operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control for example our partners may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel our brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our partners do not operate successfully these risks could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our direct channel businesses include risks that could have an effect on our results 

our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results risks include but are not limited to the difficulty in recreating the instore experience through our direct channels domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it outside our control our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in technology and logistics in order to appeal to existing and potential customers who increasingly rely on multiple channels to meet their shopping needs the failure of and risks related to the systems that operate our web infrastructure websites and the related support systems including computer viruses theft of customer information privacy concerns telecommunication failures and electronic breakins and similar disruptions 

our failure to maintain efficient and uninterrupted ordertaking and fulfillment operations could also have a material adverse effect on our results the satisfaction of our online customers depends on their timely receipt of merchandise if we encounter difficulties with the distribution facilities or if the facilities were to shut down for any reason including as a result of fire natural disaster or work stoppage we could face shortages of inventory incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers and cause customer dissatisfaction 

any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to protect our reputation could have a material effect on our brand images 

our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity any negative publicity including information publicized through traditional or social media platforms and similar venues such as blogs websites and other forums may affect our reputation and brand and consequently reduce demand for our merchandise even if such publicity is unverified or inaccurate 

failure to comply with or the perception that the company has failed to comply with ethical social product labor and environmental standards or related political considerations could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions including boycotts failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls to maintain the security of customer associate thirdparty or company information or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

if our marketing advertising and promotional programs are unsuccessful or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are our revenue or results of operations may be adversely affected 

customer traffic and demand for our merchandise are influenced by our advertising marketing and promotional activities the name recognition and reputation of our brands and the location of and service offered in our stores although we use marketing advertising and promotional programs to attract customers through various media including social media websites mobile applications email print and television some of our competitors may expend more for their programs than we do or use different approaches than we do which may provide them with a competitive advantage our programs may not be effective or could require increased expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations 

our ability to adequately protect our trade names trademarks and patents could have an impact on our brand images and ability to penetrate new markets 

we believe that our trade names trademarks and patents are important assets and an essential element of our strategy we have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names trademarks and patents and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries there can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others in particular the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if any thirdparty copies our products or our stores in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation it could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could impact our results 

the sale of women’s intimate and other apparel personal care products and accessories is highly competitive we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers including individual and chain specialty stores department stores and discount retailers in addition to the traditional storebased retailers we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through online channels brand image marketing design price service assortment quality image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the storebased and online channels 

some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing and other resources available and trends across our product categories may favor our competitors we rely to a greater degree than some of our competitors on physical locations in shopping malls and centers and so declines in traffic to such locations may affect us more significantly than our competitors some of our competitors sell their products in stores that are located in the same shopping malls and centers as our stores in addition to competing for sales we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls and centers 

increased competition combined with declines in mall traffic could result in price reductions increased marketing expenditures and loss of pricing power and market share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to manage the life cycle of our brands and to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could impact the image and relevance of our brands 

our success depends in part on management’s ability to effectively manage the life cycle of our brands and to anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate salable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly if we are unable to successfully anticipate identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines our sales will be lower potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory in response we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by our ability to adequately source distribute and sell merchandise and other materials on a global basis 

we source merchandise and other materials directly in international markets and in our domestic market we distribute merchandise and other materials globally to our partners in international locations and to our stores many of our imports and exports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements including existing or potential duties tariffs or safeguard quotas we compete with other companies for production facilities 

we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business on a global basis for example 



 we also rely upon thirdparty transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments including shipments to and from our distribution centers to our stores and to our customers our utilization of these delivery services for shipments is subject to risks including increases in labor costs and fuel prices which would increase our shipping costs and associate strikes and inclement weather which may impact our transportation providers’ ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs 

for example the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus first identified in wuhan china has led to work and travel restrictions within to and out of mainland china which in turn has led to delays in textile mill and factory openings and delays in workers returning following the chinese new year holiday to date this virus has begun to spread globally and various governments have either enforced further restrictions or have begun pondering taking action soon these restrictions and delays which may further expand depending on the progression of the illness may make it difficult for our suppliers to source raw materials in china manufacture finished goods in china and export our products from china additionally our suppliers throughout asia source a significant amount of fabric from china if the severity and reach of the coronavirus outbreak increases there may be significant and material disruptions to our supply chain and operations and delays in the manufacture and shipment of our products which may then have a material adverse effect on our results of operations our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and the occurrence or deepening impact of one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we rely on a number of vendor and distribution facilities located in the same vicinity making our business susceptible to local and regional disruptions or adverse conditions 

to achieve the necessary speed and agility in producing our beauty personal care and home fragrance products we rely heavily on vendor and distribution facilities in close proximity to our headquarters in central ohio as a result of geographic concentration of the vendor and distribution facilities that we rely upon our operations are susceptible to local and regional factors such as accidents system failures economic and weather conditions natural disasters demographic and population changes and other unforeseen events and circumstances any significant interruption in the operations of these facilities could lead to inventory issues or increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales profits assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition our royalty arrangements are calculated based on sales in local currency and as such we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations although we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency risks these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the shortterm negative impacts of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations hedging would generally not be effective in offsetting the longterm impact of sustained shifts in foreign exchange rates on our business results as a result the fluctuation in the value of the us dollar against other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our stock price may be volatile 

our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry any guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe are reasonably attainable at the time guidance is given if or when we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us outside investment analysts or others our stock price could be adversely affected investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk 

in addition the stock market may experience price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance 

on march 27 2020 our board of directors announced that it planned to suspend our annual ordinary dividend beginning with the quarterly dividend to be paid in our second fiscal quarter in 2020 there can be no assurance if when and at what level our board of directors may resume making dividend payments 

on march 27 2020 our board of directors announced that it planned to suspend our annual ordinary dividend beginning with the quarterly dividend to be paid in our second fiscal quarter in 2020 while we remain committed to paying dividends over the longterm and will reevaluate when appropriate there can be no assurance if when and at what level our board of directors may resume making dividend payments our dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow our ability to pay dividends depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future this ability is subject to certain economic financial competitive and other factors that are beyond our control our failure to pay dividends may negatively impact our stock price 

our ability to maintain our credit rating could affect our ability to access capital and could increase our interest expense 

the credit rating agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings a deterioration in our capital structure or the quality and stability of our earnings could result in a downgrade of our credit rating any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive if our ability to access capital becomes constrained our interest costs will likely increase which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows additionally changes to our credit rating could affect our future interest costs 

if we breach covenants in our secured revolving facility our ability to service or refinance our debt as well as our financial stability may be impacted 

we currently have substantial indebtedness our secured revolving facility contains covenants which require maintenance of certain financial ratios and also under certain conditions restrict our ability to pay dividends repurchase common shares and make other restricted payments as defined in the agreement our cash flow from operations provides the primary source of funds for our debt service payments if our cash flow from operations declines we may be unable to service or refinance our current debt or make certain restricted payments as defined in our secured revolving facility if we fail to comply with any covenant including our financial maintenance covenants it could result in an event of default and our lenders could terminate the commitments under our secured revolving facility as well as certain foreign borrowing facilities and make the entire debt incurred thereunder immediately due and payable or we may be forced to sell assets restructure our indebtedness or seek additional equity capital which would dilute our stockholders’ interests in particular as of march 27 2020 we currently have more than 2 billion in cash which includes the 950 million borrowed under the secured revolving facility on march 16 2020 however our secured revolving facility has certain financial covenants including a debt to consolidated ebitda covenant which may be breached as early as the end of the fiscal quarter ending may 2 2020 we are in active conversations with our lenders regarding a temporary waiver in respect of such financial covenant or the possibility of entering into a replacement credit facility without a similar covenant if we are unable to obtain a temporary waiver for that anticipated covenant breach or to obtain a replacement credit facility without a similar covenant our lenders would have the right to accelerate our secured revolving facility indebtedness demand cash collateral in respect of the letters of credit issued thereunder and terminate the funding commitments available thereunder if this occurs we might not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it even if new financing is available it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us 

shareholder activism could cause us to incur significant expense hinder execution of our business strategy and impact our stock price 

shareholder activism which can take many forms and arise in a variety of situations could result in substantial costs and divert management’s and our board’s attention and resources from our business additionally such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future adversely affect our relationships with our associates customers or service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel also we may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters including for thirdparty advisors our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events risks and uncertainties of any shareholder activism 

we may be impacted by our vendors’ ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner meet quality standards and comply with applicable laws and regulations 

we purchase products from thirdparty vendors factors outside our control such as production or shipping delays or quality problems could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales cancellation charges or excessive markdowns 

in addition quality problems could result in a product liability judgment or a widespread product recall that may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability competition reaction and consumer attitudes even if the product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertions could adversely impact our reputation with existing and potential customers and our brand image 

our business could also suffer if our thirdparty vendors fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations while our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our associates visit and monitor the operations of our thirdparty vendors we do not control these vendors or their practices the violation of labor environmental or other laws by thirdparty vendors used by us or the divergence of a thirdparty vendor’s or partner’s labor or environmental practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results may be affected by fluctuations in product input costs 

product input costs including freight labor and raw materials fluctuate these fluctuations may result in an increase in our production costs we may not be able to or may elect not to pass these increases on to our customers which may adversely impact our profit margins these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to adequately protect our assets from loss and theft 

our assets are subject to loss including those caused by illegal or unethical conduct by associates customers vendors or unaffiliated third parties we have experienced events such as inventory shrinkage in the past and we cannot assure that incidences of loss and theft will decrease in the future or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce these losses higher rates of loss or increased security costs to combat theft could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results may be affected by fluctuations in energy costs 

energy costs have fluctuated in the past these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase products from our manufacturers a continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by increases in costs of mailing paper and printing 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and promotional mailings we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to recover these costs or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing mailing delivery and order fulfillment systems these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we selfinsure certain risks and may be impacted by unfavorable claims experience 

we are selfinsured for various types of insurable risks including associate medical benefits workers’ compensation property general liability and automobile up to certain stoploss limits claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile any adverse claims experience could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems and to protect associated data 

our success depends in part on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems our information technology systems as well as those of our service providers are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources including telecommunication failures malicious human acts and natural disasters moreover despite maintaining comprehensive measures some of our systems ecommerce environments servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses and similar disruptive problems additionally these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer merchandise financial employee or other important information including personal information which could result in damage to our reputation andor litigation the increased use of smartphones tablets and other mobile devices may also heighten these and other operational risks despite the precautions we have taken unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems 

sustained or repeated system disruptions that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores impact our customers’ ability to access our websites in a timely manner or expose confidential customer information merchandise financial or other important information including personal information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition from time to time we make hardware software and code modifications and upgrades to our information technology systems for pointofsale ecommerce merchandising planning sourcing logistics inventory management and support systems including human resources and finance modifications involve replacing existing systems with successor systems making changes to existing systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems including not accurately capturing data and system disruptions information technology system disruptions if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition and cash flows 

any significant compromise or breach of our data security including the security of customer associate thirdparty or company information could have a material adverse effect on our reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in the operation of our business we collect use transmit and otherwise process a large volume of personal and other confidential proprietary and sensitive information information systems are susceptible to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks any significant compromise or breach of our data security media reports about such an incident whether accurate or not or our failure to make adequate or timely disclosures to the public or law enforcement agencies following any such event whether due to delayed discovery or a failure to follow existing protocols could significantly damage our reputation with our customers associates investors and other third parties cause the disclosure of personal confidential proprietary or sensitive customer associate thirdparty or company information cause interruptions to our operations and distraction to our management cause our customers to stop shopping with us and result in significant legal regulatory and financial liabilities and lost revenues 

while we train our associates and have implemented systems processes and confidential security measures to protect our physical facilities and information technology systems against unauthorized access and prevent data loss there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches despite these measures we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches phishing attacks denial of service attacks acts of vandalism computer viruses malware ransomware misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or similar events our systems and facilities are also subject to compromise from internal threats such as theft misuse unauthorized access or other improper actions by employees thirdparty service providers and other third parties with otherwise legitimate access to our systems website or facilities furthermore because the methods of cyberattack and deception change frequently are increasingly complex and sophisticated and can originate from a wide variety of sources including nationstate actors despite our reasonable efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and website it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate detect appropriately react and respond to or implement effective preventative measures against all cybersecurity incidents 

in addition to our own systems networks and databases we use thirdparty service providers to store transmit and otherwise process certain of this information on our behalf due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations we may be held responsible for any cybersecurity incident attributed to our service providers as they relate to the information we share with them or to which they are granted access although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in their systems 

we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against respond to and recover from any potential attempted or existing cybersecurity incidents as cybersecurity incidents continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities in addition our remediation efforts may not be successful the inability to implement maintain and upgrade adequate safeguards could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flow moreover there could be public announcements regarding any cybersecurity incidents and any steps we take to respond to or remediate such incidents and if securities analysts or investors perceive these announcements to be negative it could among other things have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock 

while we currently maintain cybersecurity insurance such insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to breaches failures or other data securityrelated incidents and we cannot be certain that cyber insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance 

coverage or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

changes in laws or regulations relating to data privacy and security or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or contractual or other obligations relating to data privacy and security could have a material adverse effect on our reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we are and may increasingly become subject to various laws and regulations as well as contractual obligations relating to data privacy and security in the jurisdictions in which we operate the regulatory environment related to data privacy and security is increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future these laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and it is possible that they will be interpreted and applied in ways that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in the us various federal and state regulators including governmental agencies like the consumer financial protection bureau and the federal trade commission have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations concerning personal information and data security certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope or offer greater individual rights with respect to personal information than federal international or other state laws and such laws may differ from each other all of which may complicate compliance efforts for example the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which increases privacy rights for california residents and imposes obligations on companies that process their personal information went into effect on january 1 2020 among other things the ccpa requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to california consumers and provide such consumers new data protection and privacy rights including the ability to optout of certain sales of personal information the ccpa provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information this private right of action may increase the likelihood of and risks associated with data breach litigation in addition laws in all 50 us states require businesses to provide notice to consumers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach state laws are changing rapidly and there is discussion in congress of a new comprehensive federal data privacy law to which we would become subject if it is enacted 

we are subject to international laws regulations and standards in many jurisdictions which apply broadly to the collection use retention security disclosure transfer and other processing of personal information for example the eu general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 greatly increased the european commission’s jurisdictional reach of its laws and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data eu member states are tasked under the gdpr to enact and have enacted certain implementing legislation that adds to andor further interprets the gdpr requirements and potentially extends our obligations and potential liability for failing to meet such obligations the gdpr together with national legislation regulations and guidelines of the eu member states and the united kingdom governing the processing of personal data impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect use retain protect disclose transfer and otherwise process personal data in particular the gdpr includes obligations and restrictions concerning the consent and rights of individuals to whom the personal data relates the transfer of personal data out of the european economic area or the united kingdom security breach notifications and the security and confidentiality of personal data the gdpr authorizes fines for certain violations of up to 4 of global annual revenue or €20 million whichever is greater 

all of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs such as costs related to organizational changes implementing additional protection technologies training associates and engaging consultants which are likely to increase over time in addition such requirements may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies distract management or divert resources from other initiatives and projects all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with any applicable federal state or similar foreign laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security could result in damage to our reputation and our relationship with our customers as well as proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies or customers including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions which would subject us to significant fines sanctions awards penalties or judgments all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by our ability to comply with regulatory requirements 

we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements our policies procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable foreign and domestic laws and regulations including those required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act the sec and the new york stock exchange the “nyse” among others although we have put in place policies and procedures aimed at ensuring legal and regulatory compliance our 

associates subcontractors vendors licensees franchisees and other third parties could take actions that violate these laws and regulations any violations of such laws or regulations could have an adverse effect on our reputation market price of our common stock results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

it can be difficult to comply with sometimes conflicting regulations in local national or foreign jurisdictions as well as new or changing regulations also changes in such laws could make operating our business more expensive or require us to change the way we do business for example changes in product safety or other consumer protection laws could lead to increased costs for certain merchandise or additional labor costs associated with readying merchandise for sale it may be difficult for us to oversee regulatory changes impacting our business and our responses to changes in the law could be costly and may negatively impact our operations 

we may be adversely impacted by certain compliance or legal matters 

we along with third parties we do business with are subject to complex compliance and litigation risks actions filed against us from time to time include commercial tort intellectual property customer employment wage and hour data privacy securities anticorruption and other claims including purported class action lawsuits the cost of defending against these types of claims against us or the ultimate resolution of such claims whether by settlement or adverse court decision may harm our business further potential claimants may be encouraged to bring suits based on a settlement from us or adverse court decisions against us we cannot currently assess the likely outcome of such suits but if the outcome were negative it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition we may be impacted by litigation trends including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation the market price of our common stock results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by changes in taxation trade and other regulatory requirements 

we are subject to income tax in local national and international jurisdictions in addition our products are subject to import and excise duties andor sales or valueadded taxes in many jurisdictions we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations fluctuations in tax rates and duties changes in tax legislation or regulation or adverse outcomes of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

there is increased uncertainty with respect to tax policy and trade relations between the us and other countries major developments in tax policy or trade relations such as the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

 2020 outlook 

on february 20 2020 we announced the sale of 55 of the victoria’s secret business to sycamore for proceeds of approximately 525 million the transaction is the result of a comprehensive review of a broad range of options undertaken by our board of directors with input from outside financial advisors designed to best position our brands for longterm success and drive shareholder value we believe this transaction will highlight the value and performance of the standalone bath  body works business enhance management focus and reduce structural complexity 

additionally we believe that a private entity structure creates the best environment for a victoria’s secret turnaround we believe that sycamore which has substantial experience in the retail industry will bring a new perspective and greater focus to the business we are pleased that by retaining a significant ownership stake our shareholders will have the ability to meaningfully participate in the upside potential of this iconic brand 

over the next several months we will be reviewing the functional and corporate support required for the standalone bath  body works business with a view to simplify our existing structure while recognizing that we will still be supporting the victoria’s secret businesses through a transition services agreement with various terms for different services which will minimize nearterm dissynergies

on march 17 2020 we announced the temporary closure of all bath  body works victoria’s secret and pink stores in the united states and canada through march 29 2020 associates will continue to receive pay and benefits through april 4 2020 which is one week longer than originally announced 

based on the continued spread of the coronavirus and stayathome orders by government officials across the country we are extending the closure of our stores beyond the initial march 29th date as the situation continues to evolve rapidly we are not currently able to predict the timing of store reopenings however we are monitoring the situation closely and will provide updates as appropriate we continue to serve customers through our direct channels 

in an effort to further strengthen our financial flexibility and efficiently manage through the pandemic we are proactively taking the following additional actions 

 as of march 27 2020 we currently have more than 2 billion in cash which includes the 950 million borrowed under the secured revolving facility on march 16 2020 our secured revolving facility has certain financial covenants including a debt to consolidated ebitda covenant which may be breached as early as the end of the fiscal quarter ending may 2 2020 if we were to violate a covenant our lenders would have the right to accelerate our secured revolving facility indebtedness demand cash collateral in respect of the letters of credit issued thereunder and terminate the funding commitments available thereunder while we believe that we would be able to obtain temporary waivers for any such breach of a covenant to prevent an acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness or obtain a replacement credit facility we cannot conclude with certainty that we would have the ability to obtain necessary waivers or negotiate less restrictive debt covenants with our lenders we are in active conversations with the lenders under our credit facility to obtain a replacement credit facility that does not contain a debt to consolidated ebitda financial covenant or a temporary waiver in respect of such financial covenant in our existing secured revolving facility we believe that our current cash balance along with the actions taken as outlined above provides us with sufficient current liquidity

off balance sheet arrangements 

we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined by regulation 229303 item 303 a 4 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

leases 

in february 2016 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asc 842 leases  which requires companies classified as lessees to account for most leases on their balance sheet but recognize expense on their income statement in a manner similar to legacy accounting the standard also requires enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures including significant judgments made by management to provide greater insight into the extent of expense recognized and expected to be recognized from existing leases in july 2018 the fasb approved an amendment to the standard that provides companies a modified retrospective transition option that did not require earlier periods to be restated upon adoption 

we adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019 under the modified retrospective approach as allowed by the new standard we elected the package of transition practical expedients but elected to not apply the hindsight practical expedient to its leases at transition 

upon adoption at the beginning of 2019 we recorded operating lease liabilities of 37 billion and operating lease assets for its leases of 33 billion  the operating lease assets are net of 470 million of liabilities for deferred rent and unamortized landlord construction allowances that were previously recorded as other longterm liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet we also recorded a decrease to opening retained earnings net of tax of 2 million  the adoption of the standard did not materially impact the consolidated statements of income loss or cash flows 

hedging activities 

in august 2017 the fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201712 targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities  which is intended to better align risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships the standard eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item it also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements we adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2019 the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

goodwill 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201704 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment  which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill the standard eliminates the second step from the goodwill impairment test which required a hypothetical purchase price allocation to determine the implied fair value of goodwill under the new standard the goodwill impairment charge is the excess of the reporting units carrying value over its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit we adopted this standard in the third quarter of 2019 and performed our interim and annual goodwill impairment assessments in accordance with asu 201704 

credit losses 

in june 2016 the fasb issued asu 201613 financial instruments  credit losses which requires the use of a forwardlooking expected loss impairment model for accounts receivable and certain other financial instruments this guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal 2020 with early adoption permitted we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

impact of inflation 

while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required we believe the effects of inflation if any on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements on an ongoing basis management evaluates its accounting policies estimates and judgments including those related to inventories longlived assets claims and contingencies income taxes and revenue recognition management bases our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position 

inventories 

inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a weightedaverage cost basis 

we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of inventory on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

we also record inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory these estimates are based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends 

management believes that the assumptions used in these estimates are reasonable and appropriate a 10 increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net loss by approximately 4 million for 2019  a 10 increase or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net loss by approximately 5 million for 2019  

valuation of longlived assets 

longlived store assets 

longlived store assets which include leasehold improvements store related assets and operating lease assets subsequent to the adoption of asc 842 leases  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable store assets are grouped at the lowest level for which they are largely independent of other assets or asset groups if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset group are less than the carrying value we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset group for operating lease assets we determine the fair value of the assets by comparing the contractual rent payments to estimated market rental rates an individual asset within an asset group is not impaired below its estimated fair value the fair value of longlived store assets are determined using level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy 

in 2019 and 2018 we concluded that the negative operating results for certain of our victorias secret stores were an indicator of potential impairment of the related store asset groups we determined that the estimated undiscounted future cash flows were less than the carrying values and as a result determined the estimated fair values of the store asset groups using estimated discounted future cash flows and estimated market rental rates accordingly we recognized a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of an asset group and its estimated fair value but did not impair any individual store asset below its estimated fair value 

in 2019 we recognized impairment charges of 198 million for leasehold improvements and store related assets impairment charges of 151 million related to stores in greater china the uk and ireland and impairment charges of 47 million related to stores in the us and canada for operating lease assets we recognized impairment charges of 65 million impairment charges of 61 million related to stores in greater china and the uk and impairment charges of 4 million related to stores in the us 

in total we recognized impairment charges of 263 million for longlived store assets which are included in costs of goods sold buying  occupancy in the 2019 consolidated statement of income loss impairment charges of 212 million related to store assets in greater china the uk and ireland were recorded within the victorias secret and bath  body works international segment impairment charges of 51 million related to store assets in the us and canada were recorded within the victorias secret segment 

in 2018 we recognized impairment charges of 101 million for leasehold improvements and store related assets impairment charges of 70 million related to stores in the us and canada were recorded within the victorias secret segment impairment charges of 31 million related to stores in the uk were recorded within the victorias secret and bath  body works international segment these charges are included in costs of goods sold buying  occupancy in the 2018 consolidated statement of income loss 

our fair value estimates incorporated significant assumptions and judgments including but not limited to estimated future cash flows discount rates and market rental rates the use of different assumptions or judgments in our assessment could materially increase or decrease the fair value of our store assets and accordingly could materially increase or decrease any related impairment charge a three percentage point reduction to our comparable sales assumptions a key input in determining estimated future cash flows would not have resulted in a material incremental impairment charge in 2019 further sustained declines in our business performance could result in a material impairment charge in a future period 

when a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life 

goodwill 

goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change we have the option to either first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that each reporting units fair value is less than its carrying value including goodwill or to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment which requires a comparison of the reporting units fair value to its carrying value including goodwill if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit our reporting units are determined in accordance with the provisions of asc 350 intangibles  goodwill and other as a result of goodwill impairment charges recognized in 2019 only the bath  body works reporting unit has goodwill as of february 1 2020 

as of the end of the third quarter of 2019 we performed a quantitative interim impairment assessment over the victorias secret and greater china reporting units an interim assessment was performed in consideration of the negative performance of these reporting units and their impact on the sustained decline in our market capitalization further for the greater china reporting unit we considered the results of the longlived store asset impairment assessment 

the interim assessment concluded that the fair value of the victorias secret reporting unit which was based on a weighted average of the income and market approaches exceeded its carrying value however the fair value of the greater china reporting unit which was based on the income approach did not exceed its carrying value accordingly we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 30 million in the third quarter of 2019 related to the greater china reporting unit this charge is included in impairment of goodwill in the 2019 consolidated statement of income loss 

as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2019 we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment over the bath  body works and victorias secret reporting units the fair value of the bath  body works reporting unit was estimated using a weighted average of the income and market approaches as a result of continued fourth quarter declines in business performance and increased risk volatility and uncertainty related to the victorias secret reporting unit we estimated its fair value using a market approach 

the annual assessment concluded that the fair value of the victorias secret reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value accordingly we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 690 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to the victorias secret reporting unit this charge is included in impairment of goodwill in the 2019 consolidated statement of income loss the annual assessment also concluded that the fair value of the bath  body works reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 

the market approach is based on earnings multiples of selected guideline public companies while the income approach is based on estimated discounted future cash flows the approaches which are determined using level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy incorporated a number of significant assumptions and judgments including but not limited to estimated future cash flows multiples of earnings of similar public companies discount rates income tax rates terminal growth rates and an implied control premium relative to our market capitalization 

the use of different assumptions or judgments in our goodwill impairment assessment including with respect to the estimated future cash flows the earnings multiples used in the market approach the discount rate used to discount such estimated future cash flows to their net present value and the reasonableness of the implied control premium relative to our market capitalization could materially increase or decrease the fair value of our reporting units and accordingly could materially increase or decrease any related impairment charge declines in our market capitalization or in our business performance could result in a material impairment charge in a future period 

intangible assets  indefinite lives 

intangible assets with indefinite lives represent the victoria’s secret and bath  body works trade names intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change we have the option to either first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired or to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment which requires a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value to determine if the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount we will estimate the fair value usually determined by the relief from royalty method under the income approach and compare that value with its carrying amount if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference 

as of the end of the third quarter of 2019 we performed a quantitative interim impairment assessment of the victorias secret trade name an interim assessment was performed in consideration of the negative performance of victorias secret to estimate the fair value of the victorias secret trade name we used the relief from royalty method under the income approach the interim assessment concluded that the fair value of the victorias secret trade name exceeded its carrying value 

as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2019 we performed our annual impairment assessment of the victorias secret and bath  body works trade names to estimate the fair value of the trade names we used the relief from royalty method under the income approach the annual assessment concluded that the fair values of the trade names were in excess of their respective carrying values 

the use of different assumptions or judgments in our impairment assessment of our trade names including with respect to the estimated future cash flows the discount rate used to discount such estimated future cash flows to their net present value and royalty rates used for the relief from royalty method could materially increase or decrease the fair value of our trade names a 50 reduction to our assumed royalty rate would not have resulted in a material incremental impairment charge in 2019 

claims and contingencies 

we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits taxes insurance regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business our determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the consolidated financial statements is based on management’s view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency we consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seek input from both internal and external experts with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business we accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible as opposed to probable or if an estimate is not reasonably determinable disclosure of a material claim or contingency is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our consolidated statement of income loss in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 

significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities in determining our provision for income taxes we consider permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates our effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings 

we follow the authoritative guidance included in asc 740 income taxes  which contains a twostep approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and for which actual outcomes may differ from forecasted outcomes our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 

our income tax returns like those of most companies are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified we adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

revenue recognition 

in the first quarter of 2018 we adopted asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers  using the modified retrospective approach 

we recognize revenue based on the amount we expect to receive when control of the goods or services is transferred to our customer we recognize sales upon customer receipt of merchandise which for direct channel revenues reflect an estimate of shipments that have not yet been received by our customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times our shipping and handling revenues are included in net sales with the related costs included in costs of goods sold buying and occupancy in our consolidated statements of income loss we also provide a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience net sales exclude sales and other similar taxes collected from customers 

we offer certain loyalty programs that allow customers to earn points based on purchasing activity as customers accumulate points and reach point thresholds they can use the points to purchase merchandise in stores or online we allocate revenue to points earned on qualifying purchases and defer recognition until the points are redeemed the amount of revenue deferred is based on the relative standalone selling price method which includes an estimate for points not expected to be redeemed based on historical experience 

we sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers we do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards we recognize revenue from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer in addition we recognize revenue on unredeemed gift cards where the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions gift card breakage gift card breakage revenue is recognized in proportion and over the same period as actual gift card redemptions we determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns gift card breakage is included in net sales in our consolidated statements of income loss 

revenue earned in connection with victoria’s secrets private label credit card arrangement is recognized over the term of the license arrangement and is included in net sales in our 2019 and 2018 consolidated statements of income loss 

we also recognize revenues associated with franchise license wholesale and sourcing arrangements revenue recognized under franchise and license arrangements generally consists of royalties earned and recognized upon sale of merchandise by franchise and license partners to retail customers revenue is generally recognized under wholesale and sourcing arrangements at the time the title passes to the partner 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates we may use derivative financial instruments like foreign currency forward contracts crosscurrency swaps and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

foreign exchange rate risk 

we have operations in foreign countries which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations our canadian dollar british pound chinese yuan hong kong dollar and euro denominated earnings are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all our merchandise sold in canada the uk ireland and greater china is sourced through us dollar transactions although we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset risks associated with our operations in canada and the uk these measures may not succeed in offsetting all the shortterm impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally may not be effective in offsetting the longterm impact of sustained shifts in foreign currency rates 

further although our royalty arrangements with our international partners are denominated in us dollars the royalties we receive in us dollars are calculated based on sales in the local currency as a result our royalties in these arrangements are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

interest rate risk 

our investment portfolio primarily consists of interestbearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which specifies permitted types of investments specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk typically our investment portfolio is comprised of us government obligations us treasury and aaarated money market funds commercial paper and bank deposits given the shortterm nature and quality of investments in our portfolio we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates 

excluding our foreign facilities all of our longterm debt as of february 1 2020 has fixed interest rates we will from time to time adjust our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap arrangements our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows 

fair value of financial instruments 

as of february 1 2020  we believe that the carrying values of accounts receivable accounts payable accrued expenses and current debt approximate fair value because of their short maturity 

the following table provides a summary of the principal value and estimated fair value of outstanding publicly traded debt and other financial instruments as of february 1 2020 and february 2 2019  

  



 

 concentration of credit risk 

we maintain cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions we monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity typically our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of us government obligations us treasury and aaarated money market funds commercial paper and bank deposits we also periodically review the relative credit standing of franchise license and wholesale partners and other entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business

 item 1a risk factors 

we caution that any forwardlooking statements as such term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 contained in this report or made by our company or our management involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors many of which are beyond our control accordingly our future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forwardlooking statements words such as “estimate” “project” “plan” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “planned” “potential” and any similar expressions may identify forwardlooking statements risks associated with the following factors among others in some cases have affected and in the future could affect our financial performance and actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forwardlooking statements included in this report or otherwise made by our company or our management 



 6 

 we are not under any obligation and do not intend to make publicly available any update or other revisions to any of the forwardlooking statements contained in this report to reflect circumstances existing after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of future events even if experience or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by those forwardlooking statements will not be realized 

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10k other filings or in any other discussions of our business the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and item 8  financial statements and supplementary data 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results the risks described below are not our only risks additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business operating results andor financial condition in a material way 

our net sales profit results and cash flows are sensitive to and may be affected by general economic conditions consumer confidence spending patterns weather or other market disruptions 

our net sales profit cash flows and future growth may be affected by negative local regional national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers’ ability or willingness to spend including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war terrorism or the threat thereof in addition market disruptions due to natural disasters health hazards or other major events or the prospect of these events could also impact consumer spending and confidence levels purchases of women’s intimate and other apparel beauty and personal care products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak in such circumstances we may increase the number of promotional sales which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the decision by the uk to leave the european union “brexit” has increased the uncertainty in the economic and political environment in europe the uk’s withdrawal is currently scheduled to take place in the first half of 2019 unless a further extension is agreed to however ongoing uncertainty remains as to what kind of postbrexit agreement between the uk and the european union if any may be approved by the uk parliament our business in the uk may be adversely impacted by this uncertainty fluctuations in currency exchange rates changes in trade policies or changes in labor immigration tax or other laws 

extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located particularly in markets where we have multiple stores could adversely affect our business for example heavy snowfall rainfall or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period might make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability 

our net sales operating income cash and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis 

we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 7 

seasonal fluctuations also affect our cash and inventory levels since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases we must carry a significant amount of inventory especially before the holiday season selling period if we are not successful in selling inventory we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space 

most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers sales at these stores are derived in part from the volume of traffic in those retail areas our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area including “destination” retail stores to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by factors that we cannot control such as economic downturns or changes in consumer demographics in a particular area consumer trends away from brickandmortar retail toward online shopping competition from internet and other retailers and other retail areas where we do not have stores the closing or decline in popularity of other stores in the shopping areas where our stores are located and the deterioration in the financial condition of the operators or developers of the shopping areas in which our stores are located 

part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs some of our store locations such as our victoria’s secret flagship stores require significant upfront capital investment and have material lease commitments additionally we are dependent upon the suitability of the lease spaces that we currently use the leases that we enter into are generally noncancelable leases with initial terms of 10 years if we determine that it is no longer economical to operate a store and decide to close it we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new stores into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our plans for international expansion include risks that could impact our results and reputation 

we intend to further expand into international markets including mainland china through partner arrangements andor companyowned stores the risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market any of these difficulties may lead to disruption in the overall timing of our international expansion efforts or increased costs further entry into other markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence other risks include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets volatility in the geopolitical landscape restrictions on the repatriation of funds held internationally disruptions or delays in shipments changes in diplomatic and trade relationships political instability and foreign governmental regulation such expansions will also have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance 

we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners in addition certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store openings and sales and their compliance with federal and local law we cannot ensure the profitability or success of our expansion into international markets 

  

further our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates see “fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations” below 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 8 

our licensees franchisees and wholesalers could take actions that could harm our business or brand images 

we have global representation through independently owned stores operated by our partners although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective partners the level of control we can exercise over our partners is limited and the quality and success of their operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control for example our partners may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel our brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our partners do not operate successfully these risks could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our direct channel businesses include risks that could have an effect on our results 

our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results risks include but are not limited to the difficulty in recreating the instore experience through our direct channels domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it outside our control our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in technology and logistics in order to appeal to existing and potential customers who increasingly rely on multiple channels to meet their shopping needs the failure of and risks related to the systems that operate our web infrastructure websites and the related support systems including computer viruses theft of customer information privacy concerns telecommunication failures and electronic breakins and similar disruptions 

our failure to maintain efficient and uninterrupted ordertaking and fulfillment operations could also have a material adverse effect on our results the satisfaction of our online customers depends on their timely receipt of merchandise if we encounter difficulties with the distribution facilities or if the facilities were to shut down for any reason including as a result of fire natural disaster or work stoppage we could face shortages of inventory incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers and cause customer dissatisfaction 

any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to protect our reputation could have a material effect on our brand images 

our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity any negative publicity including information publicized through traditional or social media platforms and similar venues such as blogs websites and other forums may affect our reputation and brand and consequently reduce demand for our merchandise even if such publicity is unverified or inaccurate 

failure to comply with ethical social product labor and environmental standards or related political considerations could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions including boycotts failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls to maintain the security of customer associate thirdparty or company information or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

if our marketing advertising and promotional programs are unsuccessful or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are our revenue or results of operations may be adversely affected 

customer traffic and demand for our merchandise are influenced by our advertising marketing and promotional activities the name recognition and reputation of our brands and the location of and service offered in our stores although we use marketing advertising and promotional programs to attract customers through various media including social media websites mobile applications email print and television some of our competitors may expend more for their programs than we do or use different approaches than we do which may provide them with a competitive advantage our programs may not be effective or could require increased expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations 

our ability to adequately protect our trade names trademarks and patents could have an impact on our brand images and ability to penetrate new markets 

we believe that our trade names trademarks and patents are important assets and an essential element of our strategy we have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names trademarks and patents and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries there can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others in particular the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if any thirdparty copies our products or our stores in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation it could have a 

 9 

material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could impact our results 

the sale of women’s intimate and other apparel personal care products and accessories is highly competitive we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers including individual and chain specialty stores department stores and discount retailers in addition to the traditional storebased retailers we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through online channels brand image marketing design price service assortment quality image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the storebased and online channels 

some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing and other resources available and trends across our product categories may favor our competitors we rely to a greater degree than some of our competitors on physical locations in shopping malls and centers and so declines in traffic to such locations may affect us more significantly than our competitors some of our competitors sell their products in stores that are located in the same shopping malls and centers as our stores in addition to competing for sales we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls and centers 

increased competition combined with declines in mall traffic could result in price reductions increased marketing expenditures and loss of pricing power and market share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to manage the life cycle of our brands and to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could impact the image and relevance of our brands 

our success depends in part on management’s ability to effectively manage the life cycle of our brands and to anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate salable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly if we are unable to successfully anticipate identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines our sales will be lower potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory in response we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by our ability to adequately source distribute and sell merchandise and other materials on a global basis 

we source merchandise and other materials directly in international markets and in our domestic market we distribute merchandise and other materials globally to our partners in international locations and to our stores many of our imports and exports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements including existing or potential duties tariffs or safeguard quotas we compete with other companies for production facilities 

we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business on a global basis for example 

 we also rely upon thirdparty transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments including shipments to and from our distribution centers to our stores and to our customers our utilization of these delivery services for shipments is subject to risks including increases in labor costs and fuel prices which would increase our shipping costs and associate strikes and inclement weather which may impact our transportation providers’ ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs 

 10 

our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we rely on a number of vendor and distribution facilities located in the same vicinity making our business susceptible to local and regional disruptions or adverse conditions 

to achieve the necessary speed and agility in producing our beauty personal care and home fragrance products we rely heavily on vendor and distribution facilities in close proximity to our headquarters in central ohio as a result of geographic concentration of the vendor and distribution facilities that we rely upon our operations are susceptible to local and regional factors such as accidents system failures economic and weather conditions natural disasters demographic and population changes and other unforeseen events and circumstances any significant interruption in the operations of these facilities could lead to inventory issues or increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales profits assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition our royalty arrangements are calculated based on sales in local currency and as such we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations although we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency risks these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the shortterm negative impacts of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations hedging would generally not be effective in offsetting the longterm impact of sustained shifts in foreign exchange rates on our business results as a result the fluctuation in the value of the us dollar against other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our stock price may be volatile 

our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry any guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe are reasonably attainable at the time guidance is given if or when we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us outside investment analysts or others our stock price could be adversely affected investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk 

in addition the stock market may experience price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance 

if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be harmed 

our dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future this ability may be subject to certain economic financial competitive and other factors that are beyond our control our board of directors may at its discretion decrease the level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time on november 19 2018 our board of directors announced that it planned to reduce our annual ordinary dividend to 120 per share from 240 per share beginning with the quarterly dividend paid in march 2019 any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation investor confidence in us and our stock price 

our ability to maintain our credit rating could affect our ability to access capital and could increase our interest expense 

the credit rating agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings a deterioration in our capital structure or the quality and stability of our earnings could result in a downgrade of our credit rating any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive if our ability to access capital becomes constrained our interest costs will likely increase which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows additionally changes to our credit rating could affect our future interest costs 

we may be impacted by our ability to service or refinance our debt 

we currently have substantial indebtedness some of our debt agreements contain covenants which require maintenance of certain financial ratios and also under certain conditions restrict our ability to pay dividends repurchase common shares and make other restricted payments as defined in those agreements our cash flow from operations provides the primary source of 

 11 

funds for our debt service payments if our cash flow from operations declines we may be unable to service or refinance our current debt 

shareholder activism could cause us to incur significant expense hinder execution of our business strategy and impact our stock price 

shareholder activism which can take many forms and arise in a variety of situations could result in substantial costs and divert management’s and our board’s attention and resources from our business additionally such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future adversely affect our relationships with our associates customers or service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel also we may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters including for thirdparty advisors our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events risks and uncertainties of any shareholder activism 

we may be impacted by our ability to recruit train and retain key personnel 

we believe we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives including leslie h wexner chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit train and retain other qualified key personnel 

we may be impacted by our ability to attract develop and retain qualified associates and manage laborrelated costs 

we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer which requires us to have highly trained and engaged associates our success depends in part upon our ability to attract develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified associates including store personnel and talented merchants the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas competition for such qualified individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand delayed store openings significant increases in associate turnover rates or significant increases in laborrelated costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by our vendors’ ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner meet quality standards and comply with applicable laws and regulations 

we purchase products from thirdparty vendors factors outside our control such as production or shipping delays or quality problems could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales cancellation charges or excessive markdowns 

in addition quality problems could result in a product liability judgment or a widespread product recall that may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability competition reaction and consumer attitudes even if the product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertions could adversely impact our reputation with existing and potential customers and our brand image 

our business could also suffer if our thirdparty vendors fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations while our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our associates visit and monitor the operations of our thirdparty vendors we do not control these vendors or their practices the violation of labor environmental or other laws by thirdparty vendors used by us or the divergence of a thirdparty vendor’s or partner’s labor or environmental practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results may be affected by fluctuations in product input costs 

product input costs including freight labor and raw materials fluctuate these fluctuations may result in an increase in our production costs we may not be able to or may elect not to pass these increases on to our customers which may adversely impact our profit margins these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 12 

our ability to adequately protect our assets from loss and theft 

our assets are subject to loss including those caused by illegal or unethical conduct by associates customers vendors or unaffiliated third parties we have experienced events such as inventory shrinkage in the past and we cannot assure that incidences of loss and theft will decrease in the future or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce these losses higher rates of loss or increased security costs to combat theft could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results may be affected by fluctuations in energy costs 

energy costs have fluctuated in the past these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase products from our manufacturers a continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by increases in costs of mailing paper and printing 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and promotional mailings we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to recover these costs or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing mailing delivery and order fulfillment systems these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we selfinsure certain risks and may be impacted by unfavorable claims experience 

we are selfinsured for various types of insurable risks including associate medical benefits workers’ compensation property general liability and automobile up to certain stoploss limits claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile any adverse claims experience could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

retained or contingent liabilities from businesses that we divest could adversely affect our financial results 

in the fourth quarter of 2018 we completed the sale of la senza to an affiliate of regent lp a global private equity firm as a result of this divestiture we may incur unexpected contingent liabilities including with respect to leases assumed by the buyer our divestiture activities may also present financial and operational risks those risks may include difficulties separating personnel financial and other systems and indemnities and potential disputes with the buyer of la senza any of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems and to protect associated data 

our success depends in part on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems our information technology systems as well as those of our service providers are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources including telecommunication failures malicious human acts and natural disasters moreover despite network security measures some of our servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses and similar disruptive problems additionally these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer merchandise financial or other important information which could result in damage to our reputation andor litigation the increased use of smartphones tablets and other mobile devices may also heighten these and other operational risks despite the precautions we have taken unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems sustained or repeated system disruptions that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores impact our consumers’ ability to access our websites in a timely manner or expose confidential customer information merchandise financial or other important information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition from time to time we make modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for pointofsale ecommerce merchandising planning sourcing logistics inventory management and support systems including human resources and finance modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems including not accurately capturing data and system disruptions information technology system disruptions if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition and cash flows 

 13 

our ability to maintain the security of customer associate thirdparty or company information could have an impact on our reputation and our results 

information systems are susceptible to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks any significant compromise or breach of our data security could significantly damage our reputation with our customers associates investors and other third parties cause the disclosure of confidential customer associate thirdparty or company information cause our customers to stop shopping with us and result in significant legal regulatory and financial liabilities and lost revenues while we train our associates and have implemented systems and processes to protect against unauthorized access to our information systems and prevent data loss there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches in addition to our own networks and databases we use thirdparty service providers to store process and transmit certain of this information on our behalf although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in their systems we have confidential security measures in place to protect our physical facilities and information technology systems from attacks despite these measures we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches phishing attacks denial of service attacks acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or similar events 

the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs such as costs related to organizational changes implementing additional protection technologies training associates and engaging consultants additionally we could incur lost revenues and face increased litigation as a result of any potential cybersecurity breach 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by our ability to comply with regulatory requirements 

we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements our policies procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable foreign and domestic laws and regulations including those required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act the sec and the new york stock exchange the “nyse” among others although we have put in place policies and procedures aimed at ensuring legal and regulatory compliance our associates subcontractors vendors licensees franchisees and other third parties could take actions that violate these laws and regulations any violations of such laws or regulations could have an adverse effect on our reputation market price of our common stock results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

it can be difficult to comply with sometimes conflicting regulations in local national or foreign jurisdictions as well as new or changing regulations also changes in such laws could make operating our business more expensive or require us to change the way we do business for example changes in product safety or other consumer protection laws could lead to increased costs for certain merchandise or additional labor costs associated with readying merchandise for sale it may be difficult for us to oversee regulatory changes impacting our business and our responses to changes in the law could be costly and may negatively impact our operations 

we may be adversely impacted by certain compliance or legal matters 

we along with third parties we do business with are subject to complex compliance and litigation risks actions filed against us from time to time include commercial tort intellectual property customer employment wage and hour data privacy securities anticorruption and other claims including purported class action lawsuits the cost of defending against these types of claims against us or the ultimate resolution of such claims whether by settlement or adverse court decision may harm our business further potential claimants may be encouraged to bring suits based on a settlement from us or adverse court decisions against us we cannot currently assess the likely outcome of such suits but if the outcome were negative it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition we may be impacted by litigation trends including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation the market price of our common stock results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by changes in taxation trade and other regulatory requirements 

we are subject to income tax in local national and international jurisdictions in addition our products are subject to import and excise duties andor sales or valueadded taxes in many jurisdictions we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies we regularly 

 14 

assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations fluctuations in tax rates and duties changes in tax legislation or regulation or adverse outcomes of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

there is increased uncertainty with respect to tax policy and trade relations between the us and other countries major developments in tax policy or trade relations such as the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

revenue from contracts with customers 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers  which was further clarified and amended in 2015 and 2016 this guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the new standard also results in enhanced disclosures about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers 

we adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2018 under the modified retrospective approach under the standard income from the victorias secret private label credit card arrangement which was historically presented as a reduction to general administrative and store operating expenses is presented as revenue further historical accounting related to loyalty points earned under the victorias secret customer loyalty program changed as we now defer revenue associated with customer loyalty points until the points are redeemed using a relative standalone selling price method the standard also changed accounting for sales returns which requires balance sheet presentation on a gross basis 

in the first quarter of 2018 we recorded a cumulative catchup adjustment resulting in a reduction to opening retained earnings net of tax of 28 million  the cumulative adjustment primarily related to the deferral of revenue related to outstanding points net of estimated forfeitures under the victorias secret customer loyalty program in addition net sales and general administrative and store operating expenses both increased 187 million in the 2018 consolidated statement of income further gross presentation of our sales return reserve resulted in a 5 million increase in other current assets and accrued expenses and other on the february 2 2019 consolidated balance sheet 

fair value of financial instruments 

in january 2016 the fasb issued asc 321 investments  equity securities  which addresses certain aspects of the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments the standard requires the recognition of changes in the fair value of marketable equity securities in net income as compared to historical treatment in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet we adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2018 and recorded an increase to opening retained earnings net of tax of 2 million  

leases 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asc 842 leases  which is effective beginning in fiscal 2019 and requires companies classified as lessees to account for most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to today’s accounting the standard also will result in enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures including significant judgments made by management to provide greater insight into the extent of revenue and expense recognized and expected to be recognized from existing leases in july 2018 the fasb approved an amendment to the standard that provides companies a transition option that would not require earlier periods to be restated upon adoption 

 46 

we will adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2019 and apply the standard prospectively as of the adoption date as allowed by the new standard we elected the package of transition practical expedients but have elected to not apply the hindsight practical expedient to our leases at transition 

substantially all of our leases including our retail store locations are subject to operating lease accounting under the new standard we expect to recognize rightofuse assets of approximately 33 billion  and related lease liabilities of approximately 37 billion  on our consolidated balance sheet upon adoption at the beginning of fiscal 2019 these balances will change as our lease portfolio changes due to execution of lease modifications or new leases the rightofuse assets are based upon the lease liabilities adjusted for deferred rent liabilities and unamortized landlord construction allowances we will continue to recognize rent expense in the consolidated statements of income on a straightline basis over the lease term 

hedging activities 

in august 2017 the fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201712 targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities  which is intended to better align risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships the standard eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item it also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements we will adopt the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

goodwill 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201704 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment  which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill the standard eliminates the second step from the goodwill impairment test which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation to determine the implied fair value of goodwill under the new standard the goodwill impairment charge will be the excess of the reporting units carrying value over its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit this guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal 2020 with early adoption permitted we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

impact of inflation 

while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required we believe the effects of inflation if any on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements on an ongoing basis management evaluates its accounting policies estimates and judgments including those related to inventories longlived assets claims and contingencies income taxes and revenue recognition management bases our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position 

inventories 

inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a weightedaverage cost basis 

we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of inventory on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

we also record inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory these estimates are based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends 

management believes that the assumptions used in these estimates are reasonable and appropriate a 10 increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 5 million  for 2018  a 10 increase 

 47 

or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 5 million  for 2018  

valuation of longlived assets 

property and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable assets are grouped at the lowest level for which they are largely independent of other assets or asset groups if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset or asset group are less than the carrying value we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group when a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life 

goodwill is reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change we have the option to either first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that each reporting units fair value is less than its carrying value including goodwill or to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment which requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting units fair value to its carrying value including goodwill if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we then estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities of that reporting unit including the implied fair value of goodwill through either estimated discounted future cash flows or marketbased methodologies if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference our reporting units are determined in accordance with the provisions of asc 350 intangibles  goodwill and other  our reporting units that have goodwill are victorias secret bath  body works and greater china 

intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change we have the option to either first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired or to proceed directly to the quantitative assessment which requires a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value to determine if the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount we will estimate the fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset and compare that value with its carrying amount if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference 

we estimate the fair value of property and equipment goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of asc 820 fair value measurement  if future economic conditions are different than those projected by management future impairment charges may be required 

claims and contingencies 

we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits insurance regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business our determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the consolidated financial statements is based on management’s view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency we consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seek input from both internal and external experts with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business we accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible as opposed to probable or if an estimate is not reasonably determinable disclosure of a material claim or contingency is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our consolidated statement of income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 

significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities in determining our provision for income taxes we consider permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates our effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings 

 48 

we follow the authoritative guidance included in asc 740 income taxes  which contains a twostep approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and for which actual outcomes may differ from forecasted outcomes our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 

our income tax returns like those of most companies are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified we adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

revenue recognition 

in the first quarter of 2018 we adopted asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers  using the modified retrospective approach 

we recognize revenue based on the amount we expect to receive when control of the goods or services is transferred to our customer we recognize sales upon customer receipt of merchandise which for direct channel revenues reflect an estimate of shipments that have not yet been received by our customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times our shipping and handling revenues are included in net sales with the related costs included in costs of goods sold buying and occupancy in our consolidated statements of income we also provide a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience net sales exclude sales and other similar taxes collected from customers 

we offer certain loyalty programs that allow customers to earn points based on purchasing activity as customers accumulate points and reach point thresholds they can use the points to purchase merchandise in stores or online we allocate revenue to points earned on qualifying purchases and defer recognition until the points are redeemed the amount of revenue deferred is based on the relative standalone selling price method which includes an estimate for points not expected to be redeemed based on historical experience 

we sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers we do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards we recognize revenue from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer in addition we recognize revenue on unredeemed gift cards where the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions gift card breakage gift card breakage revenue is recognized in proportion and over the same period as actual gift card redemptions we determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns gift card breakage is included in net sales in our consolidated statements of income 

revenue earned in connection with victoria’s secrets private label credit card arrangement is recognized over the term of the license arrangement and is included in net sales in our 2018 consolidated statement of income 

we also recognize revenues associated with franchise license wholesale and sourcing arrangements revenue recognized under franchise and license arrangements generally consists of royalties earned and recognized upon sale of merchandise by franchise and license partners to retail customers revenue is generally recognized under wholesale and sourcing arrangements at the time the title passes to the partner 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates we may use derivative financial instruments like foreign currency forward contracts crosscurrency swaps and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

foreign exchange rate risk 

we have operations in foreign countries which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations our canadian dollar british pound chinese yuan hong kong dollar and euro denominated earnings are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all our merchandise sold in canada the uk ireland and greater china is sourced 

 49 

through us dollar transactions although we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset risks associated with canadian dollar and british pound denominated earnings these measures may not succeed in offsetting all the shortterm impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally may not be effective in offsetting the longterm impact of sustained shifts in foreign currency rates 

further although our royalty arrangements with our international partners are denominated in us dollars the royalties we receive in us dollars are calculated based on sales in the local currency as a result our royalties in these arrangements are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

interest rate risk 

our investment portfolio primarily consists of interestbearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which specifies permitted types of investments specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk typically our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of us government obligations us treasury and aaarated money market funds commercial paper and bank deposits given the shortterm nature and quality of investments in our portfolio we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates 

excluding our foreign facilities all of our longterm debt as of february 2 2019  has fixed interest rates we will from time to time adjust our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap arrangements our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows 

fair value of financial instruments 

the following table provides a summary of the principal value and estimated fair value of outstanding publicly traded debt as of february 2 2019  and february 3 2018

concentration of credit risk 

we maintain cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions we monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity typically our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of us government obligations us treasury and aaarated money market funds commercial paper and bank deposits we also periodically review the relative credit standing of franchise license and wholesale partners and other entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business

 item 1a risk factors 

we caution that any forwardlooking statements as such term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 contained in this report or made by our company or our management involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors many of which are beyond our control accordingly our future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forwardlooking statements words such as “estimate” “project” “plan” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “planned” “potential” and any similar expressions may identify forwardlooking statements risks associated with the following factors among others in some cases have affected and in the future could affect our financial performance and actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forwardlooking statements included in this report or otherwise made by our company or our management 



 6 

 we are not under any obligation and do not intend to make publicly available any update or other revisions to any of the forwardlooking statements contained in this report to reflect circumstances existing after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of future events even if experience or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by those forwardlooking statements will not be realized 

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10k other filings or in any other discussions of our business the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and item 8  financial statements and supplementary data 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results the risks described below are not our only risks additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business operating results andor financial condition in a material way 

our net sales profit results and cash flows are sensitive to and may be affected by general economic conditions consumer confidence spending patterns weather or other market disruptions 

our net sales profit cash flows and future growth may be affected by negative local regional national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers’ ability or willingness to spend including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war terrorism or the threat thereof in addition market disruptions due to severe weather conditions natural disasters health hazards or other major events or the prospect of these events could also impact consumer spending and confidence levels purchases of women’s intimate and other apparel beauty and personal care products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak in such circumstances we may increase the number of promotional sales which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the decision by the uk to leave the european union “brexit” has increased the uncertainty in the economic and political environment in europe in particular our business in the uk may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates changes in trade policies or changes in labor immigration tax or other laws 

extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located particularly in markets where we have multiple stores could adversely affect our business for example heavy snowfall rainfall or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period might make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability 

our net sales operating income cash and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis 

we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

seasonal fluctuations also affect our cash and inventory levels since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases we must carry a significant amount of inventory especially before the holiday season selling period if we are not successful in selling inventory we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 7 

our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space 

most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers sales at these stores are derived in part from the volume of traffic in those retail areas our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area including “destination” retail stores to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by factors that we cannot control such as economic downturns or changes in consumer demographics in a particular area consumer trends away from brickandmortar retail toward online shopping competition from internet and other retailers and other retail areas where we do not have stores the closing or decline in popularity of other stores in the shopping areas where our stores are located and the deterioration in the financial condition of the operators of the shopping areas or developers in which our stores are located 

part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs some of our store locations such as our victoria’s secret flagship stores require significant upfront capital investment and have material lease commitments additionally we are dependent upon the suitability of the lease spaces that we currently use the leases that we enter into are generally noncancellable leases with initial terms of ten years if we determine that it is no longer economical to operate a store and decide to close it we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new stores into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our plans for international expansion include risks that could impact our results and reputation 

we intend to further expand into international markets including mainland china through partner arrangements andor companyowned stores the risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market further entry into other markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence other risks include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets volatility in the geopolitical landscape restrictions on the repatriation of funds held internationally disruptions or delays in shipments changes in diplomatic and trade relationships political instability and foreign governmental regulation such expansions will also have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance 

we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners in addition certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store openings and sales and their compliance with federal and local law we cannot ensure the profitability or success of our expansion into international markets 

  

further our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates see “fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations” below 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our licensees franchisees and wholesalers could take actions that could harm our business or brand images 

we have global representation through independently owned stores operated by our partners although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective partners the level of control we can exercise over our partners is limited and the quality and success of their operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control for example our partners may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel our brand image and reputation may suffer 

 8 

materially and our sales could decline if our partners do not operate successfully these risks could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our direct channel businesses include risks that could have an effect on our results 

our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results risks include but are not limited to the difficulty in recreating the instore experience through our direct channels domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it outside our control our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in technology and logistics in order to appeal to existing and potential customers who increasingly rely on multiple channels to meet their shopping needs the failure of and risks related to the systems that operate our web infrastructure websites and the related support systems including computer viruses theft of customer information privacy concerns telecommunication failures and electronic breakins and similar disruptions and risks related to the fulfillment of directtoconsumer orders such as not adequately predicting customer demand 

our failure to maintain efficient and uninterrupted ordertaking and fulfillment operations could also have a material adverse effect on our results the satisfaction of our online customers depends on their timely receipt of merchandise if we encounter difficulties with the distribution facilities or if the facilities were to shut down for any reason including as a result of fire natural disaster or work stoppage we could face shortages of inventory incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers and cause customer dissatisfaction 

any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to protect our reputation could have a material effect on our brand images 

our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity any negative publicity including information publicized through traditional or social media platforms and similar venues such as blogs websites and other forums may affect our reputation and brand and consequently reduce demand for our merchandise even if such publicity is unverified or inaccurate 

failure to comply with ethical social product labor and environmental standards or related political considerations could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions including boycotts failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls to maintain the security of customer associate thirdparty or company information or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

if our marketing advertising and promotional programs are unsuccessful or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are our revenue or results of operations may be adversely affected 

customer traffic and demand for our merchandise are influenced by our advertising marketing and promotional activities the name recognition and reputation of our brands and the location of and service offered in our stores although we use marketing advertising and promotional programs to attract customers through various media including social media websites mobile applications email print and television some of our competitors may expend more for their programs than we do or use different approaches than we do which may provide them with a competitive advantage our programs may not be effective or could require increased expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations 

our ability to adequately protect our trade names trademarks and patents could have an impact on our brand images and ability to penetrate new markets 

we believe that our trade names trademarks and patents are important assets and an essential element of our strategy we have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names trademarks and patents and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries there can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others in particular the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if any thirdparty copies our products or our stores in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation it could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 9 

our ability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could impact our results 

the sale of women’s intimate and other apparel personal care products and accessories is highly competitive we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers including individual and chain specialty stores department stores and discount retailers in addition to the traditional storebased retailers we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through online channels brand image marketing design price service assortment quality image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the storebased and online channels 

some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing and other resources available in many cases our competitors sell their products in stores that are located in the same shopping malls and centers as our stores in addition to competing for sales we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls and centers 

increased competition could result in price reductions increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to manage the life cycle of our brands and to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could impact the image and relevance of our brands 

our success depends in part on management’s ability to effectively manage the life cycle of our brands and to anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate saleable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly if we are unable to successfully anticipate identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines our sales will be lower potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory in response we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by our ability to adequately source distribute and sell merchandise and other materials on a global basis 

we source merchandise and other materials directly in international markets and in our domestic market we distribute merchandise and other materials globally to our partners in international locations and to our stores many of our imports and exports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements including existing or potential duties tariffs or safeguard quotas we compete with other companies for production facilities 

we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business on a global basis for example 

 we also rely upon thirdparty transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments including shipments to and from our distribution centers to our stores and to our customers our utilization of these delivery services for shipments is subject to risks including increases in fuel prices which would increase our shipping costs and associate strikes and inclement weather which may impact our transportation providers’ ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs 

our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 10 

we rely on a number of vendor and distribution facilities located in the same vicinity making our business susceptible to local and regional disruptions or adverse conditions 

to achieve the necessary speed and agility in producing our beauty personal care and home fragrance products we rely heavily on vendor and distribution facilities in close proximity to our headquarters in central ohio as a result of geographic concentration of the vendor and distribution facilities that we rely upon our operations are susceptible to local and regional factors such as accidents system failures economic and weather conditions natural disasters demographic and population changes and other unforeseen events and circumstances any significant interruption in the operations of these facilities could lead to inventory issues or increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales profits assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition our royalty arrangements are calculated based on sales in local currency and as such we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations although we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency risks these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the shortterm negative impacts of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations hedging would generally not be effective in offsetting the longterm impact of sustained shifts in foreign exchange rates on our business results as a result the fluctuation in the value of the us dollar against other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our stock price may be volatile 

our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry any guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe are reasonably attainable at the time guidance is given if or when we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us outside investment analysts or others our stock price could be adversely affected investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk 

in addition the stock market may experience price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance 

if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be harmed 

our dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future this ability may be subject to certain economic financial competitive and other factors that are beyond our control our board of directors may at its discretion decrease the level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation investor confidence in us and our stock price 

our ability to maintain our credit rating could affect our ability to access capital and could increase our interest expense 

the credit rating agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings a deterioration in our capital structure or the quality and stability of our earnings could result in a downgrade of our credit rating any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive if our ability to access capital becomes constrained our interest costs will likely increase which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows additionally changes to our credit rating could affect our future interest costs 

we may be impacted by our ability to service or refinance our debt 

we currently have substantial indebtedness some of our debt agreements contain covenants which require maintenance of certain financial ratios and also under certain conditions restrict our ability to pay dividends repurchase common shares and make other restricted payments as defined in those agreements our cash flow from operations provides the primary source of funds for our debt service payments if our cash flow from operations declines we may be unable to service or refinance our current debt 

 11 

we may be impacted by our ability to recruit train and retain key personnel 

we believe we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives including leslie h wexner chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit train and retain other qualified key personnel 

we may be impacted by our ability to attract develop and retain qualified associates and manage laborrelated costs 

we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer which requires us to have highly trained and engaged associates our success depends in part upon our ability to attract develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified associates including store personnel and talented merchants the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas competition for such qualified individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand delayed store openings significant increases in associate turnover rates or significant increases in laborrelated costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by our vendors’ ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner meet quality standards and comply with applicable laws and regulations 

we purchase products from thirdparty vendors factors outside our control such as production or shipping delays or quality problems could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales cancellation charges or excessive markdowns 

in addition quality problems could result in a product liability judgment or a widespread product recall that may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability competition reaction and consumer attitudes even if the product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertions could adversely impact our reputation with existing and potential customers and our brand image 

our business could also suffer if our thirdparty vendors fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations while our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our associates visit and monitor the operations of our thirdparty vendors we do not control these vendors or their practices the violation of labor environmental or other laws by thirdparty vendors used by us or the divergence of a thirdparty vendor’s or partner’s labor or environmental practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results may be affected by fluctuations in product input costs 

product input costs including freight labor and raw materials fluctuate these fluctuations may result in an increase in our production costs we may not be able to or may elect not to pass these increases on to our customers which may adversely impact our profit margins these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to adequately protect our assets from loss and theft 

our assets are subject to loss including those caused by illegal or unethical conduct by associates customers vendors or unaffiliated third parties we have experienced events such as inventory shrinkage in the past and we cannot assure that incidences of loss and theft will decrease in the future or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce these losses higher rates of loss or increased security costs to combat theft could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results may be affected by fluctuations in energy costs 

energy costs have fluctuated in the past these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase products from our manufacturers a continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 12 

we may be impacted by increases in costs of mailing paper and printing 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and promotional mailings we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to recover these costs or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing mailing delivery and order fulfillment systems these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we selfinsure certain risks and may be impacted by unfavorable claims experience 

we are selfinsured for various types of insurable risks including associate medical benefits workers’ compensation property general liability and automobile up to certain stoploss limits claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile any adverse claims experience could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems and to protect associated data 

our success depends in part on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems our information technology systems as well as those of our service providers are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources including telecommunication failures malicious human acts and natural disasters moreover despite network security measures some of our servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses and similar disruptive problems additionally these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer merchandise financial or other important information which could result in damage to our reputation andor litigation the increased use of smartphones tablets and other mobile devices may also heighten these and other operational risks despite the precautions we have taken unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems sustained or repeated system disruptions that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores impact our consumers’ ability to access our websites in a timely manner or expose confidential customer information merchandise financial or other important information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition from time to time we make modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for pointofsale ecommerce merchandising planning sourcing logistics inventory management and support systems including human resources and finance modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems including not accurately capturing data and system disruptions information technology system disruptions if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to maintain the security of customer associate thirdparty or company information could have an impact on our reputation and our results 

information systems are susceptible to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks any significant compromise or breach of our data security could significantly damage our reputation with our customers associates investors and other third parties cause the disclosure of confidential customer associate thirdparty or company information cause our customers to stop shopping with us and result in significant legal regulatory and financial liabilities and lost revenues while we train our associates and have implemented systems and processes to protect against unauthorized access to our information systems and prevent data loss there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches in addition to our own networks and databases we use thirdparty service providers to store process and transmit certain of this information on our behalf although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in their systems we have confidential security measures in place to protect our physical facilities and information technology systems from attacks despite these measures we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches phishing attacks denial of service attacks acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or similar events 

the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs such as costs related to organizational changes implementing additional protection technologies training associates and engaging consultants additionally we could incur lost revenues and face increased litigation as a result of any potential cybersecurity breach 

 13 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by our ability to comply with regulatory requirements 

we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements our policies procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable foreign and domestic laws and regulations including those required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act the sec and the new york stock exchange the “nyse” among others although we have put in place policies and procedures aimed at ensuring legal and regulatory compliance our associates subcontractors vendors licensees franchisees and other third parties could take actions that violate these laws and regulations any violations of such laws or regulations could have an adverse effect on our reputation market price of our common stock results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

it can be difficult to comply with sometimes conflicting regulations in local national or foreign jurisdictions as well as new or changing regulations also changes in such laws could make operating our business more expensive or require us to change the way we do business for example changes in product safety or other consumer protection laws could lead to increased costs for certain merchandise or additional labor costs associated with readying merchandise for sale it may be difficult for us to oversee regulatory changes impacting our business and our responses to changes in the law could be costly and may negatively impact our operations 

we may be adversely impacted by certain compliance or legal matters 

we along with third parties we do business with are subject to complex compliance and litigation risks actions filed against us from time to time include commercial tort intellectual property customer employment wage and hour data privacy securities anticorruption and other claims including purported class action lawsuits the cost of defending against these types of claims against us or the ultimate resolution of such claims whether by settlement or adverse court decision may harm our business further potential claimants may be encouraged to bring suits based on a settlement from us or adverse court decisions against us we cannot currently assess the likely outcome of such suits but if the outcome were negative it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition we may be impacted by litigation trends including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation the market price of our common stock results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by changes in taxation trade and other regulatory requirements 

we are subject to income tax in local national and international jurisdictions in addition our products are subject to import and excise duties andor sales or valueadded taxes in many jurisdictions we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations fluctuations in tax rates and duties changes in tax legislation or regulation or adverse outcomes of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

there is increased uncertainty with respect to tax policy and trade relations between the us and other countries major developments in tax policy or trade relations such as the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

in addition the amendment reduced the commitment fees payable under the revolving facility which are based on our longterm credit rating to 025  per annum the amendment did not modify our quantitative covenant requirements but did provide an increased limit on restricted payments in the event we do not meet the criteria to make these payments without limitation and provides greater flexibility with respect to our ability to grant liens on assets

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

sharebased compensation 

in the first quarter of 2017 we adopted asu no 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  on a prospective basis this standard requires recognition of the income tax effects of sharebased awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are exercised these effects were historically recorded in equity on the balance sheet as a result we recognized 13 million  of excess tax benefits related to sharebased awards in provision for income taxes in the 2017 consolidated statement of income the standard also requires all taxrelated cash flows from sharebased awards to be reported as operating activities on the statements of cash flows and any cash payments made to taxing authorities on an employees behalf from withheld shares as financing activities the retrospective application of these changes resulted in a 100 million  increase in operating cash flows and a corresponding decrease to financing cash flows on the 2016 consolidated statement of cash flows and a 158 million  increase in operating cash flows and a corresponding decrease to financing cash flows on the 2015 consolidated statement of cash flows further as allowed by the standard we will continue to estimate award forfeitures at the time awards are granted and adjust if necessary in subsequent periods based on historical experience and expected future forfeiture rates 

revenue from contracts with customers 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers  which was further clarified and amended in 2015 and 2016 this guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the new standard also will result in enhanced disclosures about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers this guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal 2018 the standard allows for either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective transition method 

we will adopt the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 under the modified retrospective approach under the new standard income from the victorias secret private label credit card arrangement which has historically been presented as a reduction to general administrative and store operating expenses will be presented as revenue further our current accounting related to loyalty points earned under the victorias secret customer loyalty program will change as we will begin to defer revenue associated with customer loyalty points until the points are redeemed using a relative standalone selling price method the new standard will also change our accounting for sales returns which requires balance sheet presentation on a gross basis 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 we will record a cumulative catchup adjustment resulting in a reduction to opening retained earnings net of tax of approximately 28 million primarily relating to the deferral of revenue related to outstanding points net of estimated forfeitures under the victorias secret customer loyalty program in addition we expect the adoption of this standard to increase net sales and general administrative and store operating expenses by approximately 110 million  in fiscal 2018 as a result of the classification change for our victorias secret private label credit card arrangement 

fair value of financial instruments 

in january 2016 the fasb issued asu 201601 financial instruments — overall recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities  which addresses certain aspects of the recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments the standard requires the recognition of changes in the fair value of marketable equity securities in net income as compared to todays treatment in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet we will adopt the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and record an increase to opening retained earnings net of tax of 2 million  

leases 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asc 842 leases  which requires companies classified as lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to today’s accounting the new standard also will result in enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures including significant judgments made by management to provide greater insight into the extent of revenue and expense recognized and expected to be recognized from existing leases the standard currently requires a modified retrospective transition approach in january 2018 the fasb issued an exposure draft that would provide companies an option that would not require earlier periods to be restated upon adoption the standard is effective beginning in fiscal 2019 with early adoption permitted 

we are currently evaluating the impacts that this standard will have on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income balance sheets and statements of cash flows we currently expect that most of our operating lease commitments will be recognized as operating lease liabilities and rightofuse assets upon adoption of the standard thus we expect adoption will result in a material increase to the assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet we will adopt the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 

 47 

hedging activities 

in august 2017 the fasb issued asu 201712 targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities  which is intended to better align risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships the new standard eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness and generally requires the entire change in the fair value of a hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the hedged item it also eases certain documentation and assessment requirements this guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal 2019 with early adoption permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income balance sheets and statements of cash flows 

impact of inflation 

while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required we believe the effects of inflation if any on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements on an ongoing basis management evaluates its accounting policies estimates and judgments including those related to inventories longlived assets claims and contingencies income taxes and revenue recognition management bases our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position 

inventories 

inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a weightedaverage cost basis 

we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of inventory on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

we also record inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory these estimates are based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends 

management believes that the assumptions used in these estimates are reasonable and appropriate a 10 increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 4 million  for 2017  a 10 increase or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 5 million  for 2017  

valuation of longlived assets 

property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable assets are grouped at the lowest level for which they are largely independent of other assets or asset groups if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset or asset group are less than the carrying value we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset or asset group when a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life 

goodwill is reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change first we perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that each reporting units fair value is less than its carrying value including goodwill if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value we then estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities of that reporting unit including the implied fair value of goodwill through either estimated discounted future cash flows or marketbased methodologies if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value we recognize an impairment 

 48 

charge equal to the difference our reporting units are determined in accordance with the provisions of asc topic 350 intangibles  goodwill and other  our reporting units that have goodwill are victorias secret stores victorias secret direct bath  body works stores and greater china 

intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount we will estimate the fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset compare that value with its carrying amount and record an impairment charge if any 

we estimate the fair value of property and equipment goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of asc topic 820 fair value measurement  if future economic conditions are different than those projected by management future impairment charges may be required 

claims and contingencies 

we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits insurance regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business our determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the consolidated financial statements is based on management’s view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency we consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seek input from both internal and external experts with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business we accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible as opposed to probable or if an estimate is not reasonably determinable disclosure of a material claim or contingency is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our consolidated statement of income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized us deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed income of foreign subsidiaries where such earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested for the foreseeable future 

significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities in determining our provision for income taxes we consider permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates our effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings 

we follow the authoritative guidance included in asc topic 740 income taxes  which contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and for which actual outcomes may differ from forecasted outcomes our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 

our income tax returns like those of most companies are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified we adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

 49 

revenue recognition 

companyowned stores and direct channels 

while our recognition of revenue does not involve significant judgment revenue recognition represents an important accounting policy for our organization we recognize revenue upon customer receipt of the merchandise we also provide a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on historical experience for direct channel revenues we estimate shipments that have not been received by the customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times 

all of our brands sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers in retail stores through our direct channels and through third parties we do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards we recognize revenue from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer in addition we recognize revenue on unredeemed gift cards where the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions gift card breakage gift card breakage revenue is recognized in proportion and over the same time period as actual gift card redemptions we determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns gift card breakage is included in net sales in our consolidated statements of income 

royalty and other 

we also recognize revenues associated with franchise license and wholesale arrangements revenue recognized under franchise and license arrangements generally consists of royalties earned and recognized upon sale of merchandise by franchise and license partners to retail customers revenue is generally recognized under wholesale and sourcing arrangements at the time the title passes to the partner 

asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers 

for additional information regarding future impacts as a result of our adoption of asc 606 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 refer to recently issued accounting pronouncements in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates we may use derivative financial instruments like crosscurrency swaps foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

foreign exchange rate risk 

we have operations in foreign countries which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations our canadian dollar british pound chinese yuan hong kong dollar and euro denominated earnings are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all of our merchandise sold in canada the uk ireland and greater china is sourced through us dollar transactions although we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset risks associated with canadian dollar and british pound denominated earnings these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the shortterm impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally may not be effective in offsetting the longterm impact of sustained shifts in foreign currency rates 

further although our royalty arrangements with our international partners are denominated in us dollars the royalties we receive in us dollars are calculated based on sales in the local currency as a result our royalties in these arrangements are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

interest rate risk 

our investment portfolio primarily consists of interestbearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which specifies permitted types of investments specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer the primary objective of our investment activities are the preservation of principal the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk typically our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of us government obligations us treasury and aaarated money market funds commercial paper and bank deposits given the shortterm nature and quality of investments in our portfolio we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates 

 50 

all of our longterm debt as of february 3 2018  has fixed interest rates we will from time to time adjust our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap arrangements our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows 

fair value of financial instruments 

as of february 3 2018  we believe that the carrying values of accounts receivable accounts payable accrued expenses and current debt approximate fair value because of their short maturity 

the following table provides a summary of the principal value and fair value of longterm debt excluding foreign borrowings and swap arrangements as of february 3 2018  and january 28 2017  

  



 

 concentration of credit risk 

we maintain cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions we monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity typically our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of us government obligations us treasury and aaarated money market funds commercial paper and bank deposits we also periodically review the relative credit standing of franchise license and wholesale partners and other entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business

 item 1a risk factors 

we caution that any forwardlooking statements as such term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 contained in this report or made by our company or our management involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors many of which are beyond our control accordingly our future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forwardlooking statements words such as “estimate” “project” “plan” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “planned” “potential” and any similar expressions may identify forwardlooking statements risks associated with the following factors among others in some cases have affected and in the future could affect our financial performance and actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forwardlooking statements included in this report or otherwise made by our company or our management 



 6 

 we are not under any obligation and do not intend to make publicly available any update or other revisions to any of the forwardlooking statements contained in this report to reflect circumstances existing after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of future events even if experience or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by those forwardlooking statements will not be realized 

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10k other filings or in any other discussions of our business the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and item 8  financial statements and supplementary data 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results the risks described below are not our only risks additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business operating results andor financial condition in a material way 

our net sales profit results and cash flows are sensitive to and may be affected by general economic conditions consumer confidence spending patterns weather or other market disruptions 

our net sales profit cash flows and future growth may be affected by negative local regional national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers’ ability or willingness to spend including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war terrorism or the threat thereof in addition market disruptions due to severe weather conditions natural disasters health hazards or other major events or the prospect of these events could also impact consumer spending and confidence levels purchases of women’s intimate and other apparel beauty and personal care products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak in such circumstances we may increase the number of promotional sales which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the decision by the uk to leave the european union brexit has increased the uncertainty in the economic and political environment in europe in particular our business in the united kingdom may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates changes in trade policies or changes in labor immigration tax or other laws 

extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located particularly in markets where we have multiple stores could adversely affect our business for example heavy snowfall rainfall or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period might make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability 

our net sales operating income cash and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis 

we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

seasonal fluctuations also affect our cash and inventory levels since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases we must carry a significant amount of inventory especially before the holiday season selling period if we are not successful in selling inventory we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 7 

our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space 

most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers sales at these stores are derived in part from the volume of traffic in those retail areas our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area including “destination” retail stores to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by factors that we cannot control such as economic downturns or changes in consumer demographics in a particular area competition from internet and other retailers and other retail areas where we do not have stores the closing or decline in popularity of other stores in the shopping areas where our stores are located and the deterioration in the financial condition of the operators of the shopping areas or developers in which our stores are located 

part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs some of our store locations such as our victorias secret flagship stores require significant upfront capital investment and have material lease commitments additionally we are dependent upon the suitability of the lease spaces that we currently use the leases that we enter into are generally noncancellable leases with initial terms of ten years if we determine that it is no longer economical to operate a store and decide to close it we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new stores into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our plans for international expansion include risks that could impact our results and reputation 

we intend to further expand into international markets including mainland china and other international markets through partner arrangements andor companyowned stores the risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market further entry into other markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence other risks include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets volatility in the geopolitical landscape restrictions on the repatriation of funds held internationally disruptions or delays in shipments changes in diplomatic and trade relationships political instability and foreign governmental regulation such expansions will also have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance 

we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners in addition certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store openings and sales and their compliance with federal and local law we cannot ensure the profitability or success of our expansion into international markets 

further our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates see “fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations” below 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 8 

our licensees franchisees and wholesalers could take actions that could harm our business or brand images 

we have global representation through independently owned stores operated by our partners although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective partners the level of control we can exercise over our partners is limited and the quality and success of their operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control for example our partners may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel our brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our partners do not operate successfully these risks could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our direct channel businesses include risks that could have an effect on our results 

our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results risks include but are not limited to the difficulty in recreating the instore experience through our direct channels domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it outside our control our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in technology and logistics in order to appeal to existing and potential customers who increasingly rely on multiple channels to meet their shopping needs the failure of and risks related to the systems that operate our web infrastructure websites and the related support systems including computer viruses theft of customer information privacy concerns telecommunication failures and electronic breakins and similar disruptions and risks related to the fulfillment of directtoconsumer orders such as not adequately predicting customer demand 

our failure to maintain efficient and uninterrupted ordertaking and fulfillment operations could also have a material adverse effect on our results the satisfaction of our online customers depends on their timely receipt of merchandise if we encounter difficulties with the distribution facilities or if the facilities were to shut down for any reason including as a result of fire or other natural disaster or work stoppage we could face shortages of inventory incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers and cause customer dissatisfaction 

any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to protect our reputation could have a material effect on our brand images 

our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity any negative publicity including information publicized through traditional or social media platforms and similar venues such as blogs websites and other forums may affect our reputation and brand and consequently reduce demand for our merchandise even if such publicity is unverified or inaccurate 

failure to comply with ethical social product labor and environmental standards or related political considerations could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions including boycotts failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls to maintain the security of customer associate supplier or company information or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

if our marketing advertising and promotional programs are unsuccessful or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are our revenue or results of operations may be adversely affected 

customer traffic and demand for our merchandise is influenced by our advertising marketing and promotional activities the name recognition and reputation of our brands and the location of and service offered in our stores although we use marketing advertising and promotional programs to attract customers through various media including television social media database marketing and print some of our competitors may expend more for their programs than we do or use different approaches than we do which may provide them with a competitive advantage our programs may not be effective or could require increased expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations 

our ability to adequately protect our trade names trademarks and patents could have an impact on our brand images and ability to penetrate new markets 

we believe that our trade names trademarks and patents are important assets and an essential element of our strategy we have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names trademarks and patents and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries there can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others in particular the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us if any third party copies our products or our stores in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation it could have a 

 9 

material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could impact our results 

the sale of women’s intimate and other apparel personal care products and accessories is highly competitive we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers including individual and chain specialty stores department stores and discount retailers in addition to the traditional storebased retailers we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through online channels brand image marketing design price service assortment quality image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the storebased and online channels 

some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing and other resources available in many cases our competitors sell their products in stores that are located in the same shopping malls and centers as our stores in addition to competing for sales we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls and centers 

increased competition could result in price reductions increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to manage the life cycle of our brands and to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could impact the image and relevance of our brands 

our success depends in part on management’s ability to effectively manage the life cycle of our brands and to anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate saleable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly if we are unable to successfully anticipate identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines our sales will be lower potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory in response we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by our ability to adequately source distribute and sell merchandise and other materials on a global basis 

we source merchandise and other materials directly in international markets and in our domestic market we distribute merchandise and other materials globally to our partners in international locations and to our stores many of our imports and exports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements including existing or potential duties tariffs or safeguard quotas we compete with other companies for production facilities 

we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business on a global basis for example 

 we also rely upon thirdparty transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments including shipments to and from our distribution centers to our stores and to our customers our utilization of these delivery services for shipments is subject to risks including increases in fuel prices which would increase our shipping costs and associate strikes and inclement weather which may impact our transportation providers ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs 

 10 

our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we rely on a number of supplier and distribution facilities located in the same vicinity making our business susceptible to local and regional disruptions or adverse conditions 

to achieve the necessary speed and agility in producing our beauty personal care and home fragrance products we rely heavily on supplier and distribution facilities in close proximity to our headquarters in central ohio as a result of geographic concentration of the supplier and distribution   facilities that we rely upon our operations are susceptible to local and regional factors such as accidents system failures economic and weather conditions natural disasters demographic and population changes and other unforeseen events and circumstances any significant interruption in the operations of these facilities could lead to inventory issues or increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales profits assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition our royalty arrangements are calculated based on sales in local currency and as such we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations although we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency risks these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the shortterm negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations hedging would generally not be effective in offsetting the longterm impact of sustained shifts in foreign exchange rates on our business results as a result the fluctuation in the value of the us dollar against other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our stock price may be volatile 

our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry any guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe are reasonably attainable at the time guidance is given if or when we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us outside investment analysts or others our stock price could be adversely affected investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk 

in addition the stock market may experience price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance 

if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be harmed 

our dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future this ability may be subject to certain economic financial competitive and other factors that are beyond our control our board of directors may at its discretion decrease the level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation investor confidence in us and our stock price 

our ability to maintain our credit rating could affect our ability to access capital and could increase our interest expense 

the credit rating agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings a deterioration in our capital structure or the quality and stability of our earnings could result in a downgrade of our credit rating any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive if our ability to access capital becomes constrained our interest costs will likely increase which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows additionally changes to our credit rating could affect our future interest costs 

we may be impacted by our ability to service or refinance our debt 

we currently have substantial indebtedness some of our debt agreements contain covenants which require maintenance of certain financial ratios and also under certain conditions restrict our ability to pay dividends repurchase common shares and make other restricted payments as defined in those agreements our cash flow from operations provides the primary source of funds for our debt service payments if our cash flow from operations declines we may be unable to service or refinance our current debt 

 11 

we may be impacted by our ability to recruit train and retain key personnel 

we believe we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives including leslie h wexner chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit train and retain other qualified key personnel 

we may be impacted by our ability to attract develop and retain qualified associates and manage laborrelated costs 

we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer which requires us to have highly trained and engaged associates our success depends in part upon our ability to attract develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified associates including store personnel and talented merchants the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas competition for such qualified individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand delayed store openings significant increases in associate turnover rates or significant increases in laborrelated costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by our manufacturers ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner meet quality standards and comply with applicable laws and regulations 

we purchase products from thirdparty manufacturers factors outside our control such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales cancellation charges or excessive markdowns 

in addition quality problems could result in a product liability judgment or a widespread product recall that may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability competition reaction and consumer attitudes even if the product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertions could adversely impact our reputation with existing and potential customers and our brand image 

our business could also suffer if our thirdparty manufacturers fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations while our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our associates periodically visit and monitor the operations of our thirdparty manufacturers we do not control these manufacturers or their practices the violation of labor environmental or other laws by a thirdparty manufacturer used by us or the divergence of a thirdparty manufacturer’s or partner’s labor or environmental practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of finished products to us or damage our reputation

our ability to adequately protect our assets from loss and theft 

our assets are subject to loss including those caused by illegal or unethical conduct by associates customers vendors or unaffiliated third parties we have experienced events such as inventory shrinkage in the past and we cannot assure that incidences of loss and theft will decrease in the future or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce these losses higher rates of loss or increased security costs to combat theft could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results may be affected by fluctuations in energy costs 

energy costs have fluctuated dramatically in the past these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase products from our manufacturers a continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

we may be impacted by increases in costs of mailing paper and printing 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and promotional mailings we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to recover these costs or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing mailing delivery and order fulfillment systems these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we selfinsure certain risks and may be impacted by unfavorable claims experience

our ability to maintain the security of customer associate supplier or company information could have an impact on our reputation and our results 

information systems are susceptible to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks any significant compromise or breach of our data security could significantly damage our reputation with our customers associates investors and other third parties cause the disclosure of confidential customer associate supplier or company information cause our customers to stop shopping with us and result in significant legal regulatory and financial liabilities and lost revenues while we have implemented systems and processes to protect against unauthorized access to our information systems and prevent data loss there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches in addition to our own networks and databases we use thirdparty service providers to store process and transmit certain of this information on our behalf although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in their systems we have confidential security measures in place to protect our physical facilities and information technology systems from attacks despite these measures we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or similar events 

the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs such as costs related to organizational changes implementing additional protection technologies training associates and engaging consultants additionally we could incur lost revenues and face increased litigation as a result of any potential cybersecurity breach

it can be difficult to comply with sometimes conflicting regulations in local national or foreign jurisdictions as well as new or changing regulations also changes in such laws could make operating our business more expensive or require us to change the way we do business for example changes in product safety or other consumer protection laws could lead to increased costs for certain merchandise or additional labor costs associated with readying merchandise for sale it may be difficult for us to oversee regulatory changes impacting our business and our responses to changes in the law could be costly and may negatively impact our operations 

we may be adversely impacted by certain compliance or legal matters 

we along with third parties we do business with are subject to complex compliance and litigation risks actions filed against us from time to time include commercial tort intellectual property customer employment wage and hour data privacy securities anticorruption and other claims including purported class action lawsuits the cost of defending against these types of claims against us or the ultimate resolution of such claims whether by settlement or adverse court decision may harm our business further potential claimants may be encouraged to bring suits based on a settlement from us or adverse court decisions against us we cannot currently assess the likely outcome of such suits but if the outcome were negative it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows

in the past we entered into interest rate swap arrangements on the 2017 notes in 2016 we terminated our interest rate designated fair value hedges in conjunction with the repurchase of the 2017 notes

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

revenue from contracts with customers 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  which has been further clarified and amended in 2015 and 2016 this guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the new standard also will result in enhanced disclosures about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers this guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal 2018 with early adoption as of fiscal 2017 permitted the standard allows for either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective transition method 

we continue to evaluate the impacts of this standard our most significant changes to current accounting relate to the points earned under the victorias secret customer loyalty program and our accounting for sales returns the new standard will require a deferral of revenue associated with loyalty points using a relative fair value approach and also requires sales returns to be presented on a gross basis with the sales refund liability presented separately from the return asset we are continuing to evaluate the further impacts the standard will have on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income balance sheets and statements of cash flows we will adopt the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and are currently evaluating the transition method 

leases 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201602 leases  this guidance requires companies classified as lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to today’s accounting the new standard also will result in enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures including significant judgments made by management to provide greater insight into the extent of revenue and expense recognized and expected to be recognized from existing leases the standard requires modified retrospective adoption and will be effective beginning in fiscal 2019 with early adoption permitted 

we are currently evaluating the impacts that this standard will have on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income balance sheets and statements of cash flows including period of adoption we currently expect that most of our operating lease commitments will be subject to the new standard and recognized as operating lease liabilities and rightofuse assets upon adoption thus we expect adoption will result in a material increase to the assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 

simplifying the presentation of sharebased compensation 

in march 2016 the fasb issued asu no 201609 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  this guidance requires companies to recognize income tax effects of awards in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled it also will allow an employer to repurchase more of an employee’s shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur the standard also will require all taxrelated cash flows resulting from sharebased payments to be reported as operating activities on the statements of cash flows and any cash payments made to taxing authorities on an employees behalf as financing activities the standard is effective beginning in fiscal 2017 

this standard is expected to result in increased volatility to our income tax expense in future periods dependent upon among other variables the price of our common stock and the timing and volume of sharebased payment award activity such as employee exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock awards further the standard is expected to impact the operating and financing cash flows on our consolidated statements of cash flows we do not expect any further material impacts on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income balance sheets and statements of cash flows we will adopt asu 201609 in the first quarter of 2017

impact of inflation 

while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required we believe the effects of inflation if any on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements on an ongoing basis management evaluates its accounting policies estimates and judgments including those related to inventories longlived assets claims and contingencies income taxes and revenue recognition management bases our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position 

inventories 

inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or market on a weightedaverage cost basis 

we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of inventory on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

we also record inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory these estimates are based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends 

management believes that the assumptions used in these estimates are reasonable and appropriate a 10 increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 3 million  for 2016  a 10 increase or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 4 million  for 2016  

valuation of longlived assets 

property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than the carrying value we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset when a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life 

goodwill is reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change first we perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that each reporting units fair value is less than its carrying value including goodwill if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value we then estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities of that reporting unit including the implied fair value of goodwill through either estimated discounted future cash flows or marketbased methodologies if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference our reporting units are determined in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards codification asc topic 350 intangibles  goodwill and other  our reporting units that have goodwill are victorias secret stores victorias secret direct bath  body works stores and greater china 

intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount we estimate the fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset compare that value with its carrying amount and record an impairment charge if any 

 48 

we estimate the fair value of property and equipment goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of asc topic 820 fair value measurement  if future economic conditions are different than those projected by management future impairment charges may be required 

claims and contingencies 

we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits insurance regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business our determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the consolidated financial statements is based on management’s view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency we consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seek input from both internal and external experts with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business we accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible as opposed to probable or if an estimate is not reasonably determinable disclosure of a material claim or contingency is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our consolidated statement of income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized us deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed income of foreign subsidiaries where such earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested for the foreseeable future 

significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities in determining our provision for income taxes we consider permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates our effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings 

we follow the authoritative guidance included in asc topic 740 income taxes  which contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 

our income tax returns like those of most companies are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified we adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

although we believe that our estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

companyowned stores and direct channels 

while our recognition of revenue does not involve significant judgment revenue recognition represents an important accounting policy for our organization we recognize revenue upon customer receipt of the merchandise we also provide a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on prior experience for direct channel revenues we estimate shipments that have not been received by the customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times 

 49 

all of our brands sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers in retail stores through our direct channels and through third parties we do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards we recognize revenue from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer in addition we recognize revenue on unredeemed gift cards when we can determine that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions gift card breakage we determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns gift card breakage is included in net sales in our consolidated statements of income 

royalty and other 

we also recognize revenues associated with franchise license and wholesale arrangements revenue recognized under franchise and license arrangements generally consists of royalties earned and recognized upon sale of merchandise by franchise and license partners to retail customers revenue is generally recognized under wholesale and sourcing arrangements at the time the title passes to the partner 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates we use derivative financial instruments like crosscurrency swaps foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

foreign exchange rate risk 

we have operations in foreign countries which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to mitigate the translation risk to our earnings and the fair value of our canadian operations associated with fluctuations in the us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate we entered into a crosscurrency swap related to a canadian dollar denominated intercompany loan this crosscurrency swap requires the periodic exchange of fixed rate canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate us dollar interest payments as well as exchange of canadian dollar and us dollar principal payments upon maturity the swap arrangement matures in january 2018 at the same time as the related loan as a result of the canadian dollar denominated intercompany loan and the related crosscurrency swap we do not believe there is any material translation risk to our canadian net earnings associated with fluctuations in the us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate 

in addition our canadian dollar british pound chinese yuan and hong kong dollar denominated earnings are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all of our merchandise sold in canada the uk and greater china is sourced through us dollar transactions although we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset risks associated with canadian dollar and british pound denominated earnings these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the shortterm impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally may not be effective in offsetting the longterm impact of sustained shifts in foreign currency rates 

further although our royalty arrangements with our international partners are denominated in us dollars the royalties we receive in us dollars are calculated based on sales in the local currency as a result our royalties in these arrangements are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

interest rate risk 

our investment portfolio primarily consists of interestbearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which specifies permitted types of investments specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer the primary objective of our investment activities are the preservation of principal the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk typically our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of us government obligations us treasury and aaarated money market funds commercial paper and bank deposits given the shortterm nature and quality of investments in our portfolio we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates 

the majority of our longterm debt as of january 28 2017  has fixed interest rates we will from time to time adjust our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap arrangements as of january 28 2017  we have interest rate swap arrangements with notional amounts of 300 million  related to a portion of our 2019 notes 

the effect of the interest rate swap arrangements is to convert the respective amount of debt from a fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate the variable interest rate associated with these swap arrangements fluctuates based on changes in the threemonth libor 

 50 

for the balance of our longterm debt that is not subject to interest rate swap arrangements our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows 

fair value of financial instruments 

as of january 28 2017  we believe that the carrying values of accounts receivable accounts payable accrued expenses and current debt approximate fair value because of their short maturity 

the following table provides a summary of the principal value and fair value of longterm debt and swap arrangements as of january 28 2017  and january 30 2016  

  



 

 concentration of credit risk 

we maintain cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions we monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity typically our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of us government obligations us treasury and aaarated money market funds commercial paper and bank deposits we also periodically review the relative credit standing of franchise license and wholesale partners and other entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business

 item 1a risk factors 

we caution that any forwardlooking statements as such term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 contained in this report or made by our company or our management involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors many of which are beyond our control accordingly our future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forwardlooking statements words such as “estimate” “project” “plan” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “planned” “potential” and any similar expressions may identify forwardlooking statements risks associated with the following factors among others in some cases have affected and in the future could affect our financial performance and actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forwardlooking statements included in this report or otherwise made by our company or our management 

  6 

 we are not under any obligation and do not intend to make publicly available any update or other revisions to any of the forwardlooking statements contained in this report to reflect circumstances existing after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of future events even if experience or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by those forwardlooking statements will not be realized 

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10k other filings or in any other discussions of our business the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and item 8  financial statements and supplementary data 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results the risks described below are not our only risks additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business operating results andor financial condition in a material way 

our net sales profit results and cash flows are sensitive to and may be affected by general economic conditions consumer confidence spending patterns weather or other market disruptions 

our net sales profit cash flows and future growth may be affected by negative local regional national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers’ ability or willingness to spend including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war terrorism or the threat thereof in addition market disruptions due to severe weather conditions natural disasters health hazards or other major events or the prospect of these events could also impact consumer spending and confidence levels purchases of women’s intimate and other apparel beauty and personal care products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak in such circumstances we may increase the number of promotional sales which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located particularly in markets where we have multiple stores could adversely affect our business for example heavy snowfall rainfall or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period might make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability 

our net sales operating income cash and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis 

we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

seasonal fluctuations also affect our cash and inventory levels since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases we must carry a significant amount of inventory especially before the holiday season selling period if we are not successful in selling inventory we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space 

most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers sales at these stores are derived in part from the volume of traffic in those retail areas our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area including “destination” retail stores to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by factors that we cannot control such as economic downturns or changes in consumer demographics in a particular area competition from internet and other retailers and other retail areas where we do 

 7 

not have stores the closing or decline in popularity of other stores in the shopping areas where our stores are located and the deterioration in the financial condition of the operators of the shopping areas or developers in which our stores are located 

part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs some of our store locations such as our victorias secret flagship stores require significant upfront capital investment and have material lease commitments additionally we are dependent upon the suitability of the lease spaces that we currently use the leases that we enter into are generally noncancelable leases with initial terms of ten years if we determine that it is no longer economical to operate a store and decide to close it we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new stores into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow and results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our plans for international expansion include risks that could impact our results and reputation 

we intend to further expand into international markets including mainland china and other international markets through partner arrangements andor companyowned stores the risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market further entry into other markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence other risks include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets disruptions or delays in shipments changes in diplomatic and trade relationships political instability and foreign governmental regulation such expansions will also have upfront investment costs that may not be accompanied by sufficient revenues to achieve typical or expected operational and financial performance 

we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners in addition certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store openings and sales and their compliance with federal and local law we cannot ensure the profitability or success of our expansion into international markets 

further our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates see “fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations” below 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our licensees franchisees and wholesalers could take actions that could harm our business or brand images 

we have global representation through independently owned stores operated by our partners although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective partners the level of control we can exercise over our partners is limited and the quality and success of their operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control for example our partners may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel our brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our partners do not operate successfully these risks could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our direct channel businesses include risks that could have an effect on our results 

our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results risks include but are not limited to the difficulty in recreating the instore experience through our direct channels domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it outside our control our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in 

 8 

technology and logistics in order to appeal to existing and potential customers who increasingly rely on multiple channels to meet their shopping needs the failure of and risks related to the systems that operate our web infrastructure websites and the related support systems including computer viruses theft of customer information privacy concerns telecommunication failures and electronic breakins and similar disruptions and risks related to the fulfillment of directtoconsumer orders such as not adequately predicting customer demand 

our failure to maintain efficient and uninterrupted ordertaking and fulfillment operations could also have a material adverse effect on our results the satisfaction of our online customers depends on their timely receipt of merchandise if we encounter difficulties with the distribution facilities or if the facilities were to shut down for any reason including as a result of fire or other natural disaster or work stoppage we could face shortages of inventory incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers and cause customer dissatisfaction 

any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to protect our reputation could have a material effect on our brand images 

our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity any negative publicity including information publicized through traditional or social media platforms and similar venues such as blogs websites and other forums may affect our reputation and brand and consequently reduce demand for our merchandise even if such publicity is unverified or inaccurate 

failure to comply with ethical social product labor and environmental standards or related political considerations could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions including boycotts failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls to maintain the security of customer associate supplier or company information or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

if our marketing advertising and promotional programs are unsuccessful or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are our revenue or results of operations may be adversely affected 

customer traffic and demand for our merchandise is influenced by our advertising marketing and promotional activities the name recognition and reputation of our brands and the location of and service offered in our stores although we use marketing advertising and promotional programs to attract customers through various media including television social media database marketing and print some of our competitors may expend more for their programs than we do or use different approaches than we do which may provide them with a competitive advantage our programs may not be effective or could require increased expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations 

our ability to adequately protect our trade names trademarks and patents could have an impact on our brand images and ability to penetrate new markets 

we believe that our trade names trademarks and patents are important assets and an essential element of our strategy we have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names trademarks and patents and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries there can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others in particular the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states if any thirdparty copies our products or our stores in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation it could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could impact our results 

the sale of women’s intimate and other apparel personal care products and accessories is highly competitive we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers including individual and chain specialty stores department stores and discount retailers in addition to the traditional storebased retailers we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through online channels brand image marketing design price service assortment quality image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the storebased and online channels 

some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing and other resources available in many cases our competitors sell their products in stores that are located in the same shopping malls and centers as our stores in addition to competing for sales we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls and centers 

 9 

increased competition could result in price reductions increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could impact the image and relevance of our brands 

our success depends in part on management’s ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate saleable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly if we are unable to successfully anticipate identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines our sales will be lower potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory in response we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by our ability to adequately source distribute and sell merchandise and other materials on a global basis 

we source merchandise and other materials directly in international markets and in our domestic market we distribute merchandise and other materials globally to our partners in international locations and to our stores many of our imports and exports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements including existing or potential duties tariffs or safeguard quotas we compete with other companies for production facilities 

we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business on a global basis for example 

 we also rely upon thirdparty transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments including shipments to and from our distribution centers our stores and to our customers our utilization of these delivery services for shipments is subject to risks including increases in fuel prices which would increase our shipping costs and employee strikes and inclement weather which may impact our transportation providers ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs 

our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we rely on a number of supplier and distribution facilities located in the same vicinity making our business susceptible to local and regional disruptions or adverse conditions 

to achieve the necessary speed and agility in producing our beauty personal care and home fragrance products we rely heavily on supplier and distribution facilities in close proximity to our headquarters in central ohio as a result of geographic concentration of the supplier and distribution   facilities that we rely upon our operations are susceptible to local and regional factors such as accidents system failures economic and weather conditions natural disasters demographic and population changes and other unforeseen events and circumstances any significant interruption in the operations of these facilities could lead to inventory issues or increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales profits assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition our royalty arrangements are calculated based on sales in local currency and as such we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations although we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency risks these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the shortterm negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations hedging would generally not be effective in offsetting the longterm impact of sustained shifts in foreign exchange rates on our business results as a result the fluctuation in the value of the us dollar against other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our stock price may be volatile 

our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry any guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable if or when we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us outside investment analysts or others our stock price could be adversely affected investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk 

in addition the stock market may experience price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance 

if we are unable to pay quarterly dividends at intended levels our reputation and stock price may be harmed 

our dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flow our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future this ability may be subject to certain economic financial competitive and other factors that are beyond our control our board of directors may at its discretion decrease the level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation investor confidence in us and negatively impact our stock price 

our ability to maintain our credit rating could affect our ability to access capital and could increase our interest expense 

the credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings a deterioration in our capital structure or the quality and stability of our earnings could result in a downgrade of our credit rating any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive if our ability to access capital becomes constrained our interest costs will likely increase which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows additionally changes to our credit rating could affect our future interest costs 

we may be impacted by our ability to service or refinance our debt 

we currently have substantial indebtedness some of our debt agreements contain covenants which require maintenance of certain financial ratios and also under certain conditions restrict our ability to pay dividends repurchase common shares and make other restricted payments as defined in those agreements our cash flow from operations provides the primary source of funds for our debt service payments if our cash flow from operations declines we may be unable to service or refinance our current debt 

we may be impacted by our ability to recruit train and retain key personnel 

we believe we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives including leslie h wexner chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit train and retain other qualified key personnel 

we may be impacted by our ability to attract develop and retain qualified employees and manage laborrelated costs 

we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer which requires us to have highly trained and engaged employees our success depends in part upon our ability to attract develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including store personnel and talented merchants the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these 

 11 

positions may be in short supply in some areas competition for such qualified individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand delayed store openings significant increases in employee turnover rates or significant increases in laborrelated costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by our manufacturers ability to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner meet quality standards and comply with applicable laws and regulations 

we purchase products through contract manufacturers and importers and directly from thirdparty manufacturers factors outside our control such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales cancellation charges or excessive markdowns 

in addition quality problems could result in a product liability judgment or a widespread product recall that may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability competition reaction and consumer attitudes even if the product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertions could adversely impact our reputation with existing and potential customers and our brand image 

our business could also suffer if our thirdparty manufacturers fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations while our internal and vendor operating guidelines promote ethical business practices and our employees periodically visit and monitor the operations of our thirdparty manufacturers we do not control these manufacturers or their practices the violation of labor environmental or other laws by a thirdparty manufacturer used by us or the divergence of a thirdparty manufacturer’s or partner’s labor or environmental practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment or finished products to us or damage our reputation 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results may be affected by fluctuations in product input costs 

product input costs including manufacturing freight labor and raw materials fluctuate these fluctuations may result in an increase in our production costs we may not be able to or may elect not to pass these increases on to our customers which may adversely impact our profit margins these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results may be affected by fluctuations in energy costs 

energy costs have fluctuated dramatically in the past these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase products from our manufacturers a continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by increases in costs of mailing paper and printing 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and promotional mailings we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to recover these costs or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing mailing delivery and order fulfillment systems these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we selfinsure certain risks and may be impacted by unfavorable claims experience 

we are selfinsured for various types of insurable risks including associate medical benefits workers’ compensation property general liability and automobile up to certain stoploss limits claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile any adverse claims experience could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 12 

we significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems and to protect associated data 

our success depends in part on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems our information technology systems as well as those of our service providers are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources including telecommunication failures malicious human acts and natural disasters moreover despite network security measures some of our servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses and similar disruptive problems additionally these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer merchandise financial or other important information which could result in damage to our reputation andor litigation the increased use of smartphones tablets and other mobile devices may also heighten these and other operational risks despite the precautions we have taken unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems sustained or repeated system disruptions that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores impact our consumers ability to access our websites in a timely manner or expose confidential customer merchandise financial or other important information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition from time to time we make modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for pointofsale ecommerce merchandising planning sourcing logistics inventory management and support systems including human resources and finance modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems including not accurately capturing data and system disruptions information technology system disruptions if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to maintain the security of customer associate supplier or company information could have an impact on our reputation and our results 

information systems are susceptible to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks any significant compromise or breach of our data security could significantly damage our reputation with our customers employees investors and other third parties cause the disclosure of confidential customer associate supplier or company information cause our customers to stop shopping with us and result in significant legal regulatory and financial liabilities and lost revenues while we have implemented systems and processes to protect against unauthorized access to our information systems and prevent data loss there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches in addition to our own networks and databases we use thirdparty service providers to store process and transmit certain of this information on our behalf although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in their systems we have confidential security measures in place to protect our physical facilities and information technology systems from attacks despite these measures we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or similar events 

the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs such as costs related to organizational changes implementing additional protection technologies training employees and engaging consultants additionally we could incur lost revenues and face increased litigation as a result of any potential cybersecurity breach 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by our ability to comply with regulatory requirements 

we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements our policies procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable foreign and domestic laws and regulations including those required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act the sec and the new york stock exchange the “nyse” among others although we have put in place policies and procedures aimed at ensuring legal and regulatory compliance our employees subcontractors vendors licensees franchisees and suppliers could take actions that violate these laws and regulations any violations of such laws or regulations could have an adverse effect on our reputation market price of our common stock results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 13 

it can be difficult to comply with sometimes conflicting regulations in local national or foreign jurisdictions as well as new or changing regulations also changes in such laws could make operating our business more expensive or require us to change the way we do business for example changes in product safety or other consumer protection laws could lead to increased costs for certain merchandise or additional labor costs associated with readying merchandise for sale it may be difficult for us to oversee regulatory changes impacting our business and our responses to changes in the law could be costly and may negatively impact our operations 

we may be adversely impacted by certain compliance or legal matters 

we along with third parties we do business with are subject to complex compliance and litigation risks actions filed against us from time to time include commercial tort intellectual property customer employment wage and hour data privacy securities anticorruption and other claims including purported class action lawsuits the cost of defending against these types of claims against us or the ultimate resolution of such claims whether by settlement or adverse court decision may harm our business further potential claimants may be encouraged to bring suits based on a settlement from us or adverse court decisions against us we cannot currently assess the likely outcome of such suits but if the outcome were negative it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition we may be impacted by litigation trends including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation market price of our common stock results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be impacted by changes in taxation requirements 

we are subject to income tax in local national and international jurisdictions in addition our products are subject to import and excise duties andor sales or valueadded taxes in many jurisdictions we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations fluctuations in tax rates and duties changes in tax legislation or regulation or adverse outcomes of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

repayment of notes 

in november 2014 we repaid the remaining 213 million  of our 525  senior unsecured notes due november 2014 with cash on hand 

revolving facilities 

we maintain a secured revolving credit facility “revolving facility” the revolving facility has aggregate availability of 1 billion  and expires july 18 2019 the fees related to committed and unutilized amounts per year are 030  per annum and the fees related to outstanding letters of credit are 150  per annum in addition the interest rate on outstanding us dollar borrowings or british pound borrowings is libor plus 150  the interest rate on outstanding canadian dollar borrowings is cdor plus 150  per annum 

the revolving facility contains fixed charge coverage and debt to ebitda financial covenants we are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 175  to 100  and a consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda ratio not exceeding 400  to 100  for the most recent fourquarter period in addition the revolving facility provides that investments and restricted payments may be made without limitation on amount if a at the time of and after giving effect to such investment or restricted payment the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda for the most recent fourquarter period is less than 300  to 100  and b no default or event of default exists as of january 30 2016  we were in compliance with both of our financial covenants the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda was less than 300  to 100  and no default or event of default existed

as of january 30 2016  there were no  borrowings outstanding under the revolving facility 

the revolving facility also supports our letter of credit program we had 8 million  of outstanding letters of credit as of january 30 2016  that reduce our remaining availability under our amended credit agreements 

in addition to the revolving facility we maintain various revolving and term loan bank facilities with availability totaling 35 million  to support our foreign operations foreign facilities these foreign facilities mature between november 15 2016 and july 30 2017 the interest rates on outstanding borrowings are based upon the applicable benchmark rate for the currency of each borrowing

fair value interest rate swap arrangements 

in july 2014 we entered into interest rate swap arrangements related to 100 million  of the outstanding 2017 notes and 100 million  of the outstanding 2019 notes in 2013 we entered into interest rate swap arrangements related to 200 million  of the outstanding 2017 notes and 200 million  of the outstanding 2019 notes the interest rate swap arrangements effectively convert the fixed interest rate on the related debt to a variable interest rate based on libor plus a fixed percentage 

 42 

the swap arrangements are designated as fair value hedges the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps have an equal and offsetting impact to the carrying value of the debt on the balance sheet the differential to be paid or received on the interest rate swap arrangements is accrued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 

in the past we had entered into interest rate swap arrangements on the 2017 notes in 2012 we terminated these interest rate designated fair value hedges the carrying values of the 2017 notes include unamortized hedge settlements which are amortized as a reduction to interest expense through the maturity date of the notes

while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required we believe the effects of inflation if any on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements on an ongoing basis management evaluates its accounting policies estimates and judgments including those related to inventories longlived assets claims and contingencies income taxes and revenue recognition management bases our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position 

inventories 

inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or market on a weightedaverage cost basis 

we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of inventory on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

we also record inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory these estimates are based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends 

management believes that the assumptions used in these estimates are reasonable and appropriate a 10 increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 2 million  for 2015  a 10 increase or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 3 million  for 2015  

valuation of longlived assets 

property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than the carrying value we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset when a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life 

goodwill is reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change first we perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that each reporting units fair value is less than its carrying value including goodwill if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value we then estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities of that reporting unit including the implied fair value of goodwill through either estimated discounted future cash flows or marketbased methodologies if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference our reporting units are determined in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards codification asc topic 350 intangibles  goodwill and other  our reporting units that have goodwill are victorias secret stores victorias secret direct and bath  body works 

 49 

intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount we estimate the fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset compare that value with its carrying amount and record an impairment charge if any 

we estimate the fair value of property and equipment goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of asc topic 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  if future economic conditions are different than those projected by management future impairment charges may be required 

claims and contingencies 

we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits insurance regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business our determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the consolidated financial statements is based on management’s view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency we consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seek input from both internal and external experts with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business we accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible as opposed to probable or if an estimate is not reasonably determinable disclosure of a material claim or contingency is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our consolidated statement of income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized us deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed income of foreign subsidiaries where such earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested for the foreseeable future 

significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities in determining our provision for income taxes we consider permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates our effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings 

we follow the authoritative guidance included in asc topic 740 income taxes  which contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 

our income tax returns like those of most companies are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified we adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

although we believe that our estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements

revenue recognition 

companyowned stores and direct channels 

while our recognition of revenue does not involve significant judgment revenue recognition represents an important accounting policy for our organization we recognize revenue upon customer receipt of the merchandise we also provide a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on prior experience for direct channel revenues we estimate shipments that have not been received by the customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times 

all of our brands sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers in retail stores through our direct channels and through third parties we do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards we recognize income from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer in addition we recognize income on unredeemed gift cards when we can determine that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions gift card breakage we determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns gift card breakage is included in net sales in our consolidated statements of income 

royalty and other 

we also recognize revenues associated with franchise license and wholesale arrangements revenue recognized under franchise and license arrangements generally consists of royalties earned and recognized upon sale of merchandise by franchise and license partners to retail customers revenue is generally recognized under wholesale arrangements at the time the title passes to the partner 

we recognize revenue associated with merchandise sourcing and production services provided to third parties revenue is recognized at the time the title passes to the customer 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates we use derivative financial instruments like crosscurrency swaps forward contracts and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

foreign exchange rate risk 

we have operations in foreign countries which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to mitigate the translation risk to our earnings and the fair value of our canadian operations associated with fluctuations in the us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate we entered into a crosscurrency swap related to a canadian dollar denominated intercompany loan this crosscurrency swap requires the periodic exchange of fixed rate canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate us dollar interest payments as well as exchange of canadian dollar and us dollar principal payments upon maturity the swap arrangement matures in january 2018 at the same time as the related loan as a result of the canadian dollar denominated intercompany loan and the related crosscurrency swap we do not believe there is any material translation risk to our canadian net earnings associated with fluctuations in the us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate 

in addition our canadian dollar and british pound denominated earnings are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all of our merchandise sold in canada and the uk is sourced through us dollar transactions although we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset these risks these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the shortterm impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally may not be effective in offsetting the longterm impact of sustained shifts in foreign currency rates 

further although our royalty arrangements with our international partners are denominated in us dollars the royalties we receive in us dollars are calculated based on sales in the local currency as a result our royalties in these arrangements are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

interest rate risk 

our investment portfolio primarily consists of interestbearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which specifies permitted types of investments specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer the primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of principal the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk currently our investment portfolio is comprised of us government obligations us treasury and aaarated money market funds highly rated commercial paper and bank 

 51 

deposits given the shortterm nature and quality of investments in our portfolio we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates 

all of our longterm debt as of january 30 2016  has fixed interest rates we will from time to time adjust our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap arrangements as of january 30 2016  we have interest rate swap arrangements with notional amounts of 300 million related to a portion of our 2017 notes and 300 million related to a portion of our 2019 notes 

the effect of the interest rate swap arrangements is to convert the respective amount of debt from a fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate the variable interest rate associated with these swap arrangements fluctuates based on changes in the threemonth libor 

for the balance of our longterm debt that is not subject to interest rate swap arrangements our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows 

fair value of financial instruments 

as of january 30 2016  management believes that the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents receivables and payables approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments 

the following table provides a summary of the principal value and fair value of longterm debt and swap arrangements as of january 30 2016  and january 31 2015  

  



 

 concentration of credit risk 

we maintain cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions we monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity we also periodically review the relative credit standing of franchise license and wholesale partners and other entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business

 item 1a risk factors 

we caution that any forwardlooking statements as such term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 contained in this report or made by our company or our management involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors many of which are beyond our control accordingly our future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forwardlooking statements words such as “estimate” “project” “plan” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “planned” “potential” and any similar expressions may identify forwardlooking statements risks associated with the following factors among others in some cases have affected and in the future could affect our financial performance and actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forwardlooking statements included in this report or otherwise made by our company or our management 

  6 

 we are not under any obligation and do not intend to make publicly available any update or other revisions to any of the forwardlooking statements contained in this report to reflect circumstances existing after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of future events even if experience or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by those forwardlooking statements will not be realized 

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10k other filings or in any other discussions of our business the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and item 8  financial statements and supplementary data 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results the risks described below are not our only risks additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business operating results andor financial condition in a material way 

our net sales profit results and cash flow are sensitive to and may be adversely affected by general economic conditions consumer confidence spending patterns and weather or other market disruptions 

our net sales profit cash flows and future growth may be adversely affected by negative local regional national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers’ ability or willingness to spend including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war terrorism or the threat thereof in addition market disruptions due to severe weather conditions natural disasters health hazards or other major events or the prospect of these events could also impact consumer spending and confidence levels purchases of women’s intimate and other apparel beauty and personal care products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak in such circumstances we may increase the number of promotional sales which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located particularly in markets where we have multiple stores could adversely affect our business for example heavy snowfall rainfall or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period might make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability 

our net sales operating income cash and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis 

we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

seasonal fluctuations also affect our cash and inventory levels since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases we must carry a significant amount of inventory especially before the holiday season selling period if we are not successful in selling inventory we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space 

most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers sales at these stores are derived in part from the volume of traffic in those retail areas our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area including “destination” retail stores to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area competition from other retail and nonretail attractions and other retail areas where we do not have stores 

part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 7 

our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new stores into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our plans for international expansion include risks that could adversely impact our results and reputation 

we intend to further expand into international markets through partner arrangements andor companyowned stores the risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market further entry into other markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence other risks include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets disruptions or delays in shipments changes in diplomatic and trade relationships political instability and foreign governmental regulation 

we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners in addition certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store openings and sales and their compliance with federal and local law we cannot ensure the profitability or success of our expansion into international markets 

in addition our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our licensees franchisees and wholesalers could take actions that could harm our business or brand images 

we have global representation through independently owned stores operated by our partners although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective partners the level of control we can exercise over our partners is limited and the quality and success of their operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control our partners may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel our brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our partners do not operate successfully these risks could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our direct channel businesses include risks that could have an adverse effect on our results 

our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results risks include but are not limited to the difficulty in recreating the instore experience through our direct channels domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it outside our control the maintenance and security of the internet infrastructure our ability to anticipate and implement innovations in technology and logistics in order to appeal to existing and potential customers who increasingly rely on multiple channels to meet their shopping needs the failure of and risks related to the systems that operate our websites and the related support systems including computer viruses theft of customer information privacy concerns telecommunication failures and electronic breakins and similar disruptions and risks related to the fulfillment of directtoconsumer orders such as not adequately predicting customer demand 

our failure to maintain efficient and uninterrupted ordertaking and fulfillment operations could also have a material adverse effect on our results the satisfaction of our online customers depends on their timely receipt of merchandise if we encounter difficulties with the distribution facilities or if the facilities were to shut down for any reason including as a result of fire or other natural disaster or work stoppage we could face shortages of inventory incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our customers and cause customer dissatisfaction 

any of these issues could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition and cash flows

our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand images 

our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise failure to comply with ethical social product labor and environmental standards or related political considerations could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions including boycotts failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls to maintain the security of customer associate supplier or company information or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

our failure to adequately protect our trade names trademarks and patents could have a negative impact on our brand images and limit our ability to penetrate new markets 

we believe that our trade names trademarks and patents are important assets and an essential element of our strategy we have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names trademarks and patents and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries there can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others if any thirdparty copies our products or our stores in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation it could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our inability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could negatively impact our results 

the sale of women’s intimate and other apparel personal care products and accessories is highly competitive we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers including individual and chain specialty stores department stores and discount retailers in addition to the traditional storebased retailers we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through online channels brand image marketing design price service quality image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the storebased and online channels 

some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing and other resources available in many cases our competitors sell their products in stores that are located in the same shopping malls as our stores in addition to competing for sales we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls 

increased competition could result in price reductions increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our inability to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could negatively impact the image and relevance of our brands 

our success depends in part on management’s ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate saleable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly if we are unable to successfully anticipate identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines our sales will be lower potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory in response we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be adversely impacted by our inability to adequately source distribute and sell merchandise and other materials on a global basis 

we source merchandise and other materials directly in international markets and in our domestic market we distribute merchandise and other materials globally to our partners in international locations and to our stores many of our imports and exports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements including existing or potential duties tariffs or safeguard quotas we compete with other companies for production facilities 

we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business on a global basis such as 

  9 

 we also rely upon thirdparty transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments including shipments to and from our distribution centers our stores and to our customers our utilization of these delivery services for shipments is subject to risks including increases in fuel prices which would increase our shipping costs and employee strikes and inclement weather which may impact our transportation providers ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs 

new initiatives may be proposed impacting the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions which if enacted could impact our trading relationships with vendors or other parties in such countries 

in addition significant health hazards environmental hazards or natural disasters may occur which could have a negative effect on the economies financial markets and business activity of international markets 

our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales profits assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in addition our royalty arrangements are calculated based on sales in local currency and as such we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations although we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency risks these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the shortterm negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations hedging would generally not be effective in offsetting the longterm impact of sustained shifts in foreign exchange rates on our business results as a result the fluctuation in the value of the us dollar against other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our stock price may be volatile 

our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry in addition the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 

our failure to maintain our credit rating could negatively affect our ability to access capital and could increase our interest expense 

the credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings a deterioration in our capital structure or the quality and stability of our earnings could result in a downgrade of our credit rating any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive if our ability to access capital becomes constrained our interest costs will likely increase which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows additionally changes to our credit rating could affect our interest costs 

we may be unable to service or refinance our debt 

some of our debt agreements contain covenants which require maintenance of certain financial ratios and also under certain conditions restrict our ability to pay dividends repurchase common shares and make other restricted payments as defined in those agreements our cash flow from operations provides the primary source of funds for our debt service payments if our cash flow from operations declines we may be unable to service or refinance our current debt 

 10 

we may be unable to recruit train and retain key personnel 

we believe we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives including leslie h wexner chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit train and retain other qualified key personnel 

we may be unable to attract develop and retain qualified employees and manage laborrelated costs 

we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer which requires us to have highly trained and engaged employees our success depends in part upon our ability to attract develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including store personnel and talented merchants the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas competition for such qualified individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand delayed store openings significant increases in employee turnover rates or significant increases in laborrelated costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner and meet quality standards 

we purchase products through contract manufacturers and importers and directly from thirdparty manufacturers factors outside our control such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales cancellation charges or excessive markdowns in addition quality problems could result in a product liability judgment or a widespread product recall that may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability competition reaction and consumer attitudes even if the product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertions could adversely impact our reputation with existing and potential customers and our brand image these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in product input costs 

product input costs including manufacturing labor and raw materials fluctuate these fluctuations may result in an increase in our production costs we may not be able to or may elect not to pass these increases on to our customers which may adversely impact our profit margins these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in energy costs 

energy costs have fluctuated dramatically in the past these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase products from our manufacturers a continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be adversely impacted by increases in costs of mailing paper and printing 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and promotional mailings we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to recover these costs or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing mailing delivery and order fulfillment systems these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we selfinsure certain risks and may be adversely impacted by unfavorable claims experience 

we are selfinsured for various types of insurable risks including associate medical benefits workers’ compensation property general liability and automobile up to certain stoploss limits claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile any adverse claims experience could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 11 

we significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems and to protect associated data 

our success depends in part on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems our information technology systems as well as those of our service providers are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources including telecommunication failures malicious human acts and natural disasters moreover despite network security measures some of our servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses and similar disruptive problems additionally these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer merchandise financial or other important information which could result in damage to our reputation andor litigation the increased use of smartphones tablets and other mobile devices may also heighten these and other operational risks despite the precautions we have taken unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores or impact our consumers ability to access our websites in a timely manner or expose confidential customer merchandise financial or other important information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition from time to time we make modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for pointofsale ecommerce merchandising planning sourcing logistics inventory management and support systems including human resources and finance modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems including not accurately capturing data and system disruptions information technology system disruptions if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have a material adverse effect on our operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may fail to maintain the security of customer associate supplier or company information which could have a negative impact on our reputation and our results 

information systems are susceptible to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks any significant compromise or breach of our data security could significantly damage our reputation with our customers employees investors and other third parties cause the disclosure of confidential customer associate supplier or company information cause our customers to stop shopping with us and result in significant legal regulatory and financial liabilities and lost revenues while we have implemented systems and processes to protect against unauthorized access to our information systems and prevent data loss there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches in addition to our own networks and databases we use thirdparty service providers to store process and transmit certain of this information on our behalf although we contractually require these service providers to implement and use reasonable security measures we cannot control third parties and cannot guarantee that a security breach will not occur in their systems we have confidential security measures in place to protect our physical facilities and information technology systems from attacks despite these measures we may be vulnerable to targeted or random security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or similar events 

the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs such as costs related to organizational changes implementing additional protection technologies training employees and engaging consultants additionally we could incur lost revenues and face increased litigation as a result of any potential cybersecurity breach 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

we may fail to comply with regulatory requirements 

we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements our policies procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable foreign and domestic laws and regulations including those required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act the sec and the new york stock exchange the “nyse” failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our reputation market price of our common stock results of operations financial condition and cash flows

we may be adversely impacted by changes in taxation requirements 

we are subject to income tax in local national and international jurisdictions in addition our products are subject to import and excise duties andor sales or valueadded taxes in many jurisdictions the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations fluctuations in tax rates and duties changes in tax legislation or regulation or adverse outcomes of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be adversely impacted by certain compliance or legal matters 

we along with third parties we do business with are subject to complex compliance and litigation risks actions filed against our company from time to time include commercial tort intellectual property customer employment data privacy securities anticorruption and other claims including purported class action lawsuits difficulty can exist in complying with sometimes conflicting regulations in local national or foreign jurisdictions as well as new or changing regulations that affect how we operate in addition we may be impacted by litigation trends including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation market price of our common stock results of operations financial condition and cash flows

off balance sheet arrangements 

we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined by regulation 229303 item 303 a 4 

impact of inflation 

while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required we believe the effects of inflation if any on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements on an ongoing basis management evaluates its accounting policies estimates and judgments including those related to inventories longlived assets claims and contingencies income taxes and revenue recognition management bases our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position 

inventories 

inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or market on a weightedaverage cost basis 

we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of inventory on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

we also record inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory these estimates are based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends 

management believes that the assumptions used in these estimates are reasonable and appropriate a 10 increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 2 million  for 2014  a 10 increase or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 3 million  for 2014

valuation of longlived assets 

property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than the carrying value we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset when a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we concluded that the continued negative operating results of the henri bendel business were an indicator of potential impairment of the henri bendel longlived store assets we calculated the impairment by comparing the estimated discounted cash flows at each store to its respective carrying value and recognized an impairment charge of 27 million this impairment charge is included in cost of goods sold buying  occupancy in the 2012 consolidated statement of income based on the evaluation performed in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 2013 we concluded that no impairment charge was necessary in 2014 or 2013 the remaining carrying value of the henri bendel longlived stores assets was 4 million and 5 million as of january 31 2015  and february 1 2014  respectively 

goodwill is reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change first pursuant to accounting standards update asu 201108 testing goodwill for impairment  we perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that each reporting units fair value is less than its carrying value including goodwill if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value we then estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities of that reporting unit including the implied fair value of goodwill through either estimated discounted future cash flows or marketbased methodologies if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference our reporting units are determined in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards codification asc topic 350 intangibles  goodwill and other  our reporting units that have goodwill are victorias secret stores victorias secret direct and bath  body works 

the carrying value of goodwill for la senza was reduced to zero as of february 2 2013 due to impairments of 189 million 119 million and 12 million in 2008 2011 and 2012 respectively for additional information see note 7  to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplemental data 

intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change pursuant to asu 201202 testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment  we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount we estimate the fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset compare that value with its carrying amount and record an impairment charge if any 

the carrying value of trade names for la senza was reduced to zero as of february 2 2013 due to impairments of 26 million 3 million 113 million and 81 million in 2008 2009 2011 and 2012 respectively for additional information see note 7  to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplemental data 

we estimate the fair value of property and equipment goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of asc topic 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  if future economic conditions are different than those projected by management future impairment charges may be required 

claims and contingencies 

we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits insurance regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business our determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the consolidated financial statements is based on management’s view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency we consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seek input from both internal and external experts with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business we accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible as opposed to probable or if an estimate is not reasonably determinable disclosure of a material claim or contingency is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data 

 49 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our consolidated statement of income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized us deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed income of foreign subsidiaries where such earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested for the foreseeable future 

significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities in determining our provision for income taxes we consider permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates our effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings 

we follow the authoritative guidance included in asc topic 740 income taxes  which contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 

our income tax returns like those of most companies are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified we adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

although we believe that our estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

companyowned stores and direct channels 

while our recognition of revenue does not involve significant judgment revenue recognition represents an important accounting policy for our organization we recognize revenue upon customer receipt of the merchandise we also provide a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on prior experience for direct channel revenues we estimate shipments that have not been received by the customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times 

all of our brands sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers in retail stores through our direct channels and through third parties we do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards we recognize income from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer in addition we recognize income on unredeemed gift cards when we can determine that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions gift card breakage we determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns gift card breakage is included in net sales in our consolidated statements of income 

royalty and other 

we also recognize revenues associated with franchise license and wholesale arrangements revenue recognized under franchise and license arrangements generally consists of royalties earned and recognized upon sale of merchandise by franchise and license partners to retail customers revenue is generally recognized under wholesale arrangements at the time the title passes to the partner 

 50 

we recognize revenue associated with merchandise sourcing and production services provided to third parties revenue is recognized at the time the title passes to the customer 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates we use derivative financial instruments like crosscurrency swaps forward contracts and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

foreign exchange rate risk 

we have operations in foreign countries which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to mitigate the translation risk to our earnings and the fair value of our canadian operations associated with fluctuations in the us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate we entered into a series of crosscurrency swaps related to canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans these crosscurrency swaps require the periodic exchange of fixed rate canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate us dollar interest payments as well as exchange of canadian dollar and us dollar principal payments upon maturity the remaining swap arrangements mature in january 2016 and january 2018 at the same time as the related loans as a result of the canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans and the related crosscurrency swaps we do not believe there is any material translation risk to our canadian net earnings associated with fluctuations in the us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate 

in addition our canadian dollar and british pound denominated earnings are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all of our merchandise sold in canada and the uk is sourced through us dollar transactions although we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset these risks these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the shortterm impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally may not be effective in offsetting the longterm impact of sustained shifts in foreign currency rates 

further although our royalty arrangements with our international partners are denominated in us dollars the royalties we receive in us dollars are calculated based on sales in the local currency as a result our royalties in these arrangements are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

interest rate risk 

our investment portfolio primarily consists of interestbearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which specifies permitted types of investments specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer the primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of principal the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk currently our investment portfolio is comprised of us government obligations us treasury and aaarated money market funds highly rated commercial paper and bank deposits given the shortterm nature and quality of investments in our portfolio we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates 

all of our longterm debt as of january 31 2015  has fixed interest rates we will from time to time adjust our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap arrangements as of january 31 2015  we have interest rate swap arrangements with notional amounts of 300 million related to a portion of our 2017 notes and 300 million related to a portion of our 2019 notes 

the effect of the interest rate swap arrangements is to convert the respective amount of debt from a fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate the variable interest rate associated with these swap arrangements fluctuates based on changes in the threemonth libor 

for the balance of our longterm debt that is not subject to interest rate swap arrangements our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows 

fair value of financial instruments 

as of january 31 2015  management believes that the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents receivables and payables approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments 

 51 

the following table provides a summary of the carrying value and fair value of longterm debt and swap arrangements as of january 31 2015  and february 1 2014  

  



 

 concentration of credit risk 

we maintain cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions we monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity we also periodically review the relative credit standing of franchise license and wholesale partners and other entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business

 item 1a risk factors 

we caution that any forwardlooking statements as such term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 contained in this report or made by our company or our management involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors many of which are beyond our control accordingly our future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forwardlooking statements words such as “estimate” “project” “plan” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “planned” “potential” and any similar expressions may identify forwardlooking statements risks associated with the following factors among others in some cases have affected and in the future could affect our financial performance and actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forwardlooking statements included in this report or otherwise made by our company or our management 

  6 

 we are not under any obligation and do not intend to make publicly available any update or other revisions to any of the forwardlooking statements contained in this report to reflect circumstances existing after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of future events even if experience or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by those forwardlooking statements will not be realized 

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10k other filings or in any other discussions of our business the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and item 8  financial statements and supplementary data 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results the risks described below are not our only risks additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business operating results andor financial condition in a material way 

our net sales profit results and cash flow are sensitive to and may be adversely affected by general economic conditions consumer confidence spending patterns and weather or other market disruptions 

our net sales profit cash flows and future growth may be adversely affected by negative local regional national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers’ ability or willingness to spend including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war terrorism or the threat thereof in addition market disruptions due to severe weather conditions natural disasters health hazards or other major events or the prospect of these events could also impact consumer spending and confidence levels in particular our operating results are impacted by factors in the us canadian and uk economies purchases of women’s intimate and other apparel beauty and personal care products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak in such circumstances we may increase the number of promotional sales which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located particularly in markets where we have multiple stores could adversely affect our business for example heavy snowfall rainfall or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period might make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and thereby reduce our sales and profitability our business is also susceptible to unseasonable weather conditions for example extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions reduced sales from extreme or prolonged unseasonable weather conditions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our net sales operating income cash and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis 

we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

seasonal fluctuations also affect our cash and inventory levels since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases we must carry a significant amount of inventory especially before the holiday season selling period if we are not successful in selling inventory we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space 

most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers sales at these stores are derived in part from the volume of traffic in those retail areas our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area including “destination” retail stores to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area competition from other retail and nonretail attractions and other retail areas where we do not have stores 

 7 

part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel and the integration of new stores into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our plans for international expansion include risks that could adversely impact our results and reputation 

we intend to further expand into international markets through license and franchise agreements andor companyowned stores the risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market further entry into other markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence other risks include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets disruptions or delays in shipments changes in diplomatic and trade relationships political instability and foreign governmental regulation 

we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners as licensees franchisees or in a similar capacity in addition certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store openings and sales we cannot ensure the profitability or success of our expansion into international markets 

in addition our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our licensees franchisees and wholesalers could take actions that could harm our business or brand images 

we have global representation through independently owned stores operated by licensees franchisees and wholesalers “partners” although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective partners the level of control we can exercise over our partners is limited and the quality and success of their operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control our partners may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel our brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our partners do not operate successfully these risks could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our direct channel businesses includes risks that could have an adverse effect on our results 

our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results risks include but are not limited to the difficulty in recreating the instore experience through our direct channels domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it overseas outside our control the maintenance and security of the internet infrastructure the failure of and risks related to the systems that operate our websites and the related support systems including computer viruses theft of customer information privacy concerns telecommunication failures and electronic breakins and similar disruptions and risks related to the fulfillment of directtoconsumer orders such as not adequately predicting customer demand or otherwise failing to maintain efficient and uninterrupted ordertaking and fulfillment operations any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 8 

our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand images 

our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise failure to comply with ethical social product labor and environmental standards or related political considerations could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions including boycotts failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

our failure to adequately protect our trade names trademarks and patents could have a negative impact on our brand images and limit our ability to penetrate new markets 

we believe that our trade names trademarks and patents are important assets and an essential element of our strategy we have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names trademarks and patents and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries there can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others if any thirdparty copies our products or our stores in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation it could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our inability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could negatively impact our results 

the sale of women’s intimate and other apparel personal care products and accessories is highly competitive we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers including individual and chain specialty stores department stores and discount retailers in addition to the traditional storebased retailers we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through online channels brand image marketing design price service quality image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the storebased and online channels 

some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing and other resources available in many cases our competitors sell their products in stores that are located in the same shopping malls as our stores in addition to competing for sales we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls 

increased competition could result in price reductions increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our inability to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could negatively impact the image and relevance of our brands 

our success depends in part on management’s ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate saleable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly if we are unable to successfully anticipate identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines our sales will be lower potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory in response we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be adversely impacted by our inability to adequately source distribute and sell merchandise and other materials on a global basis 

we source merchandise and other materials directly in international markets and in our domestic market we distribute merchandise and other materials globally to our partners in international locations and to our stores many of our imports and exports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements including existing or potential duties tariffs or safeguard quotas we compete with other companies for production facilities 

we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business on a global basis such as 

  9 

 new initiatives may be proposed impacting the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions which if enacted could impact our trading relationships with vendors or other parties in such countries 

in addition significant health hazards environmental hazards or natural disasters may occur which could have a negative effect on the economies financial markets and business activity of international markets 

our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales profits assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar although we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency risks these measures may not succeed in offsetting all of the shortterm negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations hedging would generally not be effective in offsetting the longterm impact of sustained shifts in foreign exchange rates on our business results as a result the fluctuation in the value of the us dollar against other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our stock price may be volatile 

our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry in addition the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 

our failure to maintain our credit rating could negatively affect our ability to access capital and could increase our interest expense 

the credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings a deterioration in our capital structure or the quality and stability of our earnings could result in a downgrade of our credit rating any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive if our ability to access capital becomes constrained our interest costs will likely increase which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows additionally changes to our credit rating could affect our interest costs 

we may be unable to service or refinance our debt 

some of our debt agreements contain covenants which require maintenance of certain financial ratios and also under certain conditions restrict our ability to pay dividends repurchase common shares and make other restricted payments as defined in those agreements our cash flow from operations provides the primary source of funds for our debt service payments if our cash flow from operations declines we may be unable to service or refinance our current debt 

we may be unable to retain key personnel 

we believe we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives including leslie h wexner chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit train and retain other qualified key personnel 

 10 

we may be unable to attract develop and retain qualified employees and manage laborrelated costs 

we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer which requires us to have highly trained and engaged employees our success depends in part upon our ability to attract develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including store personnel and talented merchants the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas competition for such qualified individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand delayed store openings significant increases in employee turnover rates or significant increases in laborrelated costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner and meet quality standards 

we purchase products through contract manufacturers and importers and directly from thirdparty manufacturers factors outside our control such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales cancellation charges or excessive markdowns in addition quality problems could result in a product liability judgment or a widespread product recall that may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability competition reaction and consumer attitudes even if the product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertions could adversely impact our reputation with existing and potential customers and our brand image these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in product input costs 

product input costs including manufacturing labor and raw materials fluctuate these fluctuations may result in an increase in our production costs we may not be able to or may elect not to pass these increases on to our customers which may adversely impact our profit margins these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in energy costs 

energy costs have fluctuated dramatically in the past these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase products from our manufacturers a continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be adversely impacted by increases in costs of mailing paper and printing 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and catalogue and promotional mailings we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to recover these costs or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing mailing delivery and order fulfillment systems these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we selfinsure certain risks and may be adversely impacted by unfavorable claims experience 

we are selfinsured for various types of insurable risks including associate medical benefits workers’ compensation property general liability and automobile up to certain stoploss limits claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile any adverse claims experience could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems and to protect associated data 

our success depends in part on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems our information technology systems as well as those of our service providers are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources including telecommunication failures malicious human acts and natural disasters moreover despite network security measures some of our servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses and similar disruptive problems additionally these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer merchandise financial or other important information which could result in damage to our reputation andor litigation the increased use of smartphones tablets and other mobile devices may also heighten these and other operational 

 11 

risks despite the precautions we have taken unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores or impact our consumers ability to access our websites in a timely manner or expose confidential customer merchandise financial or other important information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition we will make modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for pointofsale ecommerce merchandising planning sourcing logistics inventory management and support systems including human resources and finance modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems including accurately capturing data and system disruptions information technology system disruptions if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our failure to maintain the security of customer associate supplier or company information could have a negative impact on our reputation and our results 

information systems are susceptible to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks any significant compromise or breach of our data security could significantly damage our reputation cause the disclosure of confidential customer associate supplier or company information cause our customers to stop shopping with us and result in significant legal regulatory and financial liabilities and lost revenues while we have implemented systems and processes to protect against unauthorized access to secured data and prevent data loss there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may fail to comply with regulatory requirements 

we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements our policies procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable foreign and domestic laws and regulations including those required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the foreign corrupt practices act the sec and the new york stock exchange the “nyse” failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our reputation market price of our common stock results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be adversely impacted by changes in taxation requirements 

we are subject to income tax in local national and international jurisdictions in addition our products are subject to import and excise duties andor sales or valueadded taxes in many jurisdictions the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies the company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations fluctuations in tax rates and duties changes in tax legislation or regulation or adverse outcomes of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

we incurred fees related to the amendment of the revolving facility of 7 million  which were capitalized and are being amortized over the remaining term of the revolving facility 

the revolving facility contains fixed charge coverage and debt to ebitda financial covenants we are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 175  to 100  and a consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda ratio not exceeding 400  to 100  for the most recent fourquarter period in addition the revolving facility provides that investments and restricted payments may be made without limitation on amount if a at the time of and after giving effect to such investment or restricted payment the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda for the most recent fourquarter period is less than 300  to 100  and b no default or event of default exists as of february 1 2014  we were in compliance with both of our financial covenants and the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda was less than 300  to 100

fair value interest rate swap arrangements 

in 2013 we entered into interest rate swap arrangements related to 200 million  of the outstanding 2017 notes 

and 200 million  of the outstanding 2019 notes the interest rate swap arrangements effectively convert the fixed interest rate on the related debt to a variable interest rate based on libor plus a fixed percentage 

the swap arrangements are designated as fair value hedges the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps have an equal and offsetting impact to the carrying value of the debt on the balance sheet the differential to be paid or received on the interest rate swap arrangements is accrued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 

in august 2011 we terminated interest rate swaps related to the 2014 notes with a notional amount of 213 million  in settlement of these swaps we received 9 million

off balance sheet arrangements 

we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined by regulation 229303 item 303 a 4 

impact of inflation 

while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required we believe the effects of inflation if any on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements on an ongoing basis management evaluates its accounting policies estimates and judgments including those related to inventories longlived assets claims and contingencies income taxes and revenue recognition management bases our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position 

inventories 

inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or market on a weightedaverage cost basis 

we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of inventory on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

we also record inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory these estimates are based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends 

 47 

management believes that the assumptions used in these estimates are reasonable and appropriate a 10 increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 2 million  for 2013  a 10 increase or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 2 million  for 2013  

valuation of longlived assets 

property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than the carrying value we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset when a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we concluded that the continued negative operating results of the henri bendel business were an indicator of potential impairment of the henri bendel longlived store assets we calculated the impairment by comparing the estimated discounted cash flows at each store to its respective carrying value and recognized an impairment charge of 27 million this impairment charge is included in cost of goods sold buying  occupancy on the 2012 consolidated statement of income based on the evaluation performed in the fourth quarter of 2013 we concluded that no impairment charge was necessary in 2013 the remaining carrying value of the henri bendel longlived stores assets was 5 million and 6 million as of february 1 2014 and february 2 2013 respectively 

goodwill is reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change first pursuant to accounting standards update asu 201108 testing goodwill for impairment  we perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that each reporting units fair value is less than its carrying value including goodwill if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value we then estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities of that reporting unit including the implied fair value of goodwill through either estimated discounted future cash flows or marketbased methodologies if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference our reporting units are determined in accordance with the provisions of asc topic 350 intangibles  goodwill and other  our reporting units that have goodwill are victorias secret stores victorias secret direct and bath  body works 

the carrying value of goodwill for la senza was reduced to zero as of february 2 2013 due to impairments of 189 million 119 million and 12 million in 2008 2011 and 2012 respectively for additional information see note 7  to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplemental data 

intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change pursuant to asu 201202 testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment  we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount we estimate the fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset compare that value with its carrying amount and record an impairment charge if any 

the carrying value of trade names for la senza was reduced to zero as of february 2 2013 due to impairments of 26 million 3 million 113 million and 81 million in 2008 2009 2011 and 2012 respectively for additional information see note 7  to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplemental data 

we estimate the fair value of property and equipment goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of asc topic 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  if future economic conditions are different than those projected by management future impairment charges may be required 

 48 

claims and contingencies 

we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits insurance regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business our determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the consolidated financial statements is based on management’s view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency we consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seek input from both internal and external experts within and outside our organization with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business we accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible as opposed to probable or if an estimate is not reasonably determinable disclosure of a material claim or contingency is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our consolidated statement of income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized us deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed income of foreign subsidiaries where such earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested for the foreseeable future 

significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities in determining our provision for income taxes we use an annual effective income tax rate based on annual income permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates we adjust the annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available our effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings 

we follow the authoritative guidance included in asc topic 740 income taxes  which contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 

our income tax returns like those of most companies are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified we adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

although we believe that our estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

companyowned stores and direct channels 

while our recognition of revenue does not involve significant judgment revenue recognition represents an important accounting policy for our organization we recognize revenue upon customer receipt of the merchandise we also provide a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on prior experience for direct channel revenues we estimate shipments that have not been received by the customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times 

 49 

all of our brands sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers in retail stores through our direct channels and through third parties we do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards we recognize income from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer in addition we recognize income on unredeemed gift cards when we can determine that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions gift card breakage we determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns gift card breakage is included in net sales in our consolidated statements of income 

franchise and other 

we also recognize revenues associated with franchise and wholesale arrangements revenue recognized under franchise arrangements generally consists of royalties earned upon sale of merchandise by franchisees to thirdparty customers revenue is generally recognized under wholesale arrangements at the time the title passes to the customer 

we recognize revenue associated with merchandise sourcing and production services provided to third parties revenue is recognized at the time the title passes to the customer 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates we use derivative financial instruments like the crosscurrency swaps forward contracts and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

foreign exchange rate risk 

we have operations in foreign countries which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to mitigate the translation risk to our earnings and the fair value of our canadian operations associated with fluctuations in the us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate we entered into a series of crosscurrency swaps related to canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans these crosscurrency swaps require the periodic exchange of fixed rate canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate us dollar interest payments as well as exchange of canadian dollar and us dollar principal payments upon maturity the swap arrangements mature between 2015 and 2018 at the same time as the related loans as a result of the canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans and the related crosscurrency swaps we do not believe there is any material translation risk to our canadian net earnings associated with fluctuations in the us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate 

in addition our canadian dollar and british pound denominated earnings are subject to exchange rate risk as substantially all of our merchandise sold in canada and the uk is sourced through us dollar transactions we utilize foreign currency forward contracts to partially offset these risks 

interest rate risk 

our investment portfolio primarily consists of interestbearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which specifies permitted types of investments specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer the primary objective of our investment activities are the preservation of principal the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk currently our investment portfolio is comprised of us government obligations us treasury and aaarated money market funds highlyrated commercial paper and bank deposits given the shortterm nature and quality of investments in our portfolio we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates 

all of our longterm debt as of february 1 2014  has fixed interest rates we will from time to time adjust our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap arrangements as of february 1 2014  we have interest rate swap arrangements with notional amounts of 200 million related to a portion of our 2017 notes and 200 million related to a portion of our 2019 notes 

the effect of the interest rate swap arrangements is to convert the respective amount of debt from a fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate the variable interest rate associated with these swap arrangements fluctuates based on changes in the threemonth london interbank offered rate libor 

 50 

for the balance of our longterm debt that is not subject to interest rate swap arrangements our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows 

fair value of financial instruments 

as of february 1 2014  management believes that the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents receivables and payables approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments 

the following table provides a summary of the carrying value and fair value of longterm debt and swap arrangements as of february 1 2014  and february 2 2013  

  



 

 concentration of credit risk 

we maintain cash and cash equivalents and derivative contracts with various major financial institutions we monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity we also periodically review the relative credit standing of franchise license and wholesale partners and other entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business

 item 1a risk factors 

we caution that any forwardlooking statements as such term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 contained in this report or made by our company or our management involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors many of which are beyond our control accordingly our future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forwardlooking statements words such as “estimate” “project” “plan” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “planned” “potential” and any similar expressions may identify forwardlooking statements risks associated with the following factors among others in some cases have affected and in the future could affect our financial performance and actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forwardlooking statements included in this report or otherwise made by our company or our management 

  6 

 we are not under any obligation and do not intend to make publicly available any update or other revisions to any of the forwardlooking statements contained in this report to reflect circumstances existing after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of future events even if experience or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by those forwardlooking statements will not be realized 

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10k other filings or in any other discussions of our business the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and item 8  financial statements and supplementary data 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results the risks described below are not our only risks additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business operating results andor financial condition in a material way 

our net sales profit results and cash flow are sensitive to and may be adversely affected by general economic conditions consumer confidence spending patterns and market disruptions 

our net sales profit cash flows and future growth may be adversely affected by negative local regional national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers’ ability or willingness to spend including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war terrorism or the threat thereof in addition market disruptions due to severe weather conditions natural disasters health hazards or other major events or the prospect of these events could also impact consumer spending and confidence levels in particular our operating results are impacted by factors in the us canadian and uk economies purchases of women’s intimate and other apparel beauty and personal care products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak in such circumstances we may increase the number of promotional sales which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our net sales operating income cash and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis 

we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

seasonal fluctuations also affect our cash and inventory levels since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases we must carry a significant amount of inventory especially before the holiday season selling period if we are not successful in selling inventory we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space 

most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers sales at these stores are derived in part from the volume of traffic in those retail areas our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area including “destination” retail stores to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area competition from other retail and nonretail attractions and other retail areas where we do not have stores 

part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 7 

our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel particularly at the store management level and the integration of new stores into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our plans for international expansion include risks that could adversely impact our results and reputation 

we intend to further expand into international markets through license and franchise agreements andor companyowned stores the risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market further entry into other markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence other risks include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets disruptions or delays in shipments changes in diplomatic and trade relationships political instability and foreign governmental regulation 

we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners as licensees franchisees or in a similar capacity in addition certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store openings and sales we cannot ensure the profitability or success of our expansion into international markets 

in addition our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates more specifically an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our earnings and our financial condition 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our licensees and franchisees could take actions that could harm our business or brand images 

we have global representation through independently owned stores operated by licensees and franchisees “partners” although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective partners the level of control we can exercise over our partners is limited and the quality and success of their operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control our partners may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel our brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our partners do not operate successfully these risks could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our direct channel businesses includes risks that could have an adverse effect on our results 

our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results risks include but are not limited to the a diversion of sales from our stores which may impact comparable store sales figures b difficulty in recreating the instore experience through our direct channels c domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it overseas outside our control d the failure of and risks related to the systems that operate the websites and their related support systems including computer viruses theft of customer information privacy concerns telecommunication failures and electronic breakins and similar disruptions and e risks related to the fulfillment of directtoconsumer orders any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand images 

our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise failure to comply with ethical social product labor and environmental standards or related political considerations could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions including boycotts failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

 8 

our failure to adequately protect our trade names trademarks and patents could have a negative impact on our brand images and limit our ability to penetrate new markets 

we believe that our trade names trademarks and patents are important assets and an essential element of our strategy we have obtained or app lied for federal registration of these trade names trademarks and patents and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries there can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others if any thirdparty copies our products in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation it could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our inability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could negatively impact our results 

the sale of women’s intimate and other apparel personal care products and accessories is highly competitive we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers including individual and chain specialty stores department stores and discount retailers in addition to the traditional storebased retailers we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through direct response channels brand image marketing design price service quality image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the storebased and direct response channels 

some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing and other resources available in many cases our competitors sell their products in stores that are located in the same shopping malls as our stores in addition to competing for sales we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls 

increased competition could result in price reductions increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our inability to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could negatively impact the image and relevance of our brands 

our success depends in part on management’s ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate saleable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly if we are unable to successfully anticipate identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines our sales will be lower potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory in response we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be adversely impacted by our inability to adequately source distribute and sell merchandise and other materials on a global basis 

we source merchandise and other materials directly in international markets and in our domestic market we distribute merchandise and other materials globally to our partners in international locations and to our stores many of our imports and exports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements including existing or potential duties tariffs or safeguard quotas we compete with other companies for production facilities 

we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business on a global basis such as 

  9 

new initiatives may be proposed impacting the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions which if enacted could impact our trading relationships with vendors or other parties in such countries 

in addition significant health hazards environmental hazards or natural disasters may occur which could have a negative effect on the economies financial markets and business activity of international markets 

our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our stock price may be volatile 

our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of quarter to quarter variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry in addition the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 

our failure to maintain our credit rating could negatively affect our ability to access capital and could increase our interest expense 

the credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings a deterioration in our capital structure or the quality and stability of our earnings could result in a downgrade of our credit rating any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive if our ability to access capital becomes constrained our interest costs will likely increase which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows additionally changes to our credit rating could affect our interest costs 

we may be unable to service or refinance our debt 

some of our debt agreements contain covenants which require maintenance of certain financial ratios and also under certain conditions restrict our ability to pay dividends repurchase common shares and make other restricted payments as defined in those agreements our cash flow from operations provides the primary source of funds for our debt service payments if our cash flow from operations declines we may be unable to service or refinance our current debt 

we may be unable to retain key personnel 

we believe we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives including leslie h wexner chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit train and retain other qualified key personnel 

we may be unable to attract develop and retain qualified employees and manage labor costs 

we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer which requires us to have highly trained and engaged employees our success depends in part upon our ability to attract develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including store personnel and talented merchants the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas competition for such qualified individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand delayed store openings significant increases in employee turnover rates or significant increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner and meet quality standards 

we purchase products through contract manufacturers and importers and directly from thirdparty manufacturers factors outside our control such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales cancellation charges or excessive markdowns in addition quality problems could result in a product liability judgment or a widespread product recall that may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability competition reaction and consumer attitudes even if the product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertions could adversely impact our reputation 

 10 

with existing and potential customers and our brand image these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in product input costs 

product input costs including manufacturing labor and raw materials fluctuate these fluctuations may result in an increase in our production costs we may not be able to or may elect not to pass these increases on to our customers which may adversely impact our profit margins these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in energy costs 

energy costs have fluctuated dramatically in the past these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase products from our manufacturers a continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be adversely impacted by increases in costs of mailing paper and printing 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and catalogue and promotional mailings we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to recover these costs or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing mailing delivery and order fulfillment systems these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we selfinsure certain risks and may be adversely impacted by unfavorable claims experience 

we are selfinsured for various types of insurable risks including associate medical benefits workers’ compensation property general liability and automobile up to certain stoploss limits claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile any adverse claims experience could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems and to protect associated data 

our success depends in part on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems our information technology systems as well as those of our service providers are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources including telecommunication failures malicious human acts and natural disasters moreover despite network security measures some of our servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses and similar disruptive problems additionally these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer merchandise financial or other important information which could result in damage to our reputation andor litigation despite the precautions we have taken unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores or impact our consumers ability to access our websites in a timely manner or expose confidential customer merchandise financial or other important information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition we will make modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for pointofsale ecommerce merchandising planning sourcing logistics inventory management and support systems including human resources and finance modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems including accurately capturing data and system disruptions information technology system disruptions if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

we may fail to comply with regulatory requirements 

we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements our policies procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable foreign and domestic laws and regulations including those required by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the foreign corrupt practices act the sec and the new york stock exchange the “nyse” failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our reputation market price of our common stock results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

 11 

we may be adversely impacted by changes in taxation requirements 

we are subject to income tax in local national and international jurisdictions in addition our products are subject to import and excise duties andor sales or valueadded taxes in many jurisdictions fluctuations in tax rates and duties and changes in tax legislation or regulation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be adversely impacted by certain compliance or legal matters 

we along with our thirdparty business partners are subject to complex compliance and litigation risks actions filed against our company from time to time include commercial tort intellectual property customer employment data privacy securities anticorruption and other claims including purported class action lawsuits difficulty can exist in complying with sometimes conflicting regulations in local national or foreign jurisdictions as well as new or changing regulations that affect how we operate in addition we may be impacted by litigation trends including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation market price of our common stock results of operations financial condition and cash flows

liquidity or access to cash is an important factor in determining our financial stability we are committed to maintaining adequate liquidity cash generated from our operating activities provides the primary resources to support current operations growth initiatives seasonal funding requirements and capital expenditures our cash provided from operations is impacted by our net income and working capital changes our net income is impacted by among other things sales volume seasonal sales patterns success of new product introductions and profit margins historically sales are higher during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to seasonal and holidayrelated sales patterns generally our need for working capital peaks during the summer and fall months as inventory builds in anticipation of the holiday period 

we believe in returning value to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchase programs during 2012  we paid 1449 billion  in regular and special dividends and repurchased 625 million  of our common stock we use cash flow generated from operating activities as well as cash flow generated from financing activities to fund our dividends and share repurchase programs 

our total cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were 351 million as of february 2 2013  under current tax laws and regulations if cash and cash equivalents held outside the us are repatriated to the us in certain circumstances we may be subject to additional us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes

revolving facility 

on july 15 2011 we entered into an amendment and restatement “amendment” of our secured revolving credit facility “revolving facility” the amendment increased the aggregate amount of the commitments of the lenders under the revolving facility to 1 billion  and extended the termination date to july 15 2016 in addition the amendment reduced fees payable under the revolving facility which are based on our longterm credit ratings the fees related to committed and unutilized amounts per year are 0325  per annum and the fees related to outstanding letters of credit are 175  per annum in addition the interest rate on outstanding borrowings is london interbank offered rate “libor” plus 175  

we incurred fees related to the amendment of the revolving facility of 7 million  which were capitalized and are being amortized over the remaining term of the revolving facility 

the revolving facility contains fixed charge coverage and debt to ebitda financial covenants we are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 175  to 100  and a consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda ratio not exceeding 400  to 100  for the most recent fourquarter period in addition the revolving facility provides that investments and restricted payments may be made without limitation on amount if a at the time of and after giving effect to such investment or restricted payment the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda for the most recent fourquarter period is less than 300  to 100  and b no default or event of default exists as of february 2 2013  we were in compliance with both of our financial covenants and the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda was less than 300  to 100

fair value interest rate swap arrangements 

we had interest rate swap arrangements related to the 2017 notes with a notional amount of 175 million  as of january 28 2012  the interest rate swap arrangements effectively converted the fixed interest rate on the related debt to a variable interest rate based on a libor plus a fixed interest rate 

the swap arrangements were designated as fair value hedges the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps had an equal and offsetting impact to the carrying value of the debt on the balance sheet the differential to be paid or received on the interest rate swap arrangements was accrued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 

 40 

in august 2011 we terminated interest rate designated fair value hedges related to the 2014 notes with a notional amount of 213 million in settlement of these hedges we received 9 million the carrying value of the 2014 notes includes 5 million of unamortized hedge settlements at february 2 2013  which are amortized as a reduction to interest expense through the maturity date of the 2014 notes

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

indefinitelived intangible assets 

in july 2012 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201202 testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment asu 201202 which gives companies the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if a company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an asset exceeds its carrying amount it would not need to calculate the fair value of the asset in that year however if a company concludes otherwise it must calculate the fair value of the asset compare that value with its carrying amount and record an impairment charge if any this guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal 2013 however early adoption is permitted we adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2012 asu 201202 did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

accumulated other comprehensive income 

in february 2013 the fasb issued asu 201302  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  which amends asc 220 comprehensive income  this guidance requires companies to disclose in one place information about reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci for significant items reclassified out of aoci to net income in their entirety in the same reporting period reporting either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes is required about the effect of the reclassifications on the respective line items in the statement where net income is presented for items that are not reclassified to net income in their entirety in the same period a cross reference to other disclosures currently required under gaap is required in the notes this guidance is required to be adopted in fiscal year 2013 however early adoption is permitted asu 201302 will not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows we are currently evaluating the provisions of this asu 

impact of inflation 

while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required we believe the effects of inflation if any on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor 

 46 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements on an ongoing basis management evaluates its accounting policies estimates and judgments including those related to inventories longlived assets claims and contingencies income taxes and revenue recognition management bases our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position 

inventories 

inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or market on a weightedaverage cost basis 

we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of inventory on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

we also record inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory these estimates are based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends 

management believes that the assumptions used in these estimates are reasonable and appropriate a 10 increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 2 million  for 2012  a 10 increase or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 2 million  for 2012  

valuation of longlived assets 

property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than the carrying value we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset when a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life 

goodwill is reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change first pursuant to asu 201108 testing goodwill for impairment  we perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that each reporting units fair value is less than its carrying value including goodwill if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value we then estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities of that reporting unit including the implied fair value of goodwill through either estimated discounted future cash flows or marketbased methodologies if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference our reporting units are determined in accordance with the provisions of asc topic 350 intangibles  goodwill and other  our reporting units that have goodwill are victorias secret stores victorias secret direct bath  body works and la senza 

intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change pursuant to asu 201202 testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment  we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount we estimate the fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset compare that value with its carrying amount and record an impairment charge if any 

we estimate the fair value of property and equipment goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of asc topic 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  if future economic conditions are different than those projected by management future impairment charges may be required 

 47 

la senza goodwill and other intangible assets 

in conjunction with the january 2007 acquisition of la senza we recognized goodwill trade name and other intangible assets these assets are included in the la senza reporting unit which is part of other in our segment reporting we have identified the la senza operating segment as a reporting unit for the goodwill impairment test in accordance with the provisions of asc 350 as of february 2 2013  the carrying value of goodwill and trade names for la senza has been reduced to zero 

in the latter half of 2008 la senza was negatively impacted by the global economic downturn and the resulting impact on the canadian retail environment as well as other factors as a result la senzas operating results deteriorated significantly particularly when compared to our expectations at the time of acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2008 we concluded that the goodwill and certain trade name assets related to the la senza acquisition were impaired and recorded impairment charges of 189 million and 26 million related to the goodwill and trade name assets respectively 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we concluded that certain trade names would no longer be utilized within the la senza business as a result we recorded an impairment charge of 3 million  

no impairment charges were recorded related to la senza goodwill and intangible assets 

during 2011 la senzas operating results failed to meet our expectations as both comparable store sales and gross profit were below our beginning of year expectations especially in the critical fourth quarter holiday period in the fourth quarter of 2011 we concluded that the goodwill and certain other intangible assets related to la senza were impaired and recorded impairment charges of 119 million and 113 million related to the goodwill and other intangible assets respectively these impairment charges are included in impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on the 2011 consolidated statement of income 

during 2012 la senzas operating results again failed to meet our expectations as both comparable store sales and gross profit were below our beginning of year expectations in the fourth quarter of 2012 we concluded that the goodwill and certain other intangible assets related to la senza were fully impaired and recorded impairment charges of 12 million and 81 million related to the goodwill and other intangible assets respectively these impairment charges reduced the carrying value of these assets to zero and are included in impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on the 2012 consolidated statement of income 

impairment testing methodology—goodwill 

we evaluated la senza’s goodwill by comparing the carrying value of the la senza reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit determined through estimated discounted future cash flows we corroborated the estimated fair value of the la senza reporting unit as determined by our discounted cash flow approach by referencing a marketbased methodology 

our 2010 evaluation indicated that the estimated fair value of the la senza reporting unit was in excess of the carrying value as a result we were not required to calculate the implied value of goodwill and no impairment was recognized 

2011 and 2012 

based on our 2011 and 2012 evaluations the carrying value of the la senza reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value as a result we measured the goodwill impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the implied value of the goodwill based on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit considering the estimated fair value of all assets and liabilities 

impairment testing methodology—other intangible assets 

we evaluated the la senza trade name and other intangible assets by comparing the carrying values to the estimated fair values determined using a relief from royalty and other discounted cash flow methodologies 

 48 

based on our 2010 evaluation the estimated fair value of the la senza trade name exceeded the carrying value reasonable changes in the significant estimates and assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value would not have resulted in a trade name impairment 

based on our 2011 evaluation the carrying value of the la senza trade name exceeded its estimated fair value as a result we recognized an impairment charge of 112 million to reduce the trade name carrying value to estimated fair value additionally we recognized an additional impairment charge of 1 million related to certain leaserelated intangible assets 

based on our 2012 evaluation the la senza trade name was fully impaired as a result we recognized an impairment charge of 75 million to reduce the trade name carrying value to zero additionally we recognized an additional impairment charge of 6 million related to certain finitelived customer relationship intangible assets 

significant estimates and assumptions 

our determination of the estimated fair value of the la senza reporting unit and other intangible assets requires significant judgments about economic factors industry factors our views regarding the future prospects of the la senza reporting unit as well as numerous estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective the estimates and assumptions critical to the overall fair value estimates include i estimated future cash flow generated by la senza ii the terminal value assumption used in the discounted cash flow methodologies and iii the royalty rate assumption used in the relief from royalty valuation methodology these and other estimates and assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and expectations of management and may change in the future based on periodspecific facts and circumstances 

sensitivity analysis 

the following provides sensitivities to our 2012  significant estimates and assumptions as noted above 

 other impairment 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 we concluded that a subbrand trade name would no longer be utilized within the victoria’s secret business we compared the estimated fair value of the trade name using a relief from royalty methodology to the carrying value and concluded that the trade name was fully impaired as a result we recognized an impairment charge of 6 million  this impairment charge is included in impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on the 2010 consolidated statement of income 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we concluded that the continued negative operating results of the henri bendel business were an indicator of potential impairment of the henri bendel longlived store assets we calculated the impairment by comparing the estimated discounted cash flows at the individual store level to its respective carrying value and recognized an impairment charge of 27 million this impairment charge is included in cost of goods sold buying  occupancy on the 2012 consolidated statement of income 

claims and contingencies 

we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits insurance regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business our determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the consolidated financial statements is based on management’s view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency we consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seek input from both internal and external experts within and outside our organization with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business we accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible as opposed to probable or if an estimate is not reasonably determinable disclosure of a material claim or contingency is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data 

 49 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our consolidated statement of income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 

significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities in determining our provision for income taxes we use an annual effective income tax rate based on annual income permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates we adjust the annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available our effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings 

we follow the authoritative guidance included in asc topic 740 income taxes  which contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 

our income tax returns like those of most companies are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified we adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

although we believe that our estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

companyowned stores and direct channels 

while our recognition of revenue does not involve significant judgment revenue recognition represents an important accounting policy for our organization we recognize revenue upon customer receipt of the merchandise we also provide a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on prior experience for direct channel revenues we estimate shipments that have not been received by the customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times 

all of our brands sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers in retail stores through our direct channels and through third parties we do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards we recognize income from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer in addition we recognize income on unredeemed gift cards when we can determine that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions gift card breakage we determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns gift card breakage is included in net sales in our consolidated statements of income 

franchise and other 

we also recognize revenues associated with franchise and wholesale arrangements revenue recognized under franchise arrangements generally consists of royalties earned upon sale of merchandise by franchisees to thirdparty customers revenue is generally recognized under wholesale arrangements at the time the title passes to the customer 

we recognize revenue associated with merchandise sourcing and production services provided to third parties revenue is recognized at the time the title passes to the customer

the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates we use derivative financial instruments like the crosscurrency swaps and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

foreign exchange rate risk 

to mitigate the translation risk to our earnings and the fair value of our canadian operations associated with fluctuations in the us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate we entered into a series of crosscurrency swaps related to canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans these crosscurrency swaps require the periodic exchange of fixed rate canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate us dollar interest payments as well as exchange of canadian dollar and us dollar principal payments upon maturity the swap arrangements mature between 2015 and 2018 at the same time as the related loans as a result of the canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans and the related crosscurrency swaps we do not believe there is any material translation risk to our canadian net earnings associated with fluctuations in the us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate 

in addition our canadian dollar denominated earnings are subject to us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate risk as substantially all of our merchandise sold in canada is sourced through us dollar transactions 

interest rate risk 

our investment portfolio primarily consists of interestbearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which specifies permitted types of investments specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer the primary objective of our investment activities are the preservation of principal the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk currently our investment portfolio is comprised of us and canadian government obligations us treasury and aaarated money market funds bank time deposits and highlyrated commercial paper given the shortterm nature and quality of investments in our portfolio we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates 

all of our longterm debt as of february 2 2013  has fixed interest rates our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows 

we will from time to time adjust our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap arrangements as of february 2 2013  we have no outstanding interest rate swap arrangements related to our longterm debt 

fair value of financial instruments 

as of february 2 2013  management believes that the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents receivables and payables approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments

 item 1a risk factors 

we caution that any forwardlooking statements as such term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 contained in this report or made by our company or our management involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors many of which are beyond our control accordingly our future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forwardlooking statements words such as “estimate” “project” “plan” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “planned” “potential” and any similar expressions may identify forwardlooking statements risks associated with the following factors among others in some cases have affected and in the future could affect our financial performance and actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forwardlooking statements included in this report or otherwise made by our company or our management 

 5 

appropriate terms 

 we are not under any obligation and do not intend to make publicly available any update or other revisions to any of the forwardlooking statements contained in this report to reflect circumstances existing after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of future events even if experience or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by those forwardlooking statements will not be realized 

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10k other filings or in any other discussions of our business the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and item 8  financial statements and supplementary data 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results the risks described below are not our only risks 

additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business operating results andor financial condition in a material way 

our net sales profit results and cash flow are sensitive to and may be adversely affected by general economic conditions consumer confidence spending patterns and market disruptions 

our net sales profit cash flows and future growth may be adversely affected by negative local regional national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers’ ability or willingness to spend including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war terrorism or the threat thereof in addition market disruptions due to severe weather conditions natural disasters health hazards or other major events or the prospect of these events could also impact consumer spending and confidence levels in particular our operating results are impacted by factors in the us and canadian economies purchases of women’s intimate and other apparel beauty and personal care products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak in such circumstances we may increase the number of promotional sales which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our net sales operating income and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis 

we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

seasonal fluctuations also affect our inventory levels since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases we must carry a significant amount of inventory especially before the holiday season selling period if we are not successful in selling inventory we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space 

most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers sales at these stores are derived in part from the volume of traffic in those retail areas our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area including “destination” retail stores to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area competition from other retail and nonretail attractions and other retail areas where we do not have stores 

part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel particularly at the store management level and the integration of new stores into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our plans for international expansion include risks that could adversely impact our results and reputation 

we intend to further expand into international markets through license and franchise agreements andor companyowned stores the risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market further entry into other markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence other risks include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets disruptions or delays in shipments changes in diplomatic and trade relationships political instability and foreign governmental regulation 

we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners as licensees franchisees or in a similar capacity in addition certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store openings and sales we cannot ensure the profitability or success of our expansion into international markets 

in addition our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates more specifically an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our earnings and our financial condition 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our licensees and franchisees could take actions that could harm our business or brand images 

we have global representation through independently owned stores operated by licensees and franchisees “partners” although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective partners the level of control we can exercise over our partners is limited and the quality and success of their operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control our partners may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel our brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our partners do not operate successfully these risks could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our direct channel business includes risks that could have an adverse effect on our results 

our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results risks include but are not limited to the a diversion of sales from our stores which may impact comparable store sales figures b difficulty in recreating the instore experience through our direct channels c domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it overseas outside our control d the failure of and risks related to the systems that operate the websites and their related support systems including computer viruses theft of customer information privacy concerns telecommunication failures and electronic breakins and similar disruptions and e risks related to the fulfillment of directtoconsumer orders any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand images 

our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise failure to comply with ethical social product labor and environmental standards or related political considerations could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions including boycotts failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

our failure to adequately protect our trade names trademarks and patents could have a negative impact on our brand images and limit our ability to penetrate new markets 

we believe that our trade names trademarks and patents are an essential element of our strategy we have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names trademarks and patents and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries there can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others if any thirdparty copies our products in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation it could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our inability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could negatively impact our results 

the sale of women’s intimate and other apparel personal care products and accessories is highly competitive we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers including individual and chain specialty stores department stores and discount retailers in addition to the traditional storebased retailers we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through direct response channels brand image marketing design price service quality image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the storebased and direct response channels 

some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing and other resources available in many cases our competitors sell their products in stores that are located in the same shopping malls as our stores in addition to competing for sales we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls 

increased competition could result in price reductions increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our inability to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could negatively impact the image and relevance of our brands 

our success depends in part on management’s ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate saleable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly if we are unable to successfully anticipate identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines our sales will be lower potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory in response we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we rely significantly on foreign sources of production and maintenance of operations in foreign countries 

we purchase merchandise directly in foreign markets and in our domestic market many of our imports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements including existing or potential duties tariffs or safeguard quotas we compete with other companies for production facilities 

we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad such as 

 new initiatives may be proposed impacting the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions which if enacted would limit or reduce the products purchased from suppliers in such countries 

in addition significant health hazards environmental hazards or natural disasters may occur which could have a negative effect on the economies financial markets and business activity our purchase of merchandise from these manufacturing operations may be affected by this risk 

our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our stock price may be volatile 

our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of quarter to quarter variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry in addition the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 

our failure to maintain our credit rating could negatively affect our ability to access capital and would increase our interest expense 

the credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for 

our operations we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive if our ability to access capital becomes constrained our interest costs will likely increase which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows additionally changes to our credit rating would affect our interest costs 

we may be unable to service our debt 

some of our debt agreements contain covenants which require maintenance of certain financial ratios and also under certain conditions restrict our ability to pay dividends repurchase common shares and make other restricted payments as defined in those agreements our cash flow from operations provides the primary source of funds for our debt service payments if our cash flow from operations declines we may be unable to service or refinance our current debt 

we may be unable to retain key personnel 

we believe we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives including leslie h wexner chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit train and retain other qualified key personnel 

we may be unable to attract develop and retain qualified employees and manage labor costs 

we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer which requires us to have highly trained and engaged employees our success depends in part upon our ability to attract develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including store personnel and talented merchants the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas competition for such qualified individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand delayed store openings significant increases in employee turnover rates or significant increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner and meet quality standards 

we purchase products through contract manufacturers and importers and directly from thirdparty manufacturers factors outside our control such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales cancellation charges or excessive markdowns in addition quality problems could result in a product liability judgment or a widespread product recall that may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability competition reaction and consumer attitudes even if the product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertions could adversely impact our reputation with existing and potential customers and our brand image these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in product input costs

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

other comprehensive income 

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standard update “asu” asu 201105 presentation of comprehensive income  which amends asc 220 comprehensive income  this guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as a part of the statement of shareholders’ equity and requires other comprehensive income to be presented as part of a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in a statement of other comprehensive income immediately following the statement of income while the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income this guidance is required to be adopted in fiscal year 2012 and must be retrospectively applied to all reporting periods presented the fasb has permitted early adoption we adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2011 asu 201105 did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in december 2011 the fasb issued asu 201112 deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asu 201105  which defers the asu 201105 requirement that companies present reclassification adjustments for each component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci in both net income and other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements companies are still required to present reclassifications out of aoci on the face of the financial statements or disclose those amounts in the notes to the financial statements this asu also defers the requirement to report reclassification adjustments in interim periods this guidance is required to be adopted in fiscal year 2012 however early adoption is permitted we adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2011 asu 201112 did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows 

goodwill 

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu 201108 testing goodwill for impairment  which gives companies testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit in step one 

of the goodwill impairment test if companies determine based on qualitative factors that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount the twostep impairment test would be required otherwise further testing would not be needed this guidance will be effective beginning in fiscal year 2012 however early adoption is permitted asu 201108 will not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations financial position or cash flows we are currently evaluating the provisions of this asu 

impact of inflation 

while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required we believe the effects of inflation if any on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements on an ongoing basis management evaluates its accounting policies estimates and judgments including those related to inventories longlived assets claims and contingencies income taxes and revenue recognition management bases our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting  policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position 

inventories 

inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or market on a weightedaverage cost basis 

we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of inventory on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

we also record inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory these estimates are based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends 

management believes that the assumptions used in these estimates are reasonable and appropriate a 10 increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 2 million  for 2011  a 10 increase or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 2 million  for 2011  

valuation of longlived assets 

property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than the carrying value we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset when a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life 

goodwill is reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change the impairment review is performed by comparing each reporting unit’s carrying value to its estimated fair value determined through either estimated discounted future cash flows or marketbased methodologies if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value we determine the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference 

intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change the impairment review is performed by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset 

we estimate the fair value of property and equipment goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of asc topic 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  if future economic conditions are different than those projected by management future impairment charges may be required 

la senza goodwill and other intangible assets 

in conjunction with the january 2007 acquisition of la senza we recorded 313 million  in goodwill and 170 million  in trade name and other intangible assets as of january 28 2012  the carrying value of goodwill and trade names for la senza is 12 million  and 75 million  respectively these assets are included in the la senza reporting unit which is part of the other segment 

in the latter half of 2008 la senza was negatively impacted by the global economic downturn and the resulting impact on the canadian retail environment as a result la senzas operating results deteriorated significantly particularly when compared to our expectations at the time of acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2008 we concluded that the goodwill and certain trade name assets related to the la senza acquisition were impaired and recorded impairment charges of 189 million and 26 million related to the goodwill and trade name assets respectively 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we concluded that certain trade names would no longer be utilized within the la senza business as a result we recorded an impairment charge of 3 million  this impairment charge is included in impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on the 2009 consolidated statement of income 

no impairment charges were recorded related to la senza goodwill and intangible assets 

during 2011 la senzas operating results failed to meet our expectations as both comparable store sales and gross profit were below our beginning of year expectations especially in the critical fourth quarter holiday period in the fourth quarter of 2011 we concluded that the goodwill and certain other intangible assets related to la senza were impaired and recorded impairment charges of 119 million  and 113 million  related to the goodwill and other intangible assets respectively these impairment charges are included in impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on the 2011 consolidated statement of income 

impairment testing—goodwill 

we evaluated la senza’s goodwill by comparing the carrying value of the la senza reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit determined through estimated discounted future cash flows we corroborated the estimated fair value of the la senza reporting unit as determined by our discounted cash flow approach by referencing a marketbased methodology 

2009 and 2010 

our 2009 and 2010 evaluations indicated that the estimated fair value of the la senza reporting unit was in excess of the carrying value as a result we were not required to calculate the implied value of goodwill and no impairment was recognized 

based on our 2011 evaluation the carrying value of the la senza reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value as a result we measured the goodwill impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the implied value of the goodwill based on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit considering the estimated fair value of all assets and liabilities as a result of this analysis we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 119 million  

impairment testing—other intangible assets 

we evaluated the la senza trade name and other intangible assets by comparing the carrying values to the estimated fair values determined using a relief from royalty and other discounted cash flow methodologies 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we made the decision to exit the la senza girl business and recorded an impairment charge of 3 million  related to the la senza girl trade name and other minor subbrands our 2009 evaluation of the overall la senza trade name indicated that the estimated fair value was in excess of the carrying value as a result no impairment was recognized with regards to this asset 

2010 

based on our 2010 evaluation the estimated fair value of the la senza trade name exceeded the carrying value reasonable changes in the significant estimates and assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value would not have resulted in a trade name impairment 

based on our 2011 evaluation the carrying value of the la senza trade name exceeded its estimated fair value as a result we recognized an impairment charge of 112 million  to reduce the trade name carrying value to estimated fair value additionally we recognized an additional impairment charge of 1 million  related to certain leaserelated intangible assets 

significant estimates and assumptions 

our determination of the estimated fair value of the la senza reporting unit and other intangible assets requires significant judgments about economic factors industry factors our views regarding the future prospects of the la senza reporting unit as well as numerous estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective the estimates and assumptions critical to the overall fair value estimates include i estimated future cash flow generated by la senza ii discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair values iii the terminal value assumption used in the discounted cash flow methodologies and iv the royalty rate assumption used in the relief from royalty valuation methodology these and other estimates and assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and expectations of management and may change in the future based on periodspecific facts and circumstances if la senza’s future cash flows are different than those projected by management additional future impairment charges may be required 

sensitivity analysis 

the following provides sensitivities to our 2011  significant estimates and assumptions as noted above 

 other impairment 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 we concluded that a subbrand trade name would no longer be utilized within the victoria’s secret business we compared the estimated fair value of the trade name using a relief from royalty methodology to the carrying value and concluded that the trade name was fully impaired as a result we recognized an impairment charge of 6 million  this impairment charge is included in impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on the 2010 consolidated statement of income 

claims and contingencies 

we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits insurance regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business our determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the consolidated financial statements is based on management’s view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency we consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seek input from both internal and external experts within and outside our organization with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business we accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible as opposed to probable or if an estimate is not reasonably determinable disclosure of a material claim or contingency is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method the amount of taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is 

recognized in our consolidated statement of income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 

significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities in determining our provision for income taxes we use an annual effective income tax rate based on annual income permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates we adjust the annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available our effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings 

we follow the authoritative guidance included in asc topic 740 income taxes  which contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 

our income tax returns like those of most companies are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities we record an accrual for more likely than not exposures after evaluating the positions associated with our various income tax filings a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified we adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

although we believe that our estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

companyowned stores and direct channels 

while our recognition of revenue does not involve significant judgment revenue recognition represents an important accounting policy for our organization we recognize revenue upon customer receipt of the merchandise we also provide a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on prior experience for direct channel revenues we estimate shipments that have not been received by the customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times 

all of our brands sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers in retail stores through our direct channels and through third parties we do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards we recognize income from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer in addition we recognize income on unredeemed gift cards when we can determine that the 

likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions gift card breakage we determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns gift card breakage is included in net sales in our consolidated statements of income 

franchise and other 

we also recognize revenues associated with franchise and wholesale arrangements revenue recognized under franchise arrangements generally consists of royalties earned upon sale of merchandise by franchisees to thirdparty customers revenue is generally recognized under wholesale arrangements at the time the title passes to the customer 

we recognize revenue associated with merchandise sourcing and production services provided to third parties revenue is recognized at the time the title passes to the customer 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates we use derivative financial instruments like the crosscurrency swaps and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

foreign exchange rate risk 

to mitigate the translation risk to our earnings and the fair value of our investment in la senza associated with fluctuations in the us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate we entered into a series of crosscurrency swaps related to canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans these crosscurrency swaps require the periodic exchange of fixed rate canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate us dollar interest payments as well as exchange of canadian dollar and us dollar principal payments upon maturity the swap arrangements mature between 2015 and 2018 at the same time as the related loans as a result of the canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans and the related crosscurrency swaps we do not believe there is any material translation risk to la senza’s net earnings associated with fluctuations in the us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate

all of our longterm debt as of january 28 2012  has fixed interest rates we will from time to time adjust our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap arrangements the effect of the interest rate swap arrangements is to convert the respective amount of debt from a fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate the variable interest rate associated with these swap arrangements fluctuates based on changes in the threemonth london interbank offered rate libor 

as of january 28 2012  our designated fair value hedges have a notional amount of 175 million  related to a portion of our 2017 notes 

for the balance of our longterm debt that is not subject to the interest rate swap arrangements our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows

 item 1a risk factors tableend we caution that any forwardlooking statements as such term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 contained in this report or made by our company or our management involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors many of which are beyond our control accordingly our future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forwardlooking statements words such as “estimate” “project” “plan” “believe” “expect” “anticipate” “intend” “planned” “potential” and similar expressions may identify forwardlooking statements risks associated with the following factors among others in some cases have affected and in the future could affect our financial performance and actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forwardlooking statements included in this report or otherwise made by our company or our management 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we are not under any obligation and do not intend to make publicly available any update or other revisions to any of the forwardlooking statements contained in this report to reflect circumstances existing after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of future events even if experience or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by those forwardlooking statements will not be realized 

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10k other filings or in any other discussions of our business the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

  

in addition to the other information set forth in this report the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results the risks described below are not our only risks additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business operating results andor financial condition in a material way 

our net sales profit results and cash flow are sensitive to and may be adversely affected by general economic conditions consumer confidence spending patterns and market disruptions 

our net sales profit cash flows and future growth may be adversely affected by negative local regional national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers’ ability or willingness to spend including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war terrorism or the threat thereof in addition market disruptions due to severe weather conditions natural disasters health hazards or other major events or the prospect of these events could also impact consumer spending and confidence levels in particular our operating results are generally impacted by factors in the us and canadian economies purchases of women’s intimate and other apparel beauty and personal care products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak in such circumstances we may increase the number of promotional sales which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our net sales operating income and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis 

we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

seasonal fluctuations also affect our inventory levels since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases we must carry a significant amount of inventory especially before the holiday season selling period if we are not successful in selling inventory we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space 

most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers sales at these stores are derived in part from the volume of traffic in those retail areas our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area including “destination” retail stores to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area competition from other retail and nonretail attractions and other retail areas where we do not have stores 

part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing store 

  

expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel particularly at the store management level and the integration of new stores into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our plans for international expansion include risks that could adversely impact our results and reputation 

we intend to further expand into international markets through license and franchise agreements andor companyowned stores the risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market further entry into this market may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence other risks include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets disruptions or delays in shipments changes in diplomatic and trade relationships political instability and foreign governmental regulation 

we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners as licensees franchisees or in a similar capacity in addition certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store openings and sales we cannot ensure the profitability or success of our expansion into international markets 

in addition our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates more specifically an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could have an adverse effect on our earnings and our financial condition 

these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our licensees and franchisees could take actions that could harm our business or brand images 

we have global representation through independently owned stores operated by licensees and franchisees “partners” although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective partners the level of control we can exercise over our partners is limited and the quality and success of their operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control our partners may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel our brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our partners do not operate successfully these risks could have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our direct channel business includes risks that could have an adverse effect on our results 

our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results risks include but are not limited to the a diversion of sales from our stores which may impact comparable store sales figures b difficulty in recreating the instore experience through our direct channels c domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it overseas outside our control d the failure of the systems that operate the websites and their related support systems including computer viruses theft of customer information privacy concerns telecommunication failures and electronic breakins and similar disruptions and e risks related to our directtoconsumer distribution center any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

  

our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand images 

our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise failure to comply with ethical social product labor and environmental standards or related political considerations could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions including boycotts failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

our failure to adequately protect our trade names trademarks and patents could have a negative impact on our brand images and limit our ability to penetrate new markets 

we believe that our trade names trademarks and patents are an essential element of our strategy we have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names trademarks and patents and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries there can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others if any thirdparty copies our products in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation it could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our inability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could negatively impact our results 

the sale of women’s intimate and other apparel personal care products and accessories is highly competitive we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers including individual and chain specialty stores department stores and discount retailers in addition to the traditional storebased retailers we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through direct response channels brand image marketing design price service quality image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the storebased and direct response channels 

some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing and other resources available in many cases our competitors sell their products in stores that are located in the same shopping malls as our stores in addition to competing for sales we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls 

increased competition could result in price reductions increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our inability to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could negatively impact the image and relevance of our brands 

our success depends in part on management’s ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate saleable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly if we are unable to successfully anticipate identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines our sales will be lower potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory in response we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

  

we rely significantly on foreign sources of production and maintenance of operations in foreign countries 

we purchase merchandise directly in foreign markets and in the domestic market many of our imports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements including existing or potential duties tariffs or safeguard quotas we compete with other companies for production facilities 

we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 new initiatives may be proposed impacting the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions which if enacted would limit or reduce the products purchased from suppliers in such countries 

in addition significant health hazards environmental hazards or natural disasters may occur which could have a negative effect on the economies financial markets and business activity our purchase of merchandise from these manufacturing operations may be affected by this risk 

our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our stock price may be volatile 

our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of quarter to quarter variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry in addition the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 

our failure to maintain our credit rating could negatively affect our ability to access capital and would increase our interest expense 

the credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive if our ability to access capital becomes constrained our interest costs will likely increase which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows additionally changes to our credit rating would affect our interest costs 

  

we may be unable to service our debt 

some of our debt agreements contain covenants which require maintenance of certain financial ratios and also under certain conditions restrict our ability to pay dividends repurchase common shares and make other restricted payments as defined in those agreements our cash flow from operations provides the primary source of funds for our debt service payments if our cash flow from operations declines we may be unable to service or refinance our current debt 

we may be unable to retain key personnel 

we believe we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives including leslie h wexner chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit train and retain other qualified key personnel 

we may be unable to attract develop and retain qualified employees and manage labor costs 

we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer which requires us to have highly trained and engaged employees our success depends in part upon our ability to attract develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including store personnel and talented merchants the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas competition for such qualified individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand delayed store openings significant increases in employee turnover rates or significant increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner and meet quality standards 

we purchase products through contract manufacturers and importers and directly from thirdparty manufacturers factors outside our control such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales cancellation charges or excessive markdowns in addition quality problems could result in a product liability judgment or a widespread product recall that may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on product availability competition reaction and consumer attitudes even if the product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding any assertions could adversely impact our reputation with existing and potential customers and our brand image these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in product input costs 

product input costs including manufacturing labor and raw materials fluctuate these fluctuations may result in an increase in our production costs we may not be able to or may elect not to pass these increases on to our customers which may adversely impact our profit margins these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in energy costs 

energy costs have fluctuated dramatically in the past these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase products from our 

  

manufacturers a continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be adversely impacted by increases in costs of mailing paper and printing 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and catalogue and promotional mailings we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to pass such increases directly onto our customers or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing mailing delivery and order fulfillment systems these risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we selfinsure certain risks and may be adversely impacted by unfavorable claims experience 

we are selfinsured for various types of insurable risks including associate medical benefits workers’ compensation property general liability and automobile up to certain stoploss limits claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile any adverse claims experience could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems 

our success depends in part on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems our information technology systems as well as those of our service providers are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources including telecommunication failures malicious human acts and natural disasters moreover despite network security measures some of our servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses and similar disruptive problems additionally these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer information which could result in damage to our reputation andor litigation despite the precautions we have taken unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores in a timely manner or expose confidential customer information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition we will make modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for pointofsale ecommerce merchandising planning sourcing logistics inventory management and support systems including human resources and finance modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems including accurately capturing data and system disruptions information technology system disruptions if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

we may fail to comply with regulatory requirements 

as a public company we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements our policies procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable foreign and domestic laws and regulations including those imposed by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the sec and the new york stock exchange the “nyse” failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our reputation market price of our common stock results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

  

we may be adversely impacted by changes in taxation requirements

while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required we believe the effects of inflation if any on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements on an ongoing basis management evaluates its accounting policies estimates and judgments including those related to inventories longlived assets claims and contingencies income taxes and revenue recognition management bases our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position 

inventories 

inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or market on a weightedaverage cost basis 

we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of inventory on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

we also record inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory these estimates are based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends 

management believes that the assumptions used in these estimates are reasonable and appropriate a 10 increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 3 million for 2010 a 10 increase or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 2 million for 2010 

valuation of longlived assets 

property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than the carrying value we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset when a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life 

goodwill is reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change the impairment review is performed by comparing each reporting unit’s carrying value to its estimated fair value determined through either estimated discounted future cash flows or marketbased methodologies if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value we determine the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference 

intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change the impairment review is performed 

  

by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset 

we estimate the fair value of property and equipment goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of asc topic 820 fair value measurements and disclosures if future economic conditions are different than those projected by management future impairment charges may be required 

la senza goodwill and other intangible assets 

in conjunction with the january 2007 acquisition of la senza we recorded 313 million in goodwill and 170 million in trade name and other intangible assets as of january 29 2011 the carrying value of goodwill and trade names for la senza is 133 million and 165 million respectively these assets are included in the la senza reporting unit which is part of the victoria’s secret segment 

in the latter half of 2008 la senza was negatively impacted by the global economic downturn and the resulting impact on the canadian retail environment as a result la senza’s operating results deteriorated significantly particularly when compared to our expectations at the time of acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2008 we concluded that the goodwill and certain trade name assets related to the la senza acquisition were impaired and recorded impairment charges of 189 million and 26 million related to the goodwill and trade name assets respectively these impairment charges are included in impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on the 2008 consolidated statement of income 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we concluded that certain trade names would no longer be utilized within the la senza business as a result we recorded an impairment charge of 3 million these impairment charges are included in impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on the 2009 consolidated statement of income 

no impairment charges were recorded related to la senza goodwill and intangible assets during 2010 

impairment testing—goodwill 

we evaluated la senza’s goodwill by comparing the carrying value of the la senza reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit determined through either estimated discounted future cash flows or marketbased methodologies we corroborated the estimated fair value of the la senza reporting unit as determined by our discounted cash flow approach by referencing a marketbased methodology 

based on our 2008 evaluation the carrying value of the la senza reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value as a result we measured the goodwill impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the implied value of the goodwill based on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit considering the estimated fair value of all assets and liabilities as a result of this analysis we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 189 million 

our 2009 evaluation indicated that the estimated fair value of the la senza reporting unit was in excess of the carrying value as a result we were not required to calculate the implied value of goodwill and no impairment was recognized 

  

2010 

our 2010 evaluation indicated that the estimated fair value of the la senza reporting unit was in excess of the carrying value as a result we were not required to calculate the implied value of goodwill and no impairment was recognized 

impairment testing—trade names 

we evaluated the la senza trade name assets by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value determined using a relief from royalty and other discounted cash flow methodologies 

based on our 2008 evaluation the carrying value of certain la senza trade name assets exceeded their estimated fair value and as a result we recognized trade name impairment charges of 26 million 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we made the decision to exit the la senza girl business and recorded an impairment charge of 3 million related to the la senza girl trade name and other minor subbrands our 2009 evaluation of the overall la senza trade name indicated that the estimated fair value was in excess of the carrying value as a result no impairment was recognized with regards to this asset 

based on our 2010 evaluation the estimated fair value of the la senza trade name exceeded the carrying value reasonable changes in the significant estimates and assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value would not have resulted in a trade name impairment 

significant estimates and assumptions 

our determination of the estimated fair value of the la senza reporting unit and trade name assets requires significant judgments about economic factors industry factors our views regarding the future prospects of the la senza reporting unit as well as numerous estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective the estimates and assumptions critical to the overall fair value estimates include i estimated future cash flow generated by la senza ii discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair values iii the terminal value assumption used in the discounted cash flow methodologies and iv the royalty rate assumption used in the relief from royalty valuation methodology these and other estimates and assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and expectations of management and may change in the future based on periodspecific facts and circumstances if la senza’s future cash flows are different than those projected by management additional future impairment charges may be required 

sensitivity analysis 

the following provides sensitivities to our 2010 significant estimates and assumptions as noted above 

 

  

  

   

other impairment 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 we concluded that a subbrand trade name would no longer be utilized within the victoria’s secret business we compared the estimated fair value of the trade name using a relief from royalty methodology to the carrying value and concluded that the trade name was fully impaired as a result we recognized an impairment charge of 6 million this impairment charge is included in impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on the 2010 consolidated statement of income 

claims and contingencies 

we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits insurance regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business our determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the consolidated financial statements is based on management’s view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency we consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seek input from both internal and external experts within and outside our organization with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business we accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible as opposed to probable or if an estimate is not reasonably determinable disclosure of a material claim or contingency is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method the amount of taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our consolidated statement of income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 

significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities in determining our provision for income taxes we use an annual effective income tax rate based on annual income permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates we adjust the annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available our effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings 

we follow the authoritative guidance included in asc topic 740 income taxes  which contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 

our income tax returns like those of most companies are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities we record an accrual for more likely than not exposures after evaluating the positions associated with our various income tax filings a number of years may elapse before a 

  

particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified we adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

although we believe that our estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

retail 

while our recognition of revenue does not involve significant judgment revenue recognition represents an important accounting policy for our organization we recognize revenue upon customer receipt of the merchandise for direct channel revenues we estimate shipments that have not been received by the customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times we also provide a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on prior experience 

all of our brands sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers in retail stores through our direct channels and through third parties we do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards we recognize income from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer in addition we recognize income on unredeemed gift cards when we can determine that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions gift card breakage we determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns gift card breakage is included in net sales in our consolidated statements of income 

other 

we recognize revenue associated with merchandise sourcing and production services provided to third parties revenue is recognized at the time the title passes to the customer 

additionally we recognize revenues associated with franchise and wholesale arrangements revenue recognized under franchise arrangements generally consists of royalties earned upon sale of merchandise by franchisees to thirdparty customers revenue is generally recognized under wholesale arrangements at the time the title passes to the customer 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates we use derivative financial instruments like the crosscurrency swaps and interest rate swap arrangements to manage exposure to market risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

foreign exchange rate risk 

our foreign exchange rate translation exposure is primarily the result of the january 2007 acquisition of la senza corporation whose operations are conducted primarily in canada to mitigate the translation risk to our earnings and the fair value of our investment in la senza associated with fluctuations in the us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate we entered into a series of crosscurrency swaps related to canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans these crosscurrency swaps require the periodic exchange of fixed rate canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate us dollar interest payments as well as exchange of canadian dollar and us 

  

dollar principal payments upon maturity the swap arrangements mature between 2015 and 2018 at the same time as the related loans as a result of the canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans and the related crosscurrency swaps we do not believe there is any material translation risk to la senza’s net earnings associated with fluctuations in the us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate 

in addition our canadian dollar denominated earnings are subject to us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate risk as substantially all of our merchandise sold in canada is sourced through us dollar transactions 

interest rate risk 

our investment portfolio primarily consists of interestbearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which specifies permitted types of investments specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer the primary objective of our investment activities are the preservation of principal the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk currently our investment portfolio is comprised of us and canadian government obligations us treasury and aaarated money market funds bank time deposits and highlyrated commercial paper given the shortterm nature and quality of investments in our portfolio we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates 

all of our longterm debt as of january 29 2011 has fixed interest rates in june 2010 we entered into a series of interest rate swap arrangements related to all of our outstanding 2012 notes all of our outstanding 2014 notes and 175 million of our outstanding 2017 notes in august 2010 we terminated 21 million of these interest rate swap arrangements in conjunction with the repurchase of 20 million and 1 million of 2014 notes and 2012 notes respectively in january 2011 we entered into a series of interest rate swap arrangements related to an additional 150 million of our outstanding 2017 notes the effect of the interest rate swap arrangements is to convert the respective amount of debt from a fixed interest rate to a variable interest rate the variable interest rate associated with these swap arrangements fluctuates based on changes in the threemonth london interbank offered rate “libor” 

for the balance of our longterm debt that is not subject to the interest rate swap arrangements our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows 

fair value of financial instruments 

as of january 29 2011 management believes that the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents receivables and payables approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments 

the following table provides a summary of the carrying value and fair value of longterm debt and swap arrangements as of january 29 2011 and january 30 2010 

 

  

   

     concentration of credit risk 

we maintain cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions currently our investment portfolio is comprised of us and canadian government obligations us treasury and aaarated money market funds bank time deposits and highlyrated commercial paper 

we monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions and other entities with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity we also monitor the creditworthiness of entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business and counterparties to derivative instruments

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” as discussed in item 1 these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10k other filings or in any other discussions of our business the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results the risks described below are not our only risks additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business operating results andor financial condition in a material way 

our revenue profit results and cash flow are sensitive to and may be adversely affected by general economic conditions consumer confidence and spending patterns 

our growth sales and profitability may be adversely affected by negative local regional national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers’ ability or willingness to spend including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war terrorism or the threat thereof 

  

  

in particular our operating results are generally impacted by changes in the united states and canadian economies negative economic conditions may impact the level of consumer spending and inhibit customers’ use of credit purchases of women’s intimate and other apparel beauty and personal care products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak in such circumstances we may increase the number of promotional sales which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

the global economic crisis could also impair the solvency of our suppliers customers and other counterparties 

there could be a number of additional effects from the ongoing economic downturn the inability of key suppliers to access liquidity or the insolvency of key suppliers could lead to delivery delays or failures we provide merchandise sourcing services to other retailers and licensees and grant credit to these parties in the normal course of business which subjects us to potential credit risk additionally we have guaranteed certain lease payments of certain of our former subsidiaries financial difficulties of our customers or those former subsidiaries for whom we guarantee lease payments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition finally other counterparty failures including banks and counterparties to contractual arrangements could negatively impact our business 

the global economic crisis could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources 

the general economic and capital market conditions in the united states and other parts of the world have deteriorated significantly these conditions have affected access to capital and increased the cost of capital although we believe that our capital structure and credit facilities will provide sufficient liquidity there can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be affected by changes in the financial markets or that our capital resources will at all times be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs if these conditions continue or become worse our future cost of debt and equity capital and access to the capital markets could be adversely affected 

our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space 

most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers sales at these stores are derived in part from the high volume of traffic in those retail areas our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area including “destination” retail stores to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area competition from other retail and nonretail attractions and other retail areas where we do not have stores recently sales volume has been adversely affected by the recessionary economic conditions 

part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs 

our net sales operating income and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis 

we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

seasonal fluctuations also affect our inventory levels since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases we must carry a significant amount of inventory especially before the holiday season selling period if we are not successful in selling inventory we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

  

our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel particularly at the store management level and the integration of new stores into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably 

our plans for international expansion include risks that could adversely impact our financial results and reputation 

we intend to further expand into international markets through franchisedistribution agreements andor companyowned stores the risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market further entry into this market may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence other risks include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets disruptions or delays in shipments changes in diplomatic and trade relationships political instability and foreign governmental regulation 

we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners as franchisees distributors or in a similar capacity in addition certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control such as the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store openings and sales we cannot ensure the profitability or success of our expansion into international markets these risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image and reputation as well as our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our licensees could take actions that could harm our business or brand images 

we have global representation through independently owned la senza stores operated by licensees although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective licensees the amount of control we can exercise over our licensees is limited and the quality of licensed operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control licensees may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel our brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our licensees do not operate successfully 

our direct channel business includes risks that could have an adverse effect on our results from operations or financial condition 

our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operational results risks include but are not limited to the a diversion of sales from our stores which may impact comparable store sales figures b difficulty in recreating the instore experience through our direct channels c domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it overseas outside our control d risks related to the failure of the systems that operate the web sites and their related support systems including computer viruses theft of customer information privacy concerns telecommunication failures and electronic breakins and similar disruptions and e risks related to our directtoconsumer distribution center any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand images 

our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity any negative publicity about these types of 

  

  

concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise failure to comply with ethical social product labor and environmental standards or related political considerations could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions including boycotts failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

our failure to adequately protect our trade names trademarks and patents could have a negative impact on our brand images and limit our ability to penetrate new markets 

we believe that our trade names trademarks and patents are an essential element of our strategy we have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names trademarks and patents and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries there can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others if any thirdparty copies our products in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation our brand images could be adversely affected 

our results can be adversely affected by market disruptions 

market disruptions due to severe weather conditions natural disasters health hazards terrorist activities financial crises political crises or other major events or the prospect of these events can affect consumer spending and confidence levels and adversely affect our results or prospects in affected markets the receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain for these purposes may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to fully offset our losses 

our stock price may be volatile 

our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of quarter to quarter variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry in addition the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 

our failure to maintain our credit rating could negatively affect our ability to access capital and would increase our interest expense 

the credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive if our ability to access capital becomes constrained our interest costs will likely increase which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition additionally our failure to maintain our credit rating would result in higher interest costs 

we may be unable to service our debt 

we may be unable to service our outstanding debt or any other debt we incur additionally some of our debt agreements contain covenants which require maintenance of certain financial ratios and also under certain conditions restrict our ability to pay dividends repurchase common shares and make other restricted payments as defined in those agreements 

our cash flow from operations provides the primary source of funds for our debt service payments if our cash flow from operations is adversely impacted we may be unable to service or refinance our current debt 

  

  

our inability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could negatively impact our results 

the sale of intimate and other apparel personal care products and accessories is highly competitive we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers including individual and chain specialty stores department stores and discount retailers in addition to the traditional storebased retailers we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through direct response channels brand image marketing design price service quality image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the storebased and direct response channels 

some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing and other resources available in many cases our competitors sell their products in department stores that are located in the same shopping malls as our stores in addition to competing for sales we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls 

increased competition could result in price reductions increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition the recent recessionary conditions have resulted in more significant competition and our competitors have lowered prices and engaged in more promotional activity 

our inability to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could negatively impact the image and relevance of our brands 

our success depends in part on management’s ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate saleable product offerings far in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly if we are unable to successfully anticipate identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines our sales will be lower potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory in response we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition our brand image may also suffer if customers believe merchandise misjudgments indicate we are no longer able to identify and offer the latest fashions 

we may be unable to retain key personnel 

it is our belief we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives including leslie h wexner chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit train and retain other qualified key personnel 

we may be unable to attract develop and retain qualified employees and manage labor costs 

we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer which requires us to have highly trained and engaged employees our success depends in part upon our ability to attract develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including store personnel and talented merchants the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas competition for such qualified individuals or changes in labor and healthcare laws could require us to incur higher labor costs our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand delayed store openings significant increases in employee turnover rates or significant increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

  

we rely significantly on foreign sources of production and maintenance of operations in foreign countries 

we purchase merchandise directly in foreign markets and in the domestic market we do not have any material longterm merchandise supply contracts many of our imports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements including existing or potential duties tariffs or safeguard quotas we compete with other companies for production facilities 

we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 new initiatives may be proposed impacting the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions which if enacted would limit or reduce the products purchased from suppliers in such countries 

in addition significant health hazards environmental hazards or natural disasters may occur which could have a negative effect on the economies financial markets and business activity our purchase of merchandise from these manufacturing operations may be affected by this risk 

our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner and meet quality standards 

we purchase products through contract manufacturers and importers and directly from thirdparty manufacturers similar to most other specialty retailers we have narrow sales window periods for much of our inventory factors outside our control such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales cancellation charges or excessive markdowns which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in energy costs 

energy costs have fluctuated dramatically in the past these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase product from our manufacturers a continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs both of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

  

we may be adversely impacted by increases in costs of mailing paper and printing 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and catalogue and promotional mailings we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to pass such increases directly onto our customers or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing mailing delivery and order fulfillment systems 

we selfinsure certain risks and may be adversely impacted by unfavorable claims experience 

we are selfinsured for various types of insurable risks including associate medical benefits workers’ compensation property general liability and automobile up to certain stoploss limits claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile any adverse claims experience could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems 

our success depends in part on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems our computer systems as well as those of our service providers are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources including telecommunication failures malicious human acts and natural disasters moreover despite network security measures some of our servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses and similar disruptive problems additionally these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer information which could result in damage to our reputation andor litigation despite the precautions we have taken unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores in a timely manner or expose confidential customer information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition we will make modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for pointofsale ecommerce merchandising planning sourcing logistics inventory management and support systems including human resources and finance modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems including accurately capturing data and system disruptions information technology system disruptions if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

we may fail to comply with regulatory requirements 

as a public company we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements our policies procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations including those imposed by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the sec and the new york stock exchange the “nyse” failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our reputation market price of our common stock results of operations and financial condition 

we may be adversely impacted by changes in taxation requirements 

we are subject to income tax in local national and international jurisdictions in addition our products are subject to import and excise duties andor sales or valueadded taxes in many jurisdictions fluctuations in tax rates and duties and changes in tax legislation or regulation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

  

we may be adversely impacted by certain compliance or legal matters 

we are subject to complex compliance and litigation risks difficulty can exist in complying with sometimes conflicting regulations in local national or international jurisdictions as well as new or changing regulations that affect how we operate in addition we may be impacted by litigation trends including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation market price of our common stock results of operations and financial condition

2009 overview 

we anticipated that the retail environment would continue to be challenging in 2009 our net sales decreased 411 million to 8632 billion driven by a comparable store sales decrease of 4 our operating income increased 279 million to 868 million and our operating income rate improved significantly from 65 to 101 in 2009 our operating income benefited from a 9 million gain associated with the reversal of an accrued contractual liability as a result of the divestiture of a joint venture in 2008 our operating income was negatively impacted by 129 million which included a 215 million impairment charge related to goodwill and other intangible assets for our la senza business a 128 million gain related to the divestiture of a personal care joint venture 23 million of expense related to restructuring activities and a 19 million impairment charge related to a joint venture 

the remainder of our operating income increase was driven by the strength of our holiday assortments which coupled with disciplined inventory management enabled us to reduce our promotional activity during the 2009 holiday season additionally disciplined expense management also contributed to the increase in operating income for additional information related to our 2009 financial performance see “results of operations—2009 compared to 2008” 

during 2009 we focused on the conservative management of fundamentals including

contingent liabilities and contractual obligations 

the following table provides our contractual obligations aggregated by type including the maturity profile as of january 30 2010 

 

  

   

  

    in connection with the disposition of certain businesses we have remaining guarantees of approximately 135 million related to lease payments of express limited stores abercrombie  fitch dick’s sporting goods formerly galyan’s lane bryant new york  company and annex under the current terms of noncancelable leases expiring at various dates through 2017 these guarantees include minimum rent and additional payments covering taxes common area costs and certain other expenses and relate to leases that commenced prior to the disposition of the businesses in certain instances our guarantee may remain in effect if the term of a lease is extended 

the following table details the guaranteed lease payments during the next five fiscal years and the remaining years thereafter 

 

 in april 2008 we received an irrevocable standby letter of credit from express of 34 million issued by a thirdparty bank to mitigate a portion of our contingent liability for guaranteed future lease payments of express we can draw from the irrevocable standby letter of credit if express were to default on any of the guaranteed leases the irrevocable standby letter of credit is reduced through november 1 2010 the expiration date of the letter of credit consistent with the overall reduction in guaranteed lease payments the outstanding balance of the irrevocable standby letter of credit from express was 6 million as of january 30 2010 

our guarantees related to express limited stores and new york  company require fair value accounting in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” in effect at the time of these divestitures the guaranteed lease payments related to express net of the irrevocable standby letter of credit 

  

  

limited stores and new york  company totaled 84 million and 94 million as of january 30 2010 and january 31 2009 respectively the estimated fair value of these guarantee obligations was 9 million and 15 million as of january 30 2010 and january 31 2009 respectively and is included in other longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets the decrease in the fair value from january 31 2009 to january 30 2010 reflects the impact of the current economic environment and our assessment of the risk of default on the guaranteed lease payments 

our guarantees related to abercrombie  fitch dick’s sporting goods formerly galyan’s lane bryant and annex are not subject to the fair value accounting but require that a loss be accrued when probable and reasonably estimable based on us gaap in effect at the time of these divestitures as of january 30 2010 and january 31 2009 we had no liability recorded with respect to any of the guarantee obligations as we concluded that payment under these guarantees was not probable 

off balance sheet arrangements 

we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined by regulation 229303 item 303 a 4 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

accounting standards codification “codification” and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” 

in june 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards codification “asc” subtopic 105 generally accepted accounting principles  which reorganizes the thousands of us gaap pronouncements into roughly 90 accounting topics and displays all topics using a consistent structure it also includes relevant sec guidance that follows the same topical structure in separate sections in the codification in the third quarter of 2009 we changed our historical us gaap references to comply with the codification the adoption of this guidance did not impact our results of operations financial condition or liquidity since the codification is not intended to change or alter existing us gaap 

subsequent events 

in may 2009 the fasb issued authoritative guidance included in asc subtopic 855 subsequent events which incorporates guidance on subsequent events into authoritative accounting literature and clarifies the time following the balance sheet date that must be considered for subsequent events disclosures in the financial statements in the second quarter of 2009 we adopted this guidance which requires disclosure of the date through which subsequent events have been reviewed this guidance did not change our procedures for reviewing subsequent events in february 2010 the fasb issued accounting standards update 201009 to amend asc subtopic 855 subsequent events  to not require disclosure of the date through which management evaluated subsequent events in the financial statements for either originally issued financial statements or reissued financial statements 

derivative instruments and hedging activities 

in march 2008 the fasb issued authoritative guidance included in asc subtopic 815 derivatives and hedging  which requires disclosures about the fair value of derivative instruments and their gains or losses in tabular format as well as disclosures regarding creditriskrelated contingent features in derivative agreements counterparty credit risk and strategies and objectives for using derivative instruments this guidance amends and expands previously released authoritative guidance and became effective prospectively beginning in 2009 in the first quarter of 2009 we adopted this guidance for additional information see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

  

  

consolidation 

in december 2007 the fasb issued authoritative guidance included in asc subtopic 810 consolidation which modifies reporting for noncontrolling interest minority interest in consolidated financial statements this guidance requires noncontrolling interest to be reported in equity and establishes a new framework for recognizing net income or loss and comprehensive income or loss by the controlling interest this guidance further requires specific disclosures regarding changes in equity interest of both the controlling and noncontrolling parties and presentation of the noncontrolling equity balance and income or loss for all periods presented this guidance became effective for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 the statement is applied prospectively upon adoption however the presentation and disclosure requirements are applied retrospectively in the first quarter of 2009 we adopted this guidance recharacterizing minority interest as a noncontrolling interest and classifying it as a component of equity in our consolidated financial statements on june 15 2009 we filed a current report on form 8k to reflect the retrospective application to our annual report on form 10k for the year ended january 31 2009 

fair value measurements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued authoritative guidance included in asc subtopic 820 fair value measurements and disclosures  which provides guidance for fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and instruments measured at fair value that are classified in shareholders’ equity this guidance defines fair value establishes a fair value measurement framework and expands fair value disclosures it emphasizes that fair value is marketbased with the highest measurement hierarchy level being market prices in active markets this guidance requires fair value measurements be disclosed by hierarchy level an entity to include its own credit standing in the measurement of its liabilities and modifies the transaction price presumption 

in february 2008 the fasb delayed the effective date for this guidance to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 

accordingly as of february 3 2008 we adopted the authoritative guidance for financial assets and liabilities only on a prospective basis as of february 1 2009 we adopted the remaining provisions the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity for additional information see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

in january 2010 the fasb issued accounting standards update 201006 which amends asc subtopic 820 fair value measurement and disclosures  this guidance requires new disclosures and provides amendments to clarify existing disclosures the new requirements include disclosing transfers in and out of levels 1 and 2 fair value measurements and the reasons for the transfers and further disaggregating activity in level 3 fair value measurements the clarification of existing disclosure guidance includes further disaggregation of fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and providing disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2009 except for the new disclosures regarding the activity in level 3 measurements which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2010 we will adopt this guidance for the fiscal period beginning january 31 2010 except for the new disclosure regarding the activity in level 3 measurements which we will adopt for the fiscal period beginning january 30 2011 

impact of inflation 

while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required we believe the effects of inflation if any on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor 

  

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements on an ongoing basis management evaluates its accounting policies estimates and judgments including those related to inventories longlived assets claims and contingencies income taxes and revenue recognition management bases our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting our results of operations and financial position 

inventories 

inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or market on a weightedaverage cost basis 

we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of specific inventory items on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

we also record inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory these estimates are based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends 

management believes that the assumptions used in these estimates are reasonable and appropriate a 10 increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 3 million for 2009 a 10 increase or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 2 million for 2009 

valuation of longlived assets 

property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than the carrying value we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset when a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life 

goodwill is reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change the impairment review is performed by comparing each reporting unit’s carrying value to its estimated fair value determined through either estimated discounted future cash flows or marketbased methodologies if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value we determine the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference 

intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change the impairment review is performed by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset 

  

  

the company estimates the fair value of property and equipment goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of asc subtopic 820 fair value measurements and disclosures if future economic conditions are different than those projected by management future impairment charges may be required 

impairment of la senza goodwill and other intangible assets 

in conjunction with the january 2007 acquisition of la senza we recorded 313 million in goodwill and 170 million in trade name and other intangible assets these assets are included in the la senza reporting unit which is part of the victoria’s secret segment 

impairment recognized 

in the latter half of 2008 la senza was negatively impacted by the global economic downturn and the resulting impact on the canadian retail environment as a result la senza’s operating results deteriorated significantly particularly when compared to our expectations at the time of acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2008 we concluded that the goodwill and certain trade name assets related to the la senza acquisition were impaired and recorded impairment charges of 189 million and 26 million related to the goodwill and trade name assets respectively these impairment charges are included in impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on the 2008 consolidated statement of income 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we concluded that certain trade names would no longer be utilized within the la senza business as a result we recorded an impairment charge of 3 million these impairment charges are included in impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on the 2009 consolidated statement of income 

impairment testing—goodwill 

we evaluated la senza’s goodwill by comparing the carrying value of the la senza reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit derived using a discounted cash flow methodology we corroborated the estimated fair value of the la senza reporting unit as determined by our discounted cash flow approach by referencing a marketbased methodology 

based on our 2008 evaluation the carrying value of the la senza reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value as a result we measured the goodwill impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the implied value of the goodwill based on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit considering the fair value of all assets and liabilities as a result of this analysis we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 189 million in 2008 

our 2009 evaluation indicated that the fair value of the la senza reporting unit was in excess of the carrying value as a result we were not required to calculate the implied value of goodwill and no impairment was recognized reasonable changes in the significant estimates and assumptions used to determine the fair value would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment in the la senza reporting unit 

impairment testing—trade names 

we evaluated the la senza trade name assets by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value determined using a relief from royalty methodology 

  

  

based on our 2008 evaluation the carrying value of certain la senza trade name assets exceeded their estimated fair value and as a result we recognized trade name impairment charges of 26 million in 2008 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we made the decision to exit the la senza girl business and recorded an impairment charge of 3 million related to the la senza girl trade name and other minor subbrands our 2009 evaluation of the overall la senza trade name indicated that the fair value was in excess of the carrying value as a result no impairment was recognized with regards to this asset 

significant estimates and assumptions 

our determination of the estimated fair value of the la senza reporting unit and trade name assets requires significant judgments about economic factors industry factors our views regarding the future prospects of the la senza reporting unit as well as numerous estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective the estimates and assumptions critical to the overall fair value estimates include i estimated future cash flow generated by la senza ii discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair values and iii the terminal value assumption used in the discounted cash flow methodologies and iv the royalty rate assumption used in the relief from royalty valuation methodology these and other estimates and assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and expectations of management and may change in the future based on periodspecific facts and circumstances if future economic conditions are different than those projected by management additional future impairment charges may be required 

sensitivity analysis 

the following provides sensitivities to our 2009 significant estimates and assumptions as noted above 

 

  

  

 claims and contingencies 

we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits insurance regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business our determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the consolidated financial statements is based on management’s view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency we consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seek input from both internal and external experts within and outside our organization with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business we accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible as opposed to probable or if an estimate is not determinable disclosure of a material claim or contingency is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method the amount of taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated 

  

  

future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our consolidated statement of income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 

significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities in determining our provision for income taxes we use an annual effective income tax rate based on annual income permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates we adjust the annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available our effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings 

we follow the authoritative guidance included in asc subtopic 740 income taxes  which contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 

our income tax returns like those of most companies are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities we record an accrual for more likely than not exposures after evaluating the positions associated with our various income tax filings a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified we adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

although we believe that our estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

while our recognition of revenue does not involve significant judgment revenue recognition represents an important accounting policy for our organization we recognize revenue upon customer receipt of the merchandise for direct response revenues we estimate shipments that have not been received by the customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times we also provide a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on prior experience 

all of our brands sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers in retail stores through our direct channels and through third parties we do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards we recognize income from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer in addition we recognize income on unredeemed gift cards when we can determine that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions gift card breakage we determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns gift card breakage is included in net sales in our consolidated statements of income 

  

  

additionally we recognize revenue associated with merchandise sourcing services provided to third parties consisting primarily of former subsidiaries as well as other third parties revenue is recognized at the time the title passes to the customer

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk 

the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates we use derivative financial instruments like the crosscurrency swaps and the participating interest rate swap arrangement to manage exposure to market risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

foreign exchange rate risk 

our foreign exchange rate translation exposure is primarily the result of the january 2007 acquisition of la senza corporation whose operations are conducted primarily in canada to mitigate the translation risk to our earnings and the fair value of our investment in la senza associated with fluctuations in the us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate we entered into a series of crosscurrency swaps related to canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans these crosscurrency swaps require the periodic exchange of fixed rate canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate us dollar interest payments as well as exchange of canadian dollar and us dollar principal payments upon maturity the swap arrangements mature between 2015 and 2018 at the same time as the related loans as a result of the canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans and the related crosscurrency swaps we do not believe there is any material translation risk to la senza’s net earnings associated with fluctuations in the us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate 

in addition our canadian dollar denominated earnings are subject to us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate risk as substantially all of our merchandise sold in canada is sourced through us dollar transactions 

interest rate risk 

our investment portfolio primarily consists of interestbearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which specifies permitted types of investments specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer the primary objective of our investment activities are the preservation of principal the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk currently our investment portfolio is comprised of us and canadian government obligations us treasury and aaarated money market funds bank time deposits and highlyrated commercial paper given the shortterm nature and quality of investments in our portfolio we do not believe there is any material risk to principal associated with increases or decreases in interest rates 

all of our longterm debt as of january 30 2010 has fixed interest rates with the exception of our term loan thus our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows the term loan contains a variable interest rate that fluctuates based on changes in an underlying benchmark interest rate and changes in our credit rating in january 2008 we executed a participating interest rate swap arrangement which limited our exposure to increases in the benchmark interest rate while allowing us to partially participate in any decreases in the benchmark interest rate in march 2010 we prepaid the remaining 200 million of the term loan and terminated the remaining portion of the participating interest rate swap arrangement 

fair value of financial instruments 

as of january 30 2010 management believes that the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents receivables and payables approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments 

  

  

the following table provides a summary of the carrying value and fair value of longterm debt and swap arrangements as of january 30 2010 and january 31 2009 

 

  

  the increase in estimated fair value of our longterm debt from january 31 2009 to january 30 2010 reflects the decrease in volatility in the credit markets in comparison to 2008 the change in fair value of the crosscurrency swap arrangements from january 31 2009 to january 30 2010 is primarily due to the fluctuations in the us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate the change in fair value of the participating interest rate swap arrangement from january 31 2009 to january 30 2010 is primarily due to the termination and settlement of portions of the participating interest rate swap arrangements in conjunction with prepayments of our term loan throughout 2009 

concentration of credit risk 

we maintain cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions as well as corporate commercial paper currently our investment portfolio is comprised of us and canadian government obligations us treasury and aaarated money market funds bank time deposits and highlyrated commercial paper 

we monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions and other entities with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity we also monitor the creditworthiness of entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business and counterparties to derivative instruments

our operations are seasonal in nature and consist of two principal selling seasons spring the first and second quarters and fall the third and fourth quarters the fourth quarter including the holiday season accounted for approximately onethird of our net sales for 2008 2007 and 2006 and is typically our most profitable quarter accordingly cash requirements are highest in the third quarter as our inventories build in advance of the holiday season

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” as discussed in item 1 these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10k other filings or in any other discussions of our business the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results the risks described below are not our only risks additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business operating results andor financial condition in a material way 

our revenue profit results and cash flow are sensitive to and may be adversely affected by general economic conditions consumer confidence and spending patterns 

our growth sales and profitability may be adversely affected by negative local regional national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers’ ability or willingness to spend including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war terrorism or the threat thereof 

  

  

purchases of women’s intimate and other apparel beauty and personal care products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak in such circumstances we may increase the number of promotional sales which would further adversely affect our profitability and cash flow 

the current economic crisis has reduced consumer demand which has adversely affected our results of operations and may continue to do so our financial performance in 2008 was significantly impacted by the global economic downturn and its effect on the retail environment 

further deterioration in economic conditions along with increasing unemployment levels may continue to reduce the level of consumer spending and inhibit customers’ use of credit which may continue to adversely affect our revenues and profits through reduced purchases of our products in such circumstances we may increase the number of promotional sales which would further adversely affect our profitability 

the global economic crisis could also impair the solvency of our suppliers customers and other counterparties 

there could be a number of additional effects from the ongoing economic downturn the inability of key suppliers to access liquidity or the insolvency of key suppliers could lead to delivery delays or failures we provide merchandise sourcing services to other retailers and licensees and grant credit to these parties in the normal course of business which subjects us to potential credit risk additionally we have guaranteed the lease payments of certain of our former subsidiaries financial difficulties of our customers or those former subsidiaries for whom we guarantee lease payments could adversely impact our results of operations finally other counterparty failures including banks and counterparties to contractual arrangements could negatively impact our business 

the global economic crisis could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources 

recently the general economic and capital market conditions in the united states and other parts of the world have deteriorated significantly these conditions have adversely affected access to capital and increased the cost of capital although we believe that our capital structure and credit facilities will provide sufficient liquidity through the credit crisis there can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be affected by these changes in the financial markets or that our capital resources will at all times be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs if these conditions continue or become worse our future cost of debt and equity capital and access to the capital markets could be adversely affected 

our net sales depend on a volume of traffic to our stores and the availability of suitable lease space 

most of our stores are located in retail shopping areas including malls and other types of retail centers sales at these stores are derived in part from the high volume of traffic in those retail areas our stores benefit from the ability of the retail and other attractions in an area including “destination” retail and other attractions to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores sales volume and retail traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area competition from other retail and nonretail attractions and other retail areas where we do not have stores recently sales volume and mall traffic has been adversely affected by the recessionary economic conditions 

part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs 

our net sales operating income and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis 

we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a disproportionate effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

  

seasonal fluctuations also affect our inventory levels since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases we must carry a significant amount of inventory especially before the holiday season selling period if we are not successful in selling inventory we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all which in each case may further adversely affect profitability 

our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel particularly at the store management level and the integration of new stores into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably in addition these goals may be adversely affected by the current recessionary conditions 

our plans for international expansion include risks that could materially adversely impact our growth 

we intend to further expand into international markets the risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market in addition we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners for our international expansion further entry into this market may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence we cannot ensure the profitability of our expansion into international markets these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our licensees could take actions that could harm our business or brand images 

we have global representation through independently owned la senza stores operated by licensees although we have criteria to evaluate and select prospective licensees the amount of control we can exercise over our licensees is limited and the quality of licensed operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control licensees may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel our brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our licensees do not operate successfully 

our direct channel business includes risks that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results from operations 

our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operational results risks include but are not limited to the a diversion of sales from our stores which may impact comparable store sales figures b difficulty in recreating the instore experience through our direct channels c domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it overseas outside our control and d risks related to the failure of the systems that operate the web sites and their related support systems including computer viruses theft of customer information telecommunication failures and electronic breakins and similar disruptions any of these events could adversely affect our business 

our failure to protect our reputation could have an adverse effect on our brand images 

our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise failure to maintain high ethical social and environmental 

  

  

standards for all of our operations and activities or adverse publicity regarding our responses to these concerns could also jeopardize our reputation failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

our failure to adequately protect our trade names and trademarks could have a negative impact on our brand images and limit our ability to penetrate new markets 

we believe that our trade names and trademarks are an essential element of our strategy we have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names and trademarks and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries there can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others if any thirdparty copies our products in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation our brand images could be materially adversely affected 

our results can be adversely affected by market disruptions 

market disruptions due to severe weather conditions natural disasters health hazards terrorist activities or the prospect of these events can affect consumer spending and confidence levels and adversely affect our results or prospects in affected markets the receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain for these purposes may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to fully offset our losses 

our stock price may be volatile 

our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of quarter to quarter variations in our actual or projected performance or the financial performance of other companies in the retail industry in addition the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 

our failure to maintain our credit rating could negatively affect our ability to access capital and would increase our interest expense 

the credit ratings agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive if our ability to access capital becomes constrained our interest costs will likely increase our financial condition could be harmed and future results of operations could be adversely affected additionally our failure to maintain our credit rating would result in higher interest costs under our existing debt terms 

we may be unable to service our debt 

we may be unable to service our outstanding debt or any other debt we incur additionally some of our debt related agreements require maintenance of certain financial ratios which limit the total amount we may borrow and also prohibit certain types of liens on property or assets if we violate the financial ratios associated with these debt agreements we may be required to accelerate repayment of this debt 

  

  

our inability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could negatively impact our results 

the sale of intimate and other apparel personal care products and accessories is highly competitive we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers including individual and chain specialty stores department stores and discount retailers in addition to the traditional storebased retailers we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through direct response channels brand image marketing design price service quality image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the storebased and direct response channels 

some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing and other resources available in many cases our competitors sell their products in department stores that are located in the same shopping malls as our stores in addition to competing for sales we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls 

increased competition could result in price reductions increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the recent recessionary conditions have resulted in more significant competition and our competitors have lowered prices and engaged in more promotional activity 

our inability to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could negatively impact the image and relevance of our brands 

our success depends in part on management’s ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate saleable product offerings far in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly if we are unable to successfully anticipate identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines our sales will be lower potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory in response we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our brand image may also suffer if customers believe merchandise misjudgments indicate we are no longer able to identify and offer the latest fashions 

we may be unable to retain key personnel 

it is our belief we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives including leslie h wexner chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit train and retain other qualified key personnel 

we may be unable to attract develop and retain qualified employees and manage labor costs 

we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer which requires us to have highly trained and engaged employees our success depends in part upon our ability to attract develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including store personnel and talented merchants the turnover rate in the retail industry is high and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas competition for such qualified individuals could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand delayed store openings significant increases in employee turnover rates or significant increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

  

we rely significantly on foreign sources of production and maintenance of operations in foreign countries 

we purchase merchandise directly in foreign markets and in the domestic market we do not have any material longterm merchandise supply contracts many of our imports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements including existing or potential duties tariffs or safeguard quotas we compete with other companies for production facilities 

we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 new initiatives may be proposed impacting the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions which if enacted would limit or reduce the products purchased from suppliers in such countries 

in addition significant health hazards environmental hazards or natural disasters may occur which could have a negative effect on the economies financial markets and business activity our purchase of merchandise from these manufacturing operations may be affected by this risk 

our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and may have a material adverse effect on our business 

our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner and meet quality standards 

we purchase products through contract manufacturers and importers and directly from thirdparty manufacturers similar to most other specialty retailers we have narrow sales window periods for much of our inventory factors outside our control such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales cancellation charges or excessive markdowns which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in energy costs 

energy costs have fluctuated dramatically in the past these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase product from our manufacturers a continual rise in energy costs could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs both of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we may be adversely impacted by increases in costs of mailing paper and printing 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and catalogue and promotional mailings we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk 

  

  

mailings and sorting future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to pass such increases directly onto our customers or if we are unable to implement more efficient printing mailing delivery and order fulfillment systems 

we selfinsure certain risks and may be adversely impacted by unfavorable claims experience 

we are selfinsured for various types of insurable risks including associate medical benefits workers’ compensation property general liability and automobile up to certain stoploss limits claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile any adverse claims experience could result in future costs significantly in excess of historical costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems 

our success depends in part on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems our computer systems as well as those of our service providers are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources including telecommunication failures malicious human acts and natural disasters moreover despite network security measures some of our servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses and similar disruptive problems additionally these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer information which could result in damage to our reputation andor litigation despite the precautions we have taken unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores in a timely manner or expose confidential customer information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations controls and reporting 

in addition we are currently implementing modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for merchandise sourcing distribution ecommerce and support systems including finance modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems including accurately capturing data and system disruptions the launch of these successor systems will take place in a phased approach information technology system disruptions if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

we may fail to comply with regulatory requirements 

as a public company we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements our policies procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations including those imposed by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the securities and exchange commission and the new york stock exchange the “nyse” failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation financial condition and on the market price of our common stock 

we may be subject to certain legal matters 

we are subject to complex compliance and litigation risks difficulty can exist in complying with sometimes conflicting regulations in local national or international jurisdictions as well as new or changing regulations that affect how we operate in addition we may be impacted by litigation trends including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation financial condition and on the market price of our common stock

to execute our strategy we are focused on these key strategic imperatives 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 2008 overview 

we anticipated that the retail environment would be challenging in 2008 however the holiday season was much more difficult than expected as a result of the global economic downturn and its impact on the us and canadian retail environment our financial performance in 2008 was significantly impacted by the downturn our net sales decreased 11 to 9043 billion driven by a comparable store sales decrease of 9 and our operating income decreased 521 million to 589 million the decline in our operating income included a 215 million impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets related to our la senza business for additional information related to our 2008 financial performance see “results of operations—2008 compared to 2007”

sfas 159 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities “sfas 159” 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas 159 permitting entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value the standard also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparison between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities if the fair value option is elected the effect of the first remeasurement to fair value is reported as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings the statement is applied prospectively upon adoption we did not adopt fair value treatment for any assets or liabilities under sfas 159 as of the beginning of 2008 

sfas 157 fair value measurements “sfas 157” 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas 157 which provides guidance for fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and instruments measured at fair value the statement defines fair value establishes a fair value measurement framework and expands fair value disclosures it emphasizes that fair value is marketbased with the highest measurement hierarchy level being market prices in active markets the standard requires fair value measurements be disclosed by hierarchy level an entity include its own credit standing in the measurement of its liabilities and modifies the transaction price presumption 

in february 2008 the fasb issued fsp fas 1572 effective date of fasb statement 157 which delays the effective date of sfas 157 to fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually the provision of sfas 157 is applied prospectively we adopted the required portions of sfas 157 at the beginning of 2008 which did not have a material impact to our financial statements adoption of the portions of sfas 157 within the scope of fsp fas 1572 will not have a material impact on our financial statements beginning in 2009 

future accounting changes 

the fasb’s standardsetting process is ongoing and until new standards have been finalized and issued by fasb we cannot determine the impact on the reporting of our operations and financial position that may result from any such future changes the fasb is currently working on several projects including but not limited to revenue recognition liabilities and equity derivatives disclosures earnings per share calculations and leases we are also monitoring the potential adoption of international financial reporting standards in the us the ultimate pronouncements resulting from these and future projects could have an impact on our future results of operations and financial position 

impact of inflation 

while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required we believe the effects of inflation if any on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements on an ongoing basis management evaluates its accounting policies estimates and judgments including those related to inventories longlived assets claims and contingencies income taxes and revenue recognition management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other 

  

  

factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of its board of directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting its results of operations and financial position 

inventories 

inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or market on a weightedaverage cost basis 

we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of specific inventory items on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

we also record inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory these estimates are based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends 

management does not believe that the assumptions used in these estimates will change significantly based on prior experience a 10 increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 6 million for 2008 a 10 increase or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 2 million for 2008 

valuation of longlived assets 

property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than the carrying value we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset factors used in the valuation include but are not limited to management’s plans for future operations brand initiatives recent operating results and projected future cash flows when a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life 

goodwill is reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change the impairment review is performed by comparing each reporting unit’s carrying value to its estimated fair value determined through either estimated discounted future cash flows or marketbased methodologies if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value we determine the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value we recognize an impairment charge equal to the difference 

intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment each year in the fourth quarter and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change the impairment review is performed by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value usually determined using a discounted cash flow methodology 

factors used in the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets include but are not limited to management’s plans for future operations brand initiatives recent operating results and projected future cash flows if future economic conditions are different than those projected by management future impairment charges may be required 

  

  

impairment of la senza goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 

in conjunction with the january 2007 acquisition of la senza we recorded 313 million in goodwill and 170 million in trade name intangible assets these assets are included in the la senza reporting unit which is part of the victoria’s secret segment in the fourth quarter of 2008 we completed our annual impairment testing under sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets “sfas 142” we concluded that goodwill and certain trade name assets related to the la senza acquisition were impaired we recorded impairment charges of 189 million and 26 million related to the goodwill and trade name assets respectively these impairment charges are included in impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on the 2008 consolidated statement of income 

the estimated fair values of our other reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values as of the fourth quarter of 2008 accordingly no goodwill impairment charges were recorded for these reporting units reasonable changes in the significant estimates and assumptions used to determine these fair values would not have resulted in goodwill impairments in any of these reporting units if economic conditions in 2009 and beyond continue to deteriorate future impairment charges may be required 

impairment indicators 

the primary impairment indicator associated with the impairment charge was the deterioration in la senza’s operating results during the latter half of 2008 particularly when compared to our expectations at the time of the acquisition la senza’s operating results were negatively impacted by the global economic downturn and the resulting impact on the canadian retail environment 

impairment testing 

we evaluated la senza’s goodwill by comparing the carrying value of the la senza reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit derived using a discounted cash flow methodology we corroborated the estimated fair value of the la senza reporting unit as determined by our discounted cash flow approach by referencing a marketbased methodology based on our evaluation the carrying value of the la senza reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value as a result we measured the goodwill impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas 142 by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the implied value of the goodwill based on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit considering the fair value of all assets and liabilities as a result of this analysis we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of 189 million 

we evaluated the la senza trade name assets by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value determined using a relief from royalty methodology based on our evaluation the carrying value of certain la senza trade name assets exceeded their estimated fair value and as a result we recognized impairment charges totaling 26 million to reduce the carrying values to their estimated fair values 

significant estimates and assumptions 

the discounted cash flow models used to estimate the applicable fair values involve numerous estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective changes to these estimates and assumptions could materially impact the fair value estimates the estimates and assumptions critical to the overall fair value estimates include i estimated future cash flow generated by la senza ii discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the fair values and iii the terminal value assumption used in the discounted cash flow methodologies these and other estimates and assumptions are impacted by economic conditions and expectations of management and may change in the future based on periodspecific facts and circumstances if economic conditions in 2009 and beyond continue to deteriorate future impairment charges may be required 

sensitivity analysis 

our determination of the estimated fair value of the la senza reporting unit and trade name assets requires significant judgment about economic factors industry factors as well as our views regarding the future prospects 

  

  

of the la senza reporting unit changes in these judgments may have a significant effect on the estimated fair value of la senza’s goodwill and trade name assets the following provides sensitivities related to the significant estimates and assumptions as noted above 

 

  

  

 claims and contingencies 

we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits insurance regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business our determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the consolidated financial statements is based on management’s view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency we consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seek input from both internal and external experts within and outside our organization with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business we accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible as opposed to probable or if an estimate is not determinable disclosure of a material claim or contingency is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method the amount of taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our consolidated statement of income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 

significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities in determining our provision for income taxes we use an annual effective income tax rate based on annual income permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates we adjust the annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available our effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures and the level of earnings 

effective february 4 2007 we adopted fasb interpretation 48 “fin 48” and fasb staff position “fsp” fin 481 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement 109  fin 48 contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas 109 accounting for income taxes  the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes our policy is to include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 

  

  

our income tax returns like those of most companies are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities we record an accrual for more likely than not exposures after evaluating the positions associated with our various income tax filings a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified we adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

although we believe that our estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

while our recognition of revenue does not involve significant judgment revenue recognition represents an important accounting policy for our organization we recognize revenue upon customer receipt of the merchandise for direct response revenues we estimate shipments that have not been received by the customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times we also provide a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on prior experience 

all of our brands sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers in retail stores through our direct channels and through third parties we do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards we recognize income from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer in addition we recognize income on unredeemed gift cards when we can determine that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions gift card breakage we determine the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns we accumulated sufficient historical data to determine the gift card breakage rate at bath  body works and express during the fourth quarter of 2005 and victoria’s secret during the fourth quarter of 2007 gift card breakage is included in net sales in our consolidated statements of income 

during the fourth quarter of 2005 we recognized 30 million in pretax income related to the initial recognition of gift card breakage at express and bath  body works during the fourth quarter of 2007 we recognized 48 million in pretax income related to the initial recognition of gift card breakage at victoria’s secret 

additionally we recognize revenue associated with merchandise sourcing services provided to third parties consisting primarily of former subsidiaries as well as other third parties revenue is recognized at the time the title passes to the customer 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates 

our foreign exchange rate exposure is primarily the result of the january 2007 acquisition of la senza corporation whose operations are conducted primarily in canada to mitigate the translation risk to our earnings and the fair value of our investment in la senza associated with fluctuations in the us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate we entered into a series of crosscurrency swaps related to canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans these crosscurrency swaps require the periodic exchange of fixed rate canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate us dollar interest payments as well as exchange of canadian dollar and us dollar principal payments upon maturity the swap arrangements mature between 2015 and 2018 at the same 

  

  

time as the related loans as a result of the canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans and the related crosscurrency swaps we do not believe there is any material translation risk associated with fluctuations in the us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate 

in addition la senza’s canadian dollar denominated earnings are subject to us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate risk as substantially all of la senza’s merchandise is sourced through us dollar transactions 

we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to our investments and our debt our investment portfolio primarily consists of interestbearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which specifies permitted types of investments specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer the primary objective of our investment activities are the preservation of principal the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk currently our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of us governmentbacked securities given the shortterm nature and quality of investments in our portfolio we do not believe there is any material risk associated with increases or decreases in interest rates 

all of our longterm debt as of january 31 2009 has fixed interest rates with the exception of our 750 million term loan due august 2012 thus our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows our 750 million term loan due august 2012 contains a variable interest rate that fluctuates based on changes in an underlying benchmark interest rate and changes in our credit rating in january 2008 we executed a participating interest rate swap arrangement which limits our exposure to increases in the benchmark interest rate while allowing us to partially participate in any decreases in the benchmark interest rate 

we use derivative financial instruments like the crosscurrency swaps and the participating interest rate swap arrangement to manage exposure to market risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

fair value of financial instruments 

as of january 31 2009 management believes that the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents receivables and payables approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments 

the following table provides a summary of the carrying value and fair value of longterm debt and swap arrangements as of january 31 2009 and february 2 2008 

 

  

     

  

the decrease in estimated fair value of our longterm debt from february 2 2008 to january 31 2009 reflects the substantial increase in volatility in the credit markets and the associated higher yields on our publicly traded debt the change in fair value of the cross currencyswap arrangements from february 2 2008 to january 31 2009 is primarily due to the fluctuations in the us dollar—canadian dollar exchange rate the change in fair value of the participating interest rate swap arrangement from february 2 2008 to january 31 2009 is primarily due to the decline in the underlying benchmark interest rate 

concentration of credit risk 

we maintain cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions as well as corporate commercial paper from time to time currently our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of us governmentbacked securities 

we monitor the relative credit standing of financial institutions and other entities with whom we transact and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity we also monitor the creditworthiness of entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business and counterparties to derivative instruments

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” as discussed in item 1 these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10k other filings or in any other discussions of our business the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business financial condition or future results the risks described below are not our only risks additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business operating results andor financial condition in a material way 

our revenue and profit results are sensitive to and may be adversely affected by general economic conditions consumer confidence and spending patterns 

our growth sales and profitability may be adversely affected by negative local regional national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers’ ability or willingness to spend including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war terrorism or the threat thereof purchases of women’s intimate apparel apparel personal care and beauty products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak in such circumstances we may increase the number of promotional sales which would further adversely affect our profitability 

our net sales depend on a high volume of mall traffic and the availability of suitable lease space 

many of our stores are located in shopping malls sales at these stores are derived in part from the high volume of traffic in those malls our stores benefit from the ability of the mall’s “anchor” tenants generally large department stores and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores and the continuing popularity of malls as shopping destinations sales volume and mall traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area competition from nonmall retailers and other malls where we do not have stores and the closing of anchor department stores in addition a decline in the desirability of the shopping environment in a particular mall or a decline in the popularity of mall shopping among our target consumers would adversely affect our business 

part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return we cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs 

our net sales operating income and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis 

we experience major seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income with a significant portion of our operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a disproportionate effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

seasonal fluctuations also affect our inventory levels since we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases we must carry a significant amount of inventory especially before the holiday season selling period if we are not successful in selling inventory we may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or may not be able to sell the inventory at all which in each case may further adversely affect profitability 

our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings and existing store remodels and expansions 

our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel particularly at the store management level and the integration of new stores into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably 

our plans for international expansion include risks that could adversely impact our growth 

we intend to further expand into international markets the risks associated with our expansion into international markets include difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brands our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market in addition we also have risks related to identifying suitable partners for our international expansion further entry into this market may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with an established market presence we cannot ensure the profitability of our expansion into international markets these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our licensees could take actions that could harm our business or brand images 

we have global representation through independently owned la senza stores operating under license agreements although we have criteria to evaluate and screen prospective licensees the amount of control we can exercise over our licensees is limited and the quality of licensed operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control licensees may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel our brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our licensees do not operate successfully 

our direct channel business includes risks that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results from operations 

our direct operations are subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operational results risks include but are not limited to the a diversion of sales from our stores which may impact comparable store sales figures b difficulty in recreating the instore experience through our direct channels c domestic or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it overseas outside our control and d risks related to the failure of the systems that operate the web sites and their related support systems including computer viruses theft of customer information telecommunication failures and electronic breakins and similar disruptions any of these events could adversely affect our business 

in august 2007 we opened a new distribution center for our victoria’s secret direct business that includes new systems material handling equipment and processes the rampup of the new distribution center to full capacity has been very challenging and has resulted in significant delays in shipping and incurrence of additional costs we expect to continue to incur additional costs into 2008 as a result of these operational challenges 

  

our failure to protect our reputation could have an adverse effect on our brand images 

our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to our brand images our reputation could be jeopardized if we fail to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise failure to maintain high ethical social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities or adverse publicity regarding our responses to these concerns could also jeopardize our reputation failure to comply with local laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

our failure to adequately protect our trade names and trademarks could have a negative impact on our brand images and limit our ability to penetrate new markets 

we believe that our trade names and trademarks are an essential element of our strategy we have obtained or applied for federal registration of these trade names and trademarks and have applied for or obtained registrations in many foreign countries in which our manufacturers are located there can be no assurance that we will obtain such registrations or that the registrations we obtain will prevent the imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights by others if any third party copies our products in a manner that projects lesser quality or carries a negative connotation our brand images could be materially adversely affected 

our results can be adversely affected by market disruptions 

market disruptions due to severe weather conditions natural disasters health hazards terrorist activities or the prospect of these events can affect consumer spending and confidence levels and adversely affect our results or prospects in affected markets the receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain for these purposes may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to fully offset our losses 

our stock price may be volatile 

our stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of our quarter to quarter variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of other companies in the retail industry or the markets we serve in addition the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 

our failure to maintain our credit rating could negatively affect our ability to access capital 

the credit ratings agencies have periodically reviewed our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings any negative ratings actions could constrain the capital available to our company or our industry and could limit our access to funding for our operations we are dependent upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we determine to be attractive if our ability to access capital becomes significantly constrained our interest costs will likely increase our financial condition could be harmed and future results of operations could be adversely affected 

we may be unable to service our debt 

we may be unable to service our outstanding debt or any other debt we incur additionally some of our debt related agreements require maintenance of certain financial ratios which limit the total amount we may borrow and also prohibit certain types of liens on property or assets 

our ability to compete favorably in our highly competitive segment of the retail industry could negatively impact our results 

the sale of intimate and other apparel personal care products and accessories is highly competitive we compete for sales with a broad range of other retailers including individual and chain specialty stores department stores 

  

and discount retailers in addition to the traditional storebased retailers we also compete with direct marketers or retailers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through ecommerce and catalogues brand image marketing design price service quality image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the storebased and direct response channels 

some of our competitors may have greater financial marketing and other resources available in many cases our competitors sell their products in department stores that are located in the same shopping malls as our stores in addition to competing for sales we compete for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls 

increased competition could result in price reductions increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to remain current with fashion trends and launch new product lines successfully could negatively impact our results 

our success depends in part on management’s ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing fashion preferences and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate saleable product offerings far in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer customer demands and fashion trends change rapidly if we are unable to successfully anticipate identify or react to changing styles or trends or we misjudge the market for our products or any new product lines our sales will be lower potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory in response we may be forced to increase our marketing promotions or price markdowns which could have a material adverse effect on our business our brand image may also suffer if customers believe merchandise misjudgments indicate we are no longer able to identify and offer the latest fashions 

we may be unable to retain key personnel 

it is our belief we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives including leslie h wexner chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and our future success will also depend on our ability to recruit train and retain other qualified key personnel 

we may be unable to attract develop and retain qualified employees and manage labor costs 

we believe our competitive advantage is providing a positive engaging and satisfying experience for each individual customer which requires us to have highly trained and engaged employees our success depends in part upon our ability to attract develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees including store personnel the turnover rate in the retail industry is high and qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas competition for such qualified individuals could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay planned openings of new stores or affect the speed with which we expand delayed store openings significant increases in employee turnover rates or significant increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely significantly on foreign sources of production and maintenance of operations in foreign countries 

we purchase intimate apparel merchandise directly in foreign markets and in the domestic market some of which is manufactured overseas we do not have any material longterm merchandise supply contracts many of our imports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements including existing or potential duties tariffs or safeguard quotas we compete with other companies for production facilities 

  

we also face a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 new initiatives may be proposed impacting the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions which if enacted would limit or reduce the products purchased from suppliers in such countries 

in addition significant health hazards environmental hazards or natural disasters may occur which could have a negative effect on the economies financial markets and business activity our purchase of merchandise from these manufacturing operations may be affected by this risk 

our future performance will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond our control and may have a material adverse effect on our business 

our manufacturers may not be able to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner and meet quality standards 

we purchase products through contract manufacturers and importers and directly from thirdparty manufacturers similar to most other specialty retailers we have narrow sales window periods for much of our inventory factors outside our control such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales cancellation charges or excessive markdowns which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the price of oil 

prices of oil have fluctuated dramatically in the past these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase product from our manufacturers a continual rise in oil prices could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs both of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we may be adversely impacted by increases in costs of mailing paper and printing 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of our order fulfillment and catalogue and promotional mailings we rely on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact our earnings if we are unable to pass such increases directly onto our customers or by implementing more efficient printing mailing delivery and order fulfillment systems 

  

we significantly rely on our ability to implement and sustain information technology systems 

our success depends in part on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems our computer systems as well as those of our service providers are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources including telecommunication failures malicious human acts and natural disasters moreover despite network security measures some of our servers and those of our service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses and similar disruptive problems additionally these types of problems could result in a breach of confidential customer information which could result in damage to our reputation andor litigation despite the precautions we have taken unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in our information technology systems sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores in a timely manner or expose confidential customer information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations controls and reporting 

in addition we are currently implementing modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for merchandise sourcing distribution ecommerce and support systems including finance modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems including accurately capturing data and system disruptions the launch of these successor systems will take place in a phased approach over an approximate five year period that began in 2005 information technology system disruptions if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

we may fail to comply with regulatory requirements 

as a public company we are subject to numerous regulatory requirements our policies procedures and internal controls are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations including those imposed by the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the securities and exchange commission and the new york stock exchange the “nyse” failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation financial condition and on the market price of our common stock

executive overview 

strategy 

our strategy supports and drives our mission to build a family of the world’s best fashion retail brands whose welltold stories create loyal customers and deliver sustained growth for our stakeholders 

to execute our strategy we are focused on these key strategic imperatives 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 2007 overview 

overall we were disappointed with our financial performance in 2007 however we did accomplish much in terms of the execution of our business strategy including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition to the changes outlined above we also were faced with a number of other challenges during 2007 first disappointing product launches and a downturn in the retail environment put significant pressure on our gross profit as a result we took actions to reduce our retail inventories by 25 per square foot to minimize our financial risk as we enter 2008 second it took longer than expected to bring our new victoria’s secret distribution center for direct channel business up to capacity resulting in significant incremental costs during the second half of the year as a result of the distribution center challenges we were forced to take actions to reduce the volume of orders in the fourth quarter to protect the customer experience while we worked through the issues in summary we experienced a number of transformational changes in 2007 however we believe that these changes have prepared us to enter 2008 in a better position to focus on the growth and financial performance of our brands 

  

results of operations 

summary of 2007 

our operating results are generally impacted by changes in the overall us economy and therefore we monitor the retail environment using among other things certain key industry performance indicators such as the university of michigan consumer sentiment index which measures consumers’ views on the future course of the us economy the national retail traffic index which measures traffic levels in approximately 1500 malls nationwide and national retail sales which reflects sales volumes of 5000 businesses as measured by the us census bureau these indices provide insight into consumer spending patterns and shopping behavior in the current retail environment and assist us in assessing our performance as well as the potential impact of industry trends on our future operating results additionally we evaluate a number of key performance indicators including comparable store sales gross profit operating income and other performance metrics such as sales per average selling square foot and inventory per selling square foot in assessing our performance

apparel 

in 2007 apparel operating income increased significantly to 259 million primarily due to a pretax gain of 302 million associated with the divestiture of 75 of our ownership interest in express on july 6 2007 we completed the divestiture of 75 of our ownership interest in express to affiliates of golden gate capital for pretax net cash proceeds of 547 million 

the express gain was partially offset by a pretax loss of 72 million associated with the divestiture of 75 of our ownership interest in limited stores on august 3 2007 we completed the divestiture of 75 of our ownership interest in limited stores to affiliates of sun capital as part of the agreement sun capital contributed 50 million in equity capital to the business and arranged a 75 million credit facility 

our remaining investments in express and limited stores are accounted for under the equity method of accounting accordingly we recorded 25 express and limited stores results subsequent to the divestiture date as other income loss in the consolidated statements of income 

in conjunction with the divestitures we entered into transition services agreements with express and limited stores whereby we provide support to them in various operational areas including merchandise sourcing logistics and technology the merchandise sourcing arrangement with mast does have an impact on our segment operating results prior to the divestitures mast’s sales to express and limited stores were eliminated in consolidation subsequent to the divestitures we recognize 75 of those sales resulting in an increase in other sales the gross profit associated with these sourcing sales is at a lower rate than the gross profit on the apparel retail sales we recognized prior to the divestiture 

other 

in 2007 the other operating loss decreased 5 to 251 million primarily driven by the impact of the realignment and resizing of our organization structure during the second quarter of 2007 we initiated a restructuring program designed to resize our corporate infrastructure and to adjust for the impact of the apparel divestitures this program resulted in the elimination of approximately 500 positions or 10 of our corporate and home 

  

office headcount through position eliminations and transfers to express and limited stores although this initiative resulted in severance and other costs totaling 38 million in the second quarter it provided expense reductions in the second half of the year additionally we recognized gains of 25 million in the third quarter related to the sale of corporate aircraft

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

sfas 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities” “sfas 161”

sfas 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “sfas 159” 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas 159 permitting entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value the standard also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparison between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities if the fair value option is elected the effect of the first remeasurement to fair value is reported as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings the statement is applied prospectively upon adoption we do not plan to elect fair value treatment for any assets or liabilities under sfas 159 as of the beginning of 2008 

sfas 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas 157 which provides guidance for fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and instruments measured at fair value that are classified in shareholders’ equity the statement defines fair value establishes a fair value measurement framework and expands fair value disclosures it emphasizes that fair value is marketbased with the highest measurement hierarchy level being market prices in active markets the standard requires fair value measurements be disclosed by hierarchy level an entity include its own credit standing in the measurement of its liabilities and modifies the transaction price presumption

future accounting changes 

the fasb’s standardsetting process is ongoing and until new standards have been finalized and issued by fasb we cannot determine the impact on the reporting of our operations and financial position that may result from any such future changes the fasb is currently working on several projects including but not limited to revenue recognition liabilities and equity derivatives disclosures earnings per share calculations and leases we also expect to see more fasb projects as a result of its desire to converge international accounting standards with gaap the ultimate pronouncements resulting from these and future projects could have an impact on our future results of operations and financial position 

impact of inflation 

our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required we believe the effects of inflation if any on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements on an ongoing basis management evaluates its accounting policies estimates and judgments including those related to inventories longlived assets claims and contingencies income taxes and revenue recognition management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other 

  

factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of its board of directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting its results of operations and financial position 

inventories 

inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or market on a weightedaverage cost basis 

we record valuation adjustments to our inventories if the cost of specific inventory items on hand exceeds the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

we also record inventory loss adjustments for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory these estimates are based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends 

management does not believe that the assumptions used in these estimates will change significantly based on prior experience a 10 increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 6 million for 2007 a 10 increase or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 2 million for 2007 

valuation of longlived assets 

property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than the carrying value we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value usually determined by the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset factors used in the valuation include but are not limited to management’s plans for future operations brand initiatives recent operating results and projected cash flows when a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life 

goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually and may be reviewed more frequently if certain events occur or circumstances change the impairment review is performed by comparing each reporting unit’s carrying value to its estimated fair value intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value factors used in the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets include but are not limited to management’s plans for future operations brand initiatives recent operating results and projected future cash flows if future economic conditions are different than those projected by management impairment charges may be required 

claims and contingencies 

we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits insurance regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business our determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the consolidated financial statements is based on management’s view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency we consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seek input from both internal and external experts within and outside our organization with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business we accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible as opposed to probable or if an estimate is not determinable disclosure of a material claim or contingency is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

  

income taxes 

we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method under this method the amount of taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our consolidated statement of income in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 

significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities in determining our provision for income taxes we use an annual effective income tax rate based on annual income permanent differences between book and tax income and statutory income tax rates we adjust the annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available our effective income tax rate is affected by items including changes in tax law the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures the level of earnings and the results of tax audits 

our income tax returns like those of most companies are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities we record an accrual for more likely than not exposures after evaluating the positions associated with our various income tax filings a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified we adjust our tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from our established accrual the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available

all of our brands sell gift cards with no expiration dates to customers in retail stores through our direct channels and through third parties we do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards we recognize income from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer in addition we recognize income on unredeemed gift cards when we can determine that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions gift card breakage we determine the gift

in 2007 we reviewed our corporate organization and allocation methodology as a result of changes in our business including the divestitures of express and limited stores consistent with these business changes we have transferred certain individuals and functions from corporate to our operating business units further commencing in 2008 we are changing our methodology for allocating certain remaining corporate costs to our operating business units including but not limited to costs related to store real estate and store design and construction activities this change will primarily impact general administrative and store operating expenses across our segments

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates 

our foreign exchange rate exposure is primarily the result of the january 2007 acquisition of la senza corporation whose operations are conducted primarily in canada to mitigate the risk to our earnings and the fair value of our investment in la senza associated with fluctuations in the us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate we entered into a series of crosscurrency swaps related to canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans these crosscurrency swaps require the periodic exchange of fixed rate canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate us dollar interest payments as well as exchange of canadian dollar and us dollar principal payments upon maturity the swap arrangements mature between 2015 and 2018 at the same time as the related loans as a result of the canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans and the related crosscurrency swaps we do not believe there is any material risk associated with fluctuations in the us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate 

we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to our investments and our debt our investment portfolio primarily consists of interestbearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents based on their original maturities our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which specifies permitted types of investments specifies credit quality standards and maturity profiles and limits credit exposure to any single issuer the primary objective of our investment activities are the preservation of principal the maintenance of liquidity and the maximization of interest income while minimizing risk given the shortterm nature and quality of investments in our portfolio we do not believe there is any material risk associated with increases or decreases in interest rates 

the majority of our longterm debt as of february 2 2008 has fixed interest rates thus our exposure to interest rate changes is limited to the fair value of the debt issued which would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows our 750 million term loan due august 2012 contains a variable interest rate that fluctuates based on changes in an underlying benchmark interest rate and changes in our credit rating in january 2008 we executed a participating interest rate swap arrangement which limits our exposure to increases in the benchmark interest rate while allowing us to partially participate in any decreases in the benchmark interest rate prior to the execution of the participating interest rate swap a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in the average term loan interest rate would have resulted in 3 million of additional interest expense during 2007 

we use derivative financial instruments like the crosscurrency swaps and the participating interest rate swap arrangement to manage exposure to market risks we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

fair value of financial instruments 

as of february 2 2008 management believes that the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents receivables and payables approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these financial instruments the estimated fair value of our longterm debt was 28 billion compared to the carrying value of 29 billion at february 2 2008 the estimated fair value of our longterm debt was 16 billion compared to the carrying value of 17 billion at february 3 2007 the aggregate fair value of our foreign currency swap arrangements was a liability of 54 million as of february 2 2008 and a liability of 3 million as of february 3 2007 the fair value of our participating interest rate swap arrangement was a liability of 13 million as of february 2 2008 

concentration of credit risk 

we maintain cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions as well as corporate commercial paper we monitor the relative credit standing of these financial institutions and other entities and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity we also monitor the creditworthiness of the entities to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business

the following chart reflects the retail businesses and the number of company operated stores in operation for each business at february 3 2007 and january 28 2006 

 

   

 the following table shows the changes in the number of retail stores operated by the company for the past five fiscal years 

 

   the company also owns mast industries inc “mast” an apparel importer which is a significant supplier of merchandise for victoria’s secret express and limited stores the company also owns beauty avenues “beauty avenues” a personal care sourcing company serving both victoria’s secret and bath  body works mast and beauty avenues also have 650 million of sales to thirdparties in 2006 and their operating results are included in other in our segment reporting for additional information see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

most of the merchandise and related materials for the company’s stores are shipped to the company’s distribution centers in the columbus ohio area in connection with the distribution of merchandise the company uses a variety of shipping terms that result in the transfer of title to the merchandise at either the point of origin or point of destination 

the company’s policy is to maintain sufficient quantities of inventory on hand in its retail stores and distribution centers so that it can offer customers an appropriate selection of current merchandise the company emphasizes rapid turnover and takes markdowns as required to keep merchandise fresh and current with fashion trends 

the company’s operations are seasonal in nature and consist of two principal selling seasons spring the first and second quarters and fall the third and fourth quarters the fourth quarter including the holiday season accounted for approximately onethird of net sales in 2006 2005 and 2004 accordingly cash requirements are highest in the third quarter as the company’s inventory builds in advance of the holiday season 

the company and its products are subject to regulation by various federal state local and international regulatory authorities the company is subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements 

the company’s trademarks and patents which constitute its primary intellectual property have been registered or are the subject of pending applications in the united states patent and trademark office and with the registries of many foreign countries andor are protected by common law the company believes that its 

  

products and services are identified by its intellectual property and thus its intellectual property is of significant value accordingly we intend to maintain our intellectual property and related registrations and vigorously protect our intellectual property assets against infringement 

competition 

the sale of intimate apparel personal care and beauty products women’s and men’s apparel and accessories through retail stores is a highly competitive business with numerous competitors including individual and chain fashion specialty stores department stores and discount retailers brand image marketing fashion design price service fashion assortment and quality are the principal competitive factors in retail store sales the company’s direct response businesses compete with numerous national and regional ecommerce and catalogue merchandisers image presentation fulfillment and the factors affecting retail store sales discussed above are the principal competitive factors in ecommerce and catalogue sales 

the company is unable to estimate the number of competitors or its relative competitive position due to the large number of companies selling intimate apparel personal care and beauty products women’s and men’s apparel and accessories through retail stores catalogues and ecommerce 

associate relations 

on february 3 2007 the company employed approximately 125500 associates 105100 of whom were parttime in addition temporary associates are hired during peak periods such as the holiday season

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” as discussed in item 1 these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10k other filings or in any other discussions of the company’s business the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect the company’s business financial condition or future results the risks described below are not the only risks facing the company additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect the business financial condition andor operating results of the company in a material way 

the company’s revenue and profit results are sensitive to and may be adversely affected by general economic conditions consumer confidence and spending patterns 

the company’s growth sales and profitability may be adversely affected by negative local regional national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers’ ability or willingness to spend including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war terrorism or the threat thereof purchases of women’s and men’s apparel women’s intimate apparel personal care and beauty products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak in such circumstances the company may increase the number of promotional sales which would further adversely affect its profitability 

  

the company’s net sales operating income and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis 

the company experiences major seasonal fluctuations in its net sales and operating income with a significant portion of its operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a disproportionate effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

seasonal fluctuations also affect the company’s inventory levels since it usually orders merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases the company must carry a significant amount of inventory especially before the holiday season selling period if the company is not successful in selling inventory it may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or it may not be able to sell the inventory at all which in each case may further adversely affect profitability 

the company may be unable to compete favorably in its highly competitive segment of the retail industry 

the sale of intimate and other apparel personal care products and accessories is highly competitive the company competes for sales with a broad range of other retailers including individual and chain fashion specialty stores department stores and discount retailers in addition to the traditional storebased retailers the company also competes with direct marketers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through ecommerce and catalogue direct marketers also include traditional storebased retailers like the company who are competing in the ecommerce and catalogue distribution channels the company’s direct response businesses compete with numerous national and regional ecommerce and catalogue merchandisers brand image marketing fashion design price service quality image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in both the storebased and direct response channels 

some of the company’s competitors may have greater financial marketing and other resources available to them in many cases the company’s competitors sell their products in department stores that are located in the same shopping malls as the company’s stores in addition to competing for sales the company competes for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls 

increased competition could result in price reductions increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

the company may not be able to keep up with fashion trends and may not be able to launch new product lines successfully 

the company’s success depends in part on management’s ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing fashion tastes and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate saleable product offerings far in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer customer tastes and fashion trends change rapidly if the company is unable to successfully anticipate identify or react to changing styles or trends and misjudges the market for its products or any new product lines the company’s sales will be lower potentially resulting in significant amounts of unsold finished goods inventory in response the company may be forced to increase its marketing promotions or price markdowns which could have a material adverse effect on its business the company’s brand image may also suffer if customers believe merchandise misjudgments indicate that the company is no longer able to identify and offer the latest fashions 

the company may lose key personnel 

the company believes that it has benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of its senior executives including leslie h wexner its chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on the business and prospects of the company competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and the company’s future success will also depend on its ability to recruit train and retain other qualified personnel 

  

the company’s manufacturers may be unable to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner or meet quality standards 

the company purchases products through contract manufacturers and importers and directly from thirdparty manufacturers similar to most other specialty retailers the company has narrow sales window periods for much of its inventory factors outside the company’s control such as manufacturing or shipping delays or quality problems could disrupt merchandise deliveries and result in lost sales cancellation charges or excessive markdowns which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

the company relies significantly on foreign sources of production and maintains operations in foreign countries 

the company purchases apparel merchandise directly in foreign markets and in the domestic market some of which is manufactured overseas the company does not have any material longterm merchandise supply contracts and many of its imports are subject to a variety of customs regulations and international trade arrangements including existing or potential duties tariffs or quotas the company competes with other companies for production facilities and import quota capacity 

the company also faces a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 new initiatives may be proposed that may have an impact on the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions which if enacted would limit or reduce the products purchased from suppliers in such countries 

in addition significant health hazards or environmental or natural disasters may occur which could have a negative effect on the economies financial markets and business activity the company’s purchases of merchandise from these manufacturing operations may be affected by this risk 

the future performance of the company will depend upon these and the other factors listed above which are beyond its control these factors may have a material adverse effect on the business of the company 

the company depends on a high volume of mall traffic and the availability of suitable lease space 

many of the company’s stores are located in shopping malls sales at these stores are derived in part from the high volume of traffic in those malls the company’s stores benefit from the ability of the mall’s “anchor” tenants generally large department stores and other area attractions to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of its stores and the continuing popularity of malls as shopping destinations sales volume and mall traffic may be adversely affected by economic downturns in a particular area competition from nonmall retailers and other 

  

malls where the company does not have stores and the closing of anchor department stores in addition a decline in the desirability of the shopping environment in a particular mall or a decline in the popularity of mall shopping among the company’s target consumers would adversely affect its business 

part of the company’s future growth is significantly dependent on its ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs that allow the company to earn a reasonable return the company cannot be sure as to when or whether such desirable locations will become available at reasonable costs 

the company may face labor shortages or increased labor costs which could adversely affect its growth and operating results 

labor is a significant component in the cost of operating the company’s stores if the company faces labor shortages or increased labor costs because of increased competition for employees higher employee turnover rates increases in the federal minimum wage or increases in other employee benefits costs its operating expenses could increase and its growth could be adversely affected the company’s success depends in part upon its ability to attract motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees 

increases in costs of mailing paper and printing may affect the company’s business 

postal rate increases and paper and printing costs will affect the cost of the company’s order fulfillment and catalogue and promotional mailings the company relies on discounts from the basic postal rate structure such as discounts for bulk mailings and sorting future paper and postal rate increases could adversely impact the company’s earnings if it was unable to pass such increases directly onto its customers or by implementing more efficient printing mailing delivery and order fulfillment systems 

the company’s stock price may be volatile 

the company’s stock price may fluctuate substantially as a result of quarter to quarter variations in the actual or anticipated financial results of the company or other companies in the retail industry or markets served by the company in addition the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many retail and other stocks and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 

the company may be unable to service its debt 

the company may be unable to service the debt drawn under its credit facilities andor any other debt it incurs additionally the agreements related to such debt require the company to maintain certain financial ratios which limit the total amount the company may borrow and also prohibit certain types of liens on property or assets 

the company is implementing certain changes to its it systems that may disrupt operations 

the company is currently implementing modifications and upgrades to the information technology systems for merchandise distribution ecommerce and support systems including finance modifications involve replacing legacy systems with successor systems making changes to legacy systems or acquiring new systems with new functionality the company is aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems including accurately capturing data and system disruptions the launch of these successor systems will take place in a phased approach over an approximate five year period that began in 2005 information technology system disruptions if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations 

  

the company relies significantly on its information technology systems 

the company’s success depends in part on the secure and uninterrupted performance of its information technology systems the company’s computer systems as well as those of its service providers are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources including telecommunication failures malicious human acts and natural disasters moreover despite network security measures some of the company’s servers and those of its service providers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic breakins computer viruses and similar disruptive problems despite the precautions the company has taken unanticipated problems may nevertheless cause failures in the company’s information technology systems sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt the company’s ability to process orders and deliver products to the stores in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations controls and reporting 

the company’s results can be adversely affected by market disruptions 

market disruptions due to severe weather conditions natural disasters health hazards terrorist activities or the prospect of these events can affect consumer spending and confidence levels and adversely affect the company’s results or prospects in affected markets the receipt of proceeds under any insurance the company maintains for these purposes may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to fully offset its losses 

the company’s results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the price of oil 

prices of oil have fluctuated dramatically in the past these fluctuations may result in an increase in the company’s transportation costs for distribution utility costs for its retail stores and costs to purchase product from its manufacturers a continual rise in oil prices could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for the company’s products and increase its operating costs both of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s licensees could take actions that could harm our business or brands 

the company has global representation through independently owned la senza stores operating under license agreements although we have criteria to evaluate and screen prospective licensees we are limited in the amount of control we can exercise over our licensees and the quality of licensed operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control licensees may not have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and may not hire and train qualified store managers and other personnel our brand image and reputation may suffer materially and our sales could decline if our licensees do not operate successfully

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in june 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” fin 48 clarifies the recognition threshold and measurement principles for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 the company will adopt fin 48 in the first quarter of 2007 the company is finalizing its evaluation of this interpretation but expects to record a decrease of up to 12 million to retained earnings upon adoption 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas no 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities and only applies when other standards require or permit the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities it does not expand the use of fair value measurement 

  

sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 adoption of sfas no 157 is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

impact of inflation 

the company’s results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required the company believes the effects of inflation if any on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies related to estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements on an ongoing basis management evaluates its accounting policies estimates and judgments including those related to inventories longlived assets claims and contingencies income taxes and revenue recognition management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of its board of directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting its results of operations and financial position 

inventories 

inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or market on a weightedaverage cost basis the company records valuation adjustments to its inventories if the cost of specific inventory items on hand exceeds the amount the company expects to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory these estimates are based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

another significant estimate related to inventories is an adjustment for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory this estimate is based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends 

management does not believe that the assumptions used in these estimates will change significantly based on prior experience however a 10 increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 2 million for the year ended february 3 2007 a 10 increase or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 2 million for the year ended february 3 2007 

valuation of longlived assets 

property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the asset are less than the carrying value the company recognizes a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value usually determined by the discounted future cash flows of the asset factors used in the valuation include but are not limited to management’s plans for future operations brand initiatives recent operating results and projected cash flows when a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life 

  

intangible assets not subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment annually by comparing the fair value to the carrying value goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment by comparing each reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value factors used in the valuation of intangible assets and goodwill include but are not limited to management’s plans for future operations brand initiatives recent operating results and projected cash flows if future economic conditions are different than those projected by management impairment charges may be required 

claims and contingencies 

the company is subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits insurance regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business the company’s determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the consolidated financial statements is based on management’s view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency the company consults with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seeks input from both internal and external experts within and outside the company with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business the company accrues a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible as opposed to probable or if an estimate is not determinable disclosure of a material claim or contingency is made in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

income taxes 

significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of business there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain additionally the company’s tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities although the company believes that its estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

while the company’s recognition of revenue does not involve significant judgment revenue recognition represents an important accounting policy of the company the company recognizes revenue upon customer receipt of the merchandise for ecommerce and catalogue revenues the company estimates shipments that have not been received by the customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times the company also provides a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on prior experience 

all of the company’s brands sell gift cards with no expiration dates the company recognizes income from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer in addition the company recognizes income on unredeemed gift cards when it can determine that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and that there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions gift card breakage the company determines the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns during the fourth quarter of 2005 the company accumulated enough historical data to determine the gift card breakage rate at both express and bath  body works once the breakage rate is determined it is recognized over a 36month period based on historical redemption patterns of each brand’s gift cards gift card breakage is included in net sales in the consolidated statements of income 

during the fourth quarter of 2005 the company recognized 30 million in pretax income related to the initial recognition of gift card breakage at express and bath  body works the company will recognize gift card breakage at our other businesses when adequate historical data exists 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

the market risk inherent in the company’s financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates 

the company’s foreign exchange rate exposure is primarily the result of the january 2007 acquisition of la senza corporation whose operations are conducted primarily in canada to mitigate the exposure to fluctuations in the us dollarcanadian dollar exchange rate the company entered into a series of crosscurrency swaps related to canadian dollar denominated intercompany loans these crosscurrency swaps require the periodic exchange of fixed rate canadian dollar interest payments for fixed rate us dollar interest payments as well as exchange of canadian dollar and us dollar principal payments upon maturity the swap arrangements mature between 2015 and 2018 at the same time as the related loans 

the company uses derivative financial instruments like the crosscurrency swaps to manage exposure to foreign exchange rates the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

management believes the company’s exposure to interest rate risk associated with financial instruments such as investments and borrowings is not material 

fair value of financial instruments 

the carrying value of cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value because of their short maturity the fair value of longterm debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues the estimated fair value of the company’s longterm debt was 16 billion compared to the carrying value of 17 billion at both february 3 2007 and january 28 2006 the aggregate fair value of foreign currency swap arrangements was 3 million at february 3 2007 

concentration of credit risk 

the company maintains cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions as well as corporate commercial paper the company monitors the relative credit standing of these financial institutions and other entities and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one entity the company also monitors the creditworthiness of the entities to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend the following discussion of risk factors contains “forwardlooking statements” as discussed in item 1 these risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this form 10k other filings or in any other discussions of the company’s business the following information should be read in conjunction with item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report 

in addition to the other information set forth in this report the reader should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect the company’s business financial condition or future results the risks described below are not the only risks facing the company additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that are currently deemed to be immaterial may also adversely affect the business financial condition andor operating results of the company in a material way 

the company’s revenue and profit results are sensitive to and may be adversely affected by general economic conditions consumer confidence and spending patterns 

the company’s growth sales and profitability may be adversely affected by negative local regional national or international political or economic trends or developments that reduce the consumers’ ability or willingness to spend including the effects of national and international security concerns such as war terrorism or the threat thereof purchases of women’s and men’s apparel women’s intimate apparel personal care and beauty products and accessories often decline during periods when economic or market conditions are unsettled or weak in such circumstances the company may increase the number of promotional sales which would further adversely affect its profitability 

the company’s net sales operating income and inventory levels fluctuate on a seasonal basis 

the company experiences major seasonal fluctuations in its net sales and operating income with a significant portion of its operating income typically realized during the fourth quarter holiday season any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a disproportionate effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

  

seasonal fluctuations also affect the company’s inventory levels since it usually orders merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases the company must carry a significant amount of inventory especially before the holiday season selling period if the company is not successful in selling inventory during the holiday period it may have to sell the inventory at significantly reduced prices or it may not be able to sell the inventory at all which in each case may further adversely affect profitability 

the company may be unable to compete favorably in its highly competitive segment of the retail industry 

the sale of intimate and other apparel personal care products and accessories is highly competitive the company competes for sales with a broad range of other retailers including individual and chain fashion specialty stores department stores and discount retailers in addition to the traditional storebased retailers the company also competes with direct marketers that sell similar lines of merchandise and who target customers through catalogues and ecommerce direct marketers also include traditional storebased retailers like the company who are competing in the catalogue and ecommerce distribution channels the company’s direct response businesses compete with numerous national and regional catalogue and ecommerce merchandisers brand image marketing fashion design price service quality image presentation and fulfillment are all competitive factors in catalogue and ecommerce sales 

some of the company’s competitors may have greater financial marketing and other resources available to them in many cases the company’s primary competitors sell their products in department stores that are located in the same shopping malls as the company’s stores in addition to competing for sales the company competes for favorable site locations and lease terms in shopping malls 

increased competition could result in price reductions increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

the company may not be able to keep up with fashion trends and may not be able to launch new product lines successfully 

the company’s success depends in part on management’s ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing fashion tastes and consumer demands and to translate market trends into appropriate saleable product offerings far in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer customer tastes and fashion trends change rapidly if the company is unable to successfully anticipate identify or react to changing styles or trends and misjudges the market for its products or any new product lines the company’s sales will be lower and it may be faced with a significant amount of unsold finished goods inventory in response the company may be forced to increase its marketing promotions or price markdowns which could have a material adverse effect on its business the company’s brand image may also suffer if customers believe merchandise misjudgments indicate that the company is no longer able to identify and offer the latest fashions 

the company may lose key personnel 

the company believes that it has benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of its senior executives including leslie h wexner its chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer the loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on the business and prospects of the company competition for key personnel in the retail industry is intense and the company’s future success will also depend on its ability to recruit train and retain other qualified personnel 

the company’s manufacturers may be unable to manufacture and deliver products in a timely manner or meet quality standards 

the company purchases apparel through its whollyowned subsidiary mast an apparel importer through other contract manufacturers and importers and directly from thirdparty manufacturers personal care fragrance and

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r” which replaces sfas no 123 and supersedes apb opinion no 25 sfas no 123r requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be measured at their fair values at the date of grant and recognized as expense over the service period which is generally the vesting period in april 2005 the sec announced that it would delay the required implementation of sfas no 123r from the first interim period beginning after june 15 2005 to the first fiscal year beginning after june 15 2005 accordingly the company will adopt sfas no 123r in the first quarter of 2006 using the “modified prospective” method in which compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted subsequent to the effective date of this statement as well as for the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of the effective date which is january 29 2006 

although it will have no impact on the company’s overall financial position the impact to pretax earnings of adopting sfas no 123r is estimated to be 30 to 37 million in 2006 had the company adopted sfas no 123r in a prior period the impact would approximate the impact of sfas no 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data sfas no 123r also requires tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow in the consolidated statements of cash flows excess tax deductions for future periods cannot be accurately estimated at this time as they depend on the timing of stock option exercises and the company’s share price on the exercise date excess tax deductions for the years ended january 28 2006 january 29 2005 and january 31 2004 have been separately classified as “tax benefit on the exercise of nonqualified stock options” in the consolidated statements of cash flows 

in february 2006 the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 155 “accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments – an amendment of fasb statements no 133 and 140” “sfas no 155” which eliminates the exemption from applying statement 133 to interests in securitized financial assets and allows election of a fair value measurement at acquisition at issuance or when a previously recognized financial instrument is subject to a remeasurement event on an instrumentbyinstrument basis in cases in which a derivative would otherwise have to be bifurcated sfas no 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity’s first fiscal year that begins after september 15 2006 the adoption of sfas no 155 is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows 

impact of inflation 

the company’s results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required the company believes the effects of inflation if any on the results of operations and financial condition have been minor 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period as well as the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to inventories longlived assets and contingencies management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and 

  

various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of its board of directors and believes the following assumptions and estimates are most significant to reporting its results of operations and financial position 

inventories 

inventories are principally valued at the lower of cost or market on a weightedaverage cost basis the company records an adjustment to its inventories if the unit cost of specific inventory items on hand exceeds the amount the company expects to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory this estimate is based on management’s judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience if actual demand or market conditions are different than those projected by management future period merchandise margin rates may be unfavorably or favorably affected by adjustments to these estimates 

another significant estimate related to inventories is an adjustment for estimated physical inventory losses that have occurred since the date of the last physical inventory this estimate is based on management’s analysis of historical results and operating trends 

management does not believe that the assumptions used in these estimates will change significantly based on future experience however a 10 increase or decrease in the inventory valuation adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 1 million for the year ended january 28 2006 a 10 increase or decrease in the estimated physical inventory loss adjustment would have impacted net income by approximately 2 million for the year ended january 28 2006 

valuation of longlived assets 

property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the undiscounted future cash flows from the asset are less than the carrying value the company recognizes a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value usually determined by the discounted future cash flows of the asset factors used in the valuation include but are not limited to management’s plans for future operations brand initiatives recent operating results and projected cash flows when a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life 

intangible assets not subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment annually by comparing the fair value to the carrying value goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment by comparing each reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value factors used in the valuation of intangible assets and goodwill include but are not limited to management’s plans for future operations brand initiatives recent operating results and projected cash flows if future economic conditions are different than those projected by management impairment charges may be required 

claims and contingencies 

the company is subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits insurance regulatory and other matters arising out of the normal course of business the company’s determination of the treatment of claims and contingencies in the consolidated financial statements is based on management’s view of the expected outcome of the applicable claim or contingency the company consults with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seeks input from other experts both within and outside the company with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business the company accrues a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible as opposed to probable or if an estimate is not determinable disclosure of a material claim or contingency is made in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

income taxes 

significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals deferred tax assets and liabilities in the ordinary course of business there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain additionally the company’s tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities although the company believes that its estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

while the company’s recognition of revenue does not involve significant judgment revenue recognition represents an important accounting policy of the company the company recognizes revenue upon customer receipt of the merchandise for catalogue and ecommerce revenues the company estimates shipments that have not been received by the customer based on shipping terms and historical delivery times the company also provides a reserve for projected merchandise returns based on prior experience 

all of the company’s brands sell gift cards with no expiration dates the company recognizes income from gift cards when they are redeemed by the customer in addition the company recognizes income on unredeemed gift cards when it can determine that the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote and that there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift cards to relevant jurisdictions gift card breakage the company determines the gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns during the fourth quarter of 2005 the company accumulated enough historical data to determine the gift card breakage rate at both express and bath  body works once the breakage rate is determined it is recognized over a 36 month period based on historical redemption patterns of each brand’s gift cards gift card breakage is included in net sales in the consolidated statements of income 

during the fourth quarter of 2005 the company recognized 30 million in pretax income related to the initial recognition of gift card breakage at express and bath  body works the company will recognize gift card breakage at victoria’s secret and limited stores when adequate historical data exists 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk 

management believes the company’s exposure to interest rate foreign currency and market risk associated with financial instruments such as investments and borrowings is not material 

fair value of financial instruments 

the carrying value of cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value because of their short maturity the fair value of longterm debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues the estimated fair value of the company’s longterm debt at january 28 2006 and january 29 2005 was 16 billion and 17 billion compared to the carrying value of 17 billion and 16 billion respectively 

concentration of credit risk 

the company maintains cash and cash equivalents with various major financial institutions as well as corporate commercial paper the company monitors the relative credit standing of these financial institutions and other entities and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one entity the company also monitors the creditworthiness of the entities to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business

in may and june 1999 purported shareholders of the company filed three derivative actions in the court of chancery of the state of delaware naming as defendants the members of the company’s board of directors and the company as nominal defendant the actions thereafter were consolidated the operative complaint generally alleged that the rescission of the contingent stock redemption agreement previously entered into by the company with leslie h wexner and the wexner children’s trust the contingent stock redemption agreement constituted a waste of corporate assets and a breach of the board members’ fiduciary duties and that the issuer tender offer completed on june 3 1999 was a wasteful transaction in its own right on july 30 1999 all defendants moved to dismiss the complaint both on the ground that it failed to allege facts showing that demand on the board to institute such an action would be futile and for failure to state a claim plaintiffs did not respond to that motion but on february 16 2000 plaintiffs filed a first amended consolidated derivative complaint the amended complaint which makes allegations similar to the first complaint concerning the rescission of the contingent stock redemption agreement and the 1999 issuer tender offer and adds allegations apparently intended to show that certain directors were not disinterested in those decisions defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on april 14 2000 the motion has been fully briefed oral argument was heard on march 28 2001 and the motion is now under consideration by the court
